S"This place is crowded not just on a Friday night as other reviewers have stated, but also on a Sunday afternoon!  Some local friends wanted to take us off-strip, and I'm glad they picked Firefly.  The food was good (loved the tuna ceviche) and so was the sangria.  While we were there, a small R&B band started playing, and it wasn't long before people got up to dance.  Very diverse crowd, everyone having fun and enjoying the food and music."

I got the sparkling sangria for $3.50, which was sweet and tasty! The steak and mushroom skewers were super filling, loved how the mac n cheese came out hot and crispy, and those dates were unique. Btw I LOVED the bread with the almond butter (had about 8 or so slices of it!).\n\nWe all only needed about one dish to get pretty full. Yummm I'll be back!"

S"If you're in the mood for tapas. Check out Firefly on Paradise next time you're in Las Vegas. Located off the strip and away from all the riff raff, Firefly offers yummy ceviche of red snapper, stuffed dates, roasted eggplant canneloni, tuna carpaccio, baked shrimp with roasted garlic cream, chorizo clams, empanadillas, skewer of beef, and so much more. \n\nI had a great experience here, much better than any of the overpriced fine dining restaurants in Vegas.\n\nWith excellent service and reasonable prices. Tourists, venture off of Las Vegas Blvd and onto Paradise Road!!"

S"Perfect starter to a wild Vegas night.\n\nI love tapas joints and this is one the best.  The menu here is excellent with a wide variety of original dishes that wont break the bank.  The ambiance is loungey hip and the service is excellent.  Ive been here several times with large groups and they have catered nicely to us each time.  Place is pretty popular so dinner time usually has a wait but there is a bar for you to pass the time.  \n\nHere are some of my favorite plates:\n\nFilet Mignon Sliders - Juicy patty full of flavor and deep fried onion strings on top give it a crunch.\n\nFirefly Fries - Goes great with the sliders and good item to share.\n\nChorizo Clams - Delicious! Chorizo adds richness and the broth makes a great dip for the bread.\n\nCrispy Duck Roll - Kind of a small dish, but if your into duck this thing is bomb.\n\nStuffed Dates - Just a real tasty little concoction with great flavor.  Very good appetizer to start things off.\n\nThis place is an off the strip secret for some great fine dining and a perfect warm up to some good times.  Parking is a little tough but you'll manage."

S"A couple of dishes disappointed me this past weekend, but I still had a wonderful time at Firefly.\n\nTip: They do not accept reservations for parties of less than 10 on Fridays and Saturdays, and this place can get really pack. I highly recommend going before 7:30 P.M, or you're going to wait 30 minutes for 2 people, and more depending on the size of your party.\n\nI ordered the Paella (my favorite dish) and it did not disappoint me again. For $18, you get a well made dish and a lot of food here. You can easily share this dish with 4 people. Since it was my favorite dish, I ate 75% of it.   5 / 5 Stars\n\nDo not order the fries here. The portion of the fries were generous (a basket actually), but it was not prepared well at all. McDonald's fries are out of this world when you compare them to Firefly. 1.5 / 5 stars \n\n-Empanadas:  first time eating Empanadas and I actually liked it.  The ground meat inside had a nice textured and it was stuffed inside a pie-like crust. 3.5 / 5 stars\n\n-Mac & Cheese: Macaroni Shells were used in this dish, a little different, but I was fine with it. I would probably avoid ordering this simply because it wasn't as cheesy as I would like, and it definitely did not have a thick crispy layer of cheese crust. 2 / 5 stars\n\n-Stuffed Dates: I actually enjoyed my dates a little more this trip. I definitely enjoyed biting into the almond and tasting bacon at the same time. 4 / 5 stars.\n\nWatermelon Mojita like mostly reviews mentioned, tasted a lot like a Jollyrancher. I'm not a fan of this drink. I would avoid ordering, and stick with the Sangria. 2 / 5 stars\n\nFor dessert, I had the Bread Pudding and it came out cold. I spoke to the server and they corrected it. It was my 2nd time trying this dessert, a lot better the first time. 3.5 / 5 stars"

S"I had my wedding reception here that hosted about 70 people. The planning process with their event coordinator, Valeria was very professional and very accomodating. I was able to bring in my own decorations. They set everything up for us and it was amazing! \n\nNow lets talk about the food. We did the Meal #2 plan I believe, which consisted of 5 tapas: bacon wrapped dates, albondigas, artichoke toasts, and the other 2 I can't remember because I was busy with everything.. They were all amazing! I wish I was able to eat more and enjoy it! We had a salad included in our meal. For the main course, we had steak freitas... AMAZING! and some type of rotissorie chicken. We had seafood paella with the main course and it was one of the best  We also had chocolate cake and flan that was served as the dessert. Oh, and the bar was very convienent as well since it was just for our guests.\n\nOverall, the restaurant staff was great. They were all very welcoming and catered to every need. We had our own private banquet room that fit everyone perfectly. The only downside was it was a bit hot in there. I do plan to eat there the next time I am in Vegas. If I were driving by I probably would have not stopped to eat, but I did find the reviews on yelp very helpful in selecting this location for my wedding reception!"

Pretty good sized menu of tapas, and nothing is ever bland. So much flavor to choose from!

S"I visited friends in Vegas in June, and they brought me here.  I can't thank them enough.  I had previously never had tapas (a huge oversight on my part) and really enjoyed them.  \n\nThe dishes that stand out in my memory are:\n- Tortilla a la espanola (served hot, which was new for me, I'm used to it room temperature or cold, but it was very good)\n- Mushroom tart (delicious, but I'm a sucker for puff pastry and mushrooms)\n- Artichoke toasts (refreshing and tasty)\n\nIt was very crowded, but we were willing to sit outside, even though it was at least in the 90s out there.  I wouldn't recommend taking many out of town guests into the heat of the Vegas night, but I was visiting from Texas, and it's both hot and humid there, so the dry heat was fine.\n\nAs previously noted, the parking lot is somewhat dangerous and busy but the food was worth taking the risk.  This is a good choice if you have a mixed group of vegetarians/meat eaters, as there's a little something for everyone."

S"Firefly is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas and I love their food and sangria SOO MUCH. I haven't really tried anything from their menu that I dislike and I love it! Favorite dishes: stuffed dates, tuna tartare, baked tetilla, manchego mac 'n' cheese, lobster escargot, camerones a la diabla, croquetas, the filet sliders... basically everything.  But I have to give this location one star off because it's near the strip so it's SUPER CROWDED and as a result the service can be a little slow. Also there are a number of sketchy characters in the parking lot (one guy came up to my car to ask me for money, another one yelled at my husband and called him a heathen??!).\n\nBUT they are open later than the other locations which is good for me and my late night tendencies! And it's Firefly so still super yummy."

Great ambiance\n\n*what I USUALLY order & what YOU should order*\n\nCamarones Al Ajillo: 5/5 Is shrimp in this lemon butter sauce with slices of bread. When your eating it I suggest dipping the bread and letting it soak in the butter sauce. My favorite dish!\n\nSteak and Mushroom Skewers: 5/5 yummm its a roasted filet in a creamy garlic sauce. The sauce is a perfect add on dipping sauce for the steak. Compliments the filet's roasted flavor. \n\nSangria (a pitcher): 5/5 Trust me best Sangria in town, 1 glass won't be enough. Even if your with a group of friends I usually can down 2-3 glasses myself because its so delicious. Its not acidic and it tastes like juice with a hint of EXCITEMENT \n \nService: 4/5 The hostess are very sweet, there's usually a wait. The door ways kind of small and hard to maneuver around because there's usually a lot people packed in that small area. The servers are really nice and attentive. \n\nHappy Hour: 5/5 I absolutely love their happy hour, I definitely take a late lunch when ever possible.  its 50% off All Drinks from 3-6pm mon-thur and fridays 3-5 Can't beat that!"

Thursday night until Sunday, this place is always poppin' and packed.  But every time I've gone here, even on Monday's, this place seemed to be packed all the time.  Must have dishes are the Ham & Cheese croquetas, Stuffed Dates, Mac 'n cheese and a pitcher of Sangria.  Start off with Red and then try white or maybe the Mojito.  You'll easily spend 2 hours here with a solid group of friends or even a date.  Each plate looks just as delicious as the girls from Spearmint but you won't have to drop $200 to be satisfied."

However after we arrived the waitress said they will close at 12. We decided to just eat very fast which turned out to be a really bad idea because during the dinner the wait staff were really impatient and rude.\n\nMost of the food were also not as good as the other yelp reviewers said...although I am not sure if it was because it was the Christmas Eve.'

S"Thank you fellow Yelpers for another super recommendation!!  The bf and I took a client and his wife to dinner on Monday evening.  We had reservations and were seated right away.  They have quite an extensive tapas list and the prices are ridiculous!  Ridiculously LOW that is!!\n\nWe ordered 9 tapas plates - each plate had 3 items on it with the exception of the taters and the mac and cheese plate.  We also ordered 3 desserts and had 4 glasses of sangria (total, not each...geez, we aren't lushes...anymore).  Everything was delish!!!   The best part was that  the bill was just a tad over $100.  If we would have had this meal at home it would have been almost double that.\n\nThere is a meat market-ish sort of vibe inside at the bar so if you are looking to pick up a piece of ass and a manchego cheese and serrano ham dish while you are at it, check Firefly out!"

S'This is another another place a Vegas local friend took me to on my recent visit. As with Kaizen, this place has a more locals feel. It is off the strip in the same strip mall as Ruth Chris Steakhouse. This restaurant was doing so well that it opened a restaurant next door called DragonFly. \n\nAnyway, Firefly is Latin inspired tapas restaurant with a good looking bar. They have small patio area. The decor was hip and modern. The food sampling was good and varied. They have an octopus tapa which I tried. The service was OK to good. We were there for a early dinner late afternoon snack so definitely not peak time. \n\nAgain as Kaizen, another Vegas locals place to try if you can tear yourself away from the Strip, stripping clubbing, or strip steaks.'

S"Sounds like this place gets pretty packed. We were in town for a wedding, so we had our 2- and 5-year-old with us and we went at 2pm on a Friday--no wait and we didn't feel weird with our kids at that time of day. Our kids liked the Mac & Cheese, the Apple Salad, and all the Crostinis. Plenty of small items to choose from if you happen to bring your kids like we did.\n\nSome items were a huge hit, and some things were just good. Sounds like the bacon-wrapped dates are the way to go, and it's true, they are pretty amazing--something you'll crave. I also loved the shrimp with chili sauce; lots of spice and flavor. \n\nWe were full but wanted a taste of dessert, so we ordered the Dessert Platter amongst the six of us. We should've ordered another one because we loved all the little desserts. The popular ones were the Chocolate Tres Leches and the Passion Fruit Cheesecakes--I want to go back and order one of those just for myself."

S'We came here for hubby\'s Las Vegas birthday bash.  We\'d been wanting to come here for a few years now but just never made it.  Boy, we were glad we came!!\n\nThis place was bumpin\'....we showed up and the restaurant was already full.  We were promptly seated and quickly served. \n\nWe were a big party so we all ordered what we wanted which meant a lot of food on the table.  At first, they were slow in clearing the plates but eventually this little lady came by and basically patrolled our table, picking up empty plates as soon as the last bite came off of it.  That lady was on top of it, filling waters, clearing plates, getting everything we wanted.  At one point, we saw someone from a departing party hand her a tip on their way out.  Doesn\'t surprise me!  She was awesome! (We tipped her separately too)\n\nFood time!!\n\nI have to admit, there were some hits and some misses.  But the hits very much out shadowed the misses.  \nMisses: \nTomato Bread - I was hoping for the simple version we had all over Barcelona but it turned out to be over-vinegary and the bread wasn\'t nearly substantial enough to sustain the topping so it became soggy very fast.\nLobster Escargot - This dish was overcooked so that the lobster was mushy and not fresh tasting at all.  The seasoning was not enough to make the sauce bread-dipping worthy\n\nHIts:\nPulpo Asado - Roasted octopus...nice portion and the octopus was perfectly cooked and tender to the bite\nPaella - I haven\'t had a good history with paella but I daresay this was my favorite version so far.  The rice was well cooked and the ingredients were perfectly balanced with each other.\nRibeye - This was topped with a blue cheese butter, one of my favorite treatments of steak.  I asked for it medium rare and it was served to me that way, perfect!!\nMushroom Tart - Mushroom gravy-ish thing topping a square of puff pastry. Not exactly a "tart" but delicious nonetheless.\n\nAll in all, it was a great time.  We had the sparkling sangria to drink.  Don\'t expect high octane stuff but it was a great palate refresher.'

The place can get packed especially thurs-Sat, so the waiter can get a little tied up when having to deal with multiple tables. I prefer to dine in the adjoining area that used to be Dragonfly. Since they have their own kitchen, the food comes out faster and there are less tables, so its more intimate. The firefly fries and calamari are awesome! I've also had the brie, fillet sliders, tiera de mar skewers, and baby back ribs. I'll try the dates next. The sangria is delicious, but I prefer their passion fruit mojito which is very refreshing."

The restaurant seems to have a smaller overall space and it gets very busy starting on Friday, lasting through the weekend. I would also only do a late lunch or a super early dinner because the restaurant quickly fills up starting at dinner time.\n\nIf this location is super busy, you may also visit their second location in the Downtown Las Vegas Fremont Street Experience.'

After reading all the reviews on Firefly, we were all geared up for good drinks and grub!  The place, in a strip mall, had a great vibe.  Their was a large group of people next to us and we liked the fun and friendly vibe of the place.  The menu was great, lots of selections, and we enjoyed a decent pitcher of mojitos waiting eagerly for our tapas.  At the waiter's recommendation, my hubbie and I ordered the beaf/ shrimp/ chourizo skewers (very good); stuffed red Spanish peppers (okay but strangely chewy cheese in center--not cooked enough?); calamari (too, too salty--skip it!); cherry crispy duck rolls (dry--skip it); and spinach salad (very good).  But the desserts reigned supreme--the housemade gelato and chocolate tres leche cake is what earned this restaurant three stars.  Considering it's in Las Vegas, the value for the money is good but the quality is only okay, and overall, wouldn't go back considering location off strip and the $15 taxi ride each way from Paris."

I love different things in 1 meal. With firefly you can have multiple things in 1 meal therefor satisfying all your hearts wants and desires. \n\nBeet salad-amazing\nCeviche- spectacular\nSpinach salad- divine\n\nWe probably had about 8 other plates of different stuff that made my tummy happy! They are kinda famous for their different flavored mojitos. I tried my husbands watermelon one, it was good. I tried my father in laws blueberry one, it was good, but I got just a plain lime and mint mojito that was by far the best. Stick to the original.

I thought some of the dishes were very good and some were not executed too well. The best was the tuna tartare and the signature dates wrapped in bacon.\nThe beet salad hardly had any beets. Mainly lettuce. The empanadas were mostly pastry, and the fillings (had a vegetable and meat) needed more seasoning.  The filet sliders could have better better if the steak was not cooked wekk done. Meat was tender, just way overcooked.\nWe had 4-5 other plates.

I was in town with 2 chefs (my friends) who I am always a little nervous to go out to dinner with. Chefs can be hard to please because they really know whats up with food. So the pressure was on a bit.....and surprisingly Firefly stood up to the test! There was not one thing we could complain about (OK our server forgot to tell the chef to not put garlic cream on one of the dishes)....well nothing that important anyway. \nThe food was delicious, every bite! The Sangria brought me right back to Barcelona where I got drunk for the first time. I love a good Sangria. \nI recommend everything, but the Gazpacho, stuffed Piquillo Peppers and Ahi Skewers were my favorites! \nThe atmosphere is great for a date or a party (its gets a tad loud).

The service we had there was pretty good, and the time we waited for our food to come out was pretty much like nothing!  We had two pitchers of Sangria (red and white) and both were delicious.\n\nDo try this place if you love tapas! And if you go, try everything! hehe\n\nI would love to come back here on my next trip to vegas!'

S"I've had good food in the past months, but not grrrreat food!  I've been anxious to try this place since ever since.  I didn't care about doing anything else in Sin City this time around... I just had to try this place out!  \n\nThey start you off with bread, butter, and some olives.  The butter was sweet and silky; if it could keep it's form for a few hours, I'd like some to go.  I'd be snacking on bread and butter all day long. \n\nWe ordered the paella, stuffed dates, tuna tartare w/ taro chips, and lamb kabobs on top of lentils.  The tuna tartare was fresh and lightly seasoned, which went well with the clean and crisp flavors of the taro chips.  The dates were definitely a highlight.  No need to go into lengthy detail--they are as good... as great... as everyone describes them!  If I were to ever host an event or even someday get married, stuffed dates would be on the menu!   The lamb was tasty and the lentils were evenly cooked.  I had to take baby bites thinking that our paella was coming out.  However, we find out that our server didn't take that order down.  (Boo.. minus one star.)  He said it would take 10 minutes; so I impulsively told my bf to order another dish to fill the 10 minute void.  (We could've just eaten the kabobs, but like most Asians, we'd rather have our protein with rice.)  So, he ordered the steamed mussels.  I thought steamed would mean boring.  But boy, was I wrong.  Another solid dish!  The red broth or sauce the mussels were soaked in was freaking awesome!  (They can have their one star back.)  I couldn't quite pick out the flavors, but I did taste some ginger.  Sometimes ginger can be a bit overpowering, but this was nice and subtle.  And then our paella finally came.  The paella, which had a combo of clams, mussels, chicken and chorizo, was good, but by the time it came out, we were stuffed.  We=me+bf.  We caved in to gluttony, but felt no remorse.\n\nWith Firefly's nice play on texture and awesome flavors, this was truly an unforgettable dining experience.  Firefly rocks!"

S'luv this place it gets rather busy some nights so its best to sometimes call ahead. Its a laid back joint the meals are cheap but can add up if you get quite a bit of them. I always get the bacon wrapped dates, camarones diabla its shrimp in a spicy sauce really good, tomato soup is good, everythings pretty good. also has pitchers of sangria'

S"Visiting from Chicago, I was excited to give this tapas place a try. I came in with a party of 12 or so not too long ago and was pleasantly surprised at the array of choices of their tapas menu along with the option of choosing entrees instead if tapas is not your thing.  The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our large group-  points for that! \n\nFor drinks I tried a blood orange mojito- very good and strong- another plus. Tried their sangria, equally good.\n\nFor food, I opted to share the shrimp ceviche with a friend and ordered the machengo mac n' cheese and filet mignon sliders for myself. Out of the three I would have to say I enjoyed the ceviche the most. The sliders were a bit over cooked and although my friends all raved about the mac and cheese, mine failed to impress. It seemed as though the cheese in mine had coagulated while I was working on my sliders- bummer.\n\nOne thing I found funny and a bit creepy (non related to their services/food) was a customer coming out of the bathroom and then sneaking a picture of us has he walked by. Awkward!\n\nOverall I would recommend firefly as a great place for drinks after work, not sure if they offer happy hour or not but this would be a decent place to go. Given the opportunity to go again I would be okay with giving the food a second try- perhaps  trying an entree next time..."

S"what an off strip find in vegas..\ni'm not sure if you can call them tapas because their portions are so freaken huge.. usually when u go to tapas places their portions are like 2 bites each.. this place nearly doubles those portions.. we went in a big group and ordered about 3 tapas per couple.. plus a paella to share.. and boy that was ALOT of food.. \nthe server was really nice and chatted with us even thought they were pretty stacked.. i wish he had told us that we were overordering.. but too much of a good thing is never a bad thing. \none very cool thing was.. that they forgot to put the seafood into our paella.. i didn't even notice.. until they brought a second one to the table WITH seafood.. that was a sweet doubleup...\nhighlights are the patatas bravas... tierra y mar skewers.. beef shrimp AND chorizo? i'm in heaven... stuffed dates.. camarones diablas\ndef a must visit in vegas restaurant."

S"My date and I checked this place out on a late Wednesday night.  I'm new to tapas but she wasn't.  We both enjoyed this place though I have to say it was way too cool for a self-professed nerd.  The clientele varied, but more and more club-bound groups came in as the night grew later.\n\nFor the amount of food we ate (2 sangria, 7 dishes including paella) our bill came out to a very reasonable $60 without tip.  The hostess was polite and the wait staff was one of the most attentive and efficient crew I've ever seen. Even they looked like they enjoyed working the place.\n\nTake a cab to Firefly as the restaurant shares a strip mall with it's sister restaurant Dragonfly and a Ruth Chris's.  Parking is crowded.  Don't worry about finding a cab to your next destination; with the number of restaurants in the immediate area there are always two or three cabbies idling in the lot."

S"Holy Tapas, Batman! I will never again eat anywhere else in Las Vegas. Ok, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But this place knocked me off my feet. I'm in love. The food was delicious and filling, the service was great, and it was DIRT CHEAP. For ten people, the bill came to $30 a person for dinner AND drinks. And I was able to get a Red Bull Vodka for $5. That's almost unheard of in Vegas! \n\nLet me just give you a sampling of what we sampled. (This is a Tapas place, after all, so everything is small. But you just keep ordering and they keep throwing the plates at you and it's wonderful.) \n\n-Ceviche of shrimp (shrimp with avocado in a light broth)\n-Stuffed dates  (I usually hate dates but i LOOOOOVED these. It's dates stuffed with bleu cheese and wrapped in bacon. DROOL.)\n-Veggie empanada\n-Firefly fries (with parmesan cheese, herbs, and aioli dipping sauce)\n-Stuffed peppers (red bell peppers with mozarella and tomato sauce)\n-Baked brie (with tomato and chorizo)\n-Manchego Mac 'n' Cheese (DELISH; I'd never heard of Manchego cheese before but had it again the next day; it's kind of parmesan-ish)\n-Stuffed mushrooms (with chicken and chorizo)\n-Chicken skewers\n-Camarones al ajillo (shrimp in lemon-garlic butter sauce)\n\nIs your mouth watering yet? This place was fantastic, and I recommend it to anyone with taste buds."

S"Very solid place to sit down and have fun with a group of friends over a pretty varied menu of tapas plates to try from. We went around 5 oclock on a weekday and it was  happy hour, ordered a decent pitcher of red wine sangria for half price. They also has sparkling and white wine sangria, as well as mojitos. My girl and I tried....\n\n- Crispy duck rolls (Way heavy on the tangy sauce)\n- Calamari (Recommended by waiter, but as good as any seafood place)\n- Firefly Fries (Not a bad basket of fries with Parmesan cheese and seasonings)\n- Cheese stuffed figs (MMMhhh)\n- Stuffed mushrooms (Tasty as well, but nothing outstanding)\n\nThe rest of the party's dishes looked pretty good as well. I would say atmosphere more than the food makes it an enjoyable place to be with friends. Although the prices are not too expensive and you order as much as you want to eat. I think my friends and I might come here again next time we're in vegas."

S'On our last night in Vegas, we had a work dinner at Firefly. My boss actually scouted this place on Yelp and made a reservation. Good job, bossman! Needless to say, I was excited about this place all week due to the raving Yelp reviews, and my fellow Yelpers did not lead us astray!\n\nWe started with the Sparkling Sangria, which was delicious! Then I sat back and watched my two coworkers, who I lovingly refer to as "Woodchipper 1.0," and "Woodchipper 2.0" literally suck down plate after plate after plate of delicious food. I wish I would have videotaped this scene, it was epic. \n\nThe bacon wrapped dates were probably the most amazing thing I have I ever tasted in my entire life. Seriously! I think the "Woodchippers" had at least 25 of those each. \n\nAll in all, we had the best time. Great laughs, great food, and great times! I highly recommend this joint. It is straight awesome sauce. :)'

S"Wow, what a nice trendy place to get a few bites and drinks before hitting the club! I came on a Thursday night and this place was definitely 'poppin' with people.\n\n Myself + two decided to sit at the bar due to the quicker service.  This was only my second time here and it had been years since my first visit. A lot of tapas to choose from, creating a great variety! The prices were also very inexpensive, which already puts this place on my good list. The other 2 weren't too hungry so they opted to order a few drinks while choosing to nibble on calamari. However, I came with an empty stomach so I choose the Thai Beef Salad which sounded very appetizing at the moment. The calamari was pretty standard and would satisfy anyone's craving for this fried seafood appetizer. However, the Thai Beef salad was basically a salad with beef. Nothing in it made it Thai other than the name. \n\nOther than the so so salad, definitely a great experience and will be coming here more often with friends before getting our dance on at the club."

Obviously, I will never go back to this place or their sister restaurants, the way I felt for a week is not worth the risk. I was there with a friend and we had their sparkling sangria, rib eye steak with fries, stuffed dates, apple and manchego salad and mussels with chorizo.  Their service was great and their food taste as their usual, but unfortunately one day later I ended up getting salmonella. I was at a volunteer event when my symptoms started, I actually had to leave the place and go home because I could not even walk straight.  The diarrhea started when I got home and then the abdominal cramping came, it was as if I were a girl in my period. Gals, I know what you go through and I feel ya!

We walked in easily at 6:45pm--seated with water too. Out of a party of 7, each ordered two tapas, then a paella. Favorites: warm spinach salad, lentil and veggies, veg tempura, firefly fries and mac and cheese. The dessert tapas are good too, we had the pistachio, choc and vanilla gelato, nutella/banana sandwiches, and the lemon berry tartlets. Not a really a family friendly restaurant, favors the lounging/bar types, however come early and savor the happy hours specials, prob one of the best deals in this two star town."

Dinner for 8 was super cheap $150 and that is with alcohol and we were stuffed.\n\nWe had the white sangria...it was yummy tasted like juice.  I seriously think we over ordered.  We had the tuna tartare, sliders, calamari, ceviche, paella and a bunch of other stuff.  Everything was pretty good and once again the prices were great.

S'I\'m going to write this review from a different perspective this time, and that is from a large group dining situation.  I was in charge of planning a bachelor party dinner for a group of 25, and that proved to be no small task for Las Vegas.  Most of the places I tried wanted any combination of the following: a very strict prix fixe menu, a signed contract, a minimum of $100/person (not including alcohol, tax, and tip) and a 50% deposit up front.\n\nI usually stop by Firefly at least once every Vegas trip so I am well aware of how amazing their food is.  I figured to give them a shot at hosting our group after unsuccessfully booking at Tao, SushiSamba, and a number of other restaurants on the Strip.  Regina was extremely helpful, more so than I could have ever asked for!\n\nFirefly required a prix fixe menu, but they let me select 6 dishes + 1 dessert that would be served.  The choices I had were of a large variety so we had everything for literally every taste in the group.  The best part was that the food was all you can eat, so the restaurant brought out one complete round of the 6 dishes, and if anyone wanted any more of any dish, the kitchen would cook it right up and send it out.  Unlimited food and "basic" beverage (i.e. coffee, tea, soda) came out to be $32.50/person before tax and tip.  This was by far the best dinner value I found for a large group!  The next closest value I could find was $75/person at Tao.\n\nDuring the planning phase I must have emailed the restaurant a dozen times and every single time, Regina was very prompt with her response.  This was a great relief because I was so used to not getting a response from some of the restaurants on the Strip.  I don\'t quite understand why some of those other places would make it so hard for me to book a group reservation, but I am glad Firefly came in and saved the day.  They required a credit card number to hold the reservation, but nothing was charged until the day of the event.  This was very nice because I didn\'t want to have to front the entire bill for the group before the trip.\n\nThis was my first large group planning, and I don\'t envy those of you charged with the same task.  Let me tell you, do yourself a favor and give Firefly a shot.  You can read virtually any of the other reviews to know about their food and atmosphere, but if you need reassurance that they can admirably handle your large group, I hope I have provided that.  Kudos to you, Firefly!'

I actually came across Firefly on Yelp and from the reviews was anxious to try it.  We ate here on 2/10/12 and...what can I say....the food was excellent, the prices were fair and the sangria was potent!!  I can\'t wait to go back and share this place with my family and friends.  One thing to remember - it\'s not like this place is a secret, you can tell it\'s a favorite of locals and tourists who ask around will hear about this restaurant.

My only real complaint was that the table it not nearly big enough for the drinks and numerous plates they bring but again when you taste the food the wait, crowd, and over stuffed table are small potatoes. \n\nLastly, as a DIE HARD Foo fan...

We ordered the sangria (red, they also have white and sparkling) which was excellent. \n\nWe ordered 4 different tapas - eggplant cannelloni, tortilla, stuffed mushrooms and fried potatoes. The eggplant cannelloni was my favorite, with crispy slices wrapped around goat cheese. The tortilla was not exactly like I'd had it in Spain - it came layered on toothpicks - but it was decent as were the potatoes. I didn't try the mushrooms because they had chorizo, but my friends said they were good. \n\nThe service was very attentive, refilling our water every five minutes and answering questions about the menu items. Our entire bill came to $26. I will definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas."

S"based on single dinner at the bar. \n\ni was on a business trip and ended up here based on yelp recomendations from my yelp peeps back home. it was a tuesday night, but the place was still pretty busy. i ordered the chorizo clams, grlled octopus, fries, and a sangria. PLENTY of food for one.  \n\nthe fries came out quick and the sangria was poured instantly. the octopus was excellent. the clams, well, had too much chorizo. or should i say, the chorizo didnt have enough clams. it was more of a chorizo dish than a clam dish. kind of overwhelming when expecting clams, but don't get me wrong, i'll order it again. \n\noverall bill was 30$ and i was stuffed. I ddnt finish the fries. id definitely go back, but would rather share the food with some company and get a chance to try more menu items..."

S"This was everything I could have asked for in a dinner experience. \n\nWe had a busy night ahead, so we planned for an early dinner. Even at 5pm on a Wednesday, it was pretty hopping, but with no wait. We inadvertently arrived during happy hour, so our drinks were 1/2 price...a very pleasant surprise when we got the bill.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, they had by far the best sangria I've ever had...3 days of steeping will do that. Their pomegranate mojitos and martinis were also incredible. \n\nBetween the two of us, we shared 4 plates, which was plenty to be on the verge of stuffed. The plates were bigger than I expected and every dish was wonderful in its own right.\n\nThe Mushroom Tart was very tasty, with flaky buttery layers in the tart, a hearty and deeply flavorful mushroom sauce, and tender, thiny sliced mushrooms...and that was the dish we were least excited about :)\n\nThe Tuna Tartare was to die for. It literally melted in your mouth, with bit of avocado, sesame seeds and other flavors that blended together for the perfect balance, served with thin crisps that offered a lovely texture contrast.\n\nThe Thai Beef Salad had thin, seared slivers of tender beef, cucumbers, ginger, and a fresh savory dressing over a crispy romaine bed of lettuce. I could have consumed my body weight in it, and never felt guilty.\n\nAnd the best for last - the Petite Filet - was hands-down our favorite. The steak was tender and beautifully prepared. The roasted potatoes were seasoned with something I couldn't put my finger on, but I'd really love to track it down...it was amazing. Add a bit of saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms and it was a dish that was a masterpiece.\n\nAll that culinary joy, plus 3 delicious drinks and tip came in under $60 during happy hour. I can't recommend the quality for price point more!\n\nThe atmosphere was hip and a little close. You'll definitely be sitting next to your neighboring diners closely enough that they could lean over and ask what that dish is that is making your eyes roll back in your head, so I wouldn't expect a private romantic dinner. But it was a lively, fun environment with friendly, attentive waitstaff (ours had an impressively tall Mohawk). \n\nAll in all, I see what the hype is all about!"

S'One of those spots that have been there forever and you still don\'t get tired of it. Pretty much having the same same menu for years but that\'s what makes it awesome. Why fix what is not broken right? that principle works like a charm with this fellas\n\nMost plates are tapas style which means they are small, however its a good thing that they are because you can start exploring the menu. The paella however, is big enough to share.\n\nTry the pulpo asado if you feel a little risky and willing to experience its amazing flavor. Tetilla cheese for the cheese lovers or camaron a la diabla for those who like  it hot.A must try is their filet Mignon sliders with cheese and the garlic fries Don\'t kiss a vampire after them fries though. Actually don\'t kiss anything .and not because your newly uber stinky breath ..but because you don\'t want to share all that awesome garlic flavor left inside your mouth\n\nWaiting time can get crazy. specially on the weekends this place tends to get packed and loud..not because of the music but the people around you. The decor is great and the music is very good and goes perfect with the ambiance. Red is a predominant color so if you are a bull please dont be hitting the walls.\n\nBefore leaving try their well known signature drinks. Their mojitos are delicious!! And the sangria is refreshing and super tasty. A whole pitcher of the sangria and 3 mojitos might make you stand up on a table..get a red napkin and cry to the Madrid and Barcelona gods as loud as you can : "OLE OLE!!!..Yes it was fun..dont judge me..well at least until security came in...Viva espana y hasta manana!!'

S'Ah, Firefly. Where do I even begin?\n\nRight. I begin with sangria, like I always do. Happy hour gets you half off sangria plus a free tapas. A pitcher during regular hours will be around $18 and should get two people through dinner at around three glasses each. They offer red, white, and sparkling sangria. I can\'t say I\'ve tried any other than the red; why mess with perfection?\n\nA free bread basket is always good, especially when it comes with the amazing herb butter they make in-house. Olives are served on the side.\n\nThe menu isn\'t huge but seems daunting. You absolutely have to read the titles and the descriptions of each dish. Does "Stuffed dates" sound appealing? Maybe it does, but the additional "bacon wrapped, smoked almond, red wine reduction, blue cheese" can\'t hurt.\n\nAssuming you\'re a party of two, and you\'ve waded through the menu, order at least three things per person. Of course, at happy hour for a snack, one item is perfect, but I\'m talking dinner here. Some dishes that my other half and I never fail to order: Stuffed Dates (sometimes one order for each of us; an order gets you five), Chicken and Chorizo Stuffed Mushrooms, Manchego Mac n Cheese, Mushroom Tart, and Petite Filet. Some that are not always necessary but we love them: Patatas Bravas, Albondigas, Crispy Duck Rolls, and Steak and Mushroom Skewers. We probably end up with ten different dishes every time we go there.\n\nI would like to make it through the entire menu, but my go-to plates are so delicious that I\'m only able to try one or two new things every time! Last time I did get the Crispy Duck Rolls for the first time, and I will definitely be getting them again. I haven\'t tried any of their five entrees, but I\'m intrigued by the Paella and will try it soon.\n\nThis is another do-not-skip-dessert place. There are very few places where I must have dessert; this is one of them. At least every second time I eat at Firefly, I order the Chocolate-Cherry Bread Pudding. Actually, desire would be a more appropriate word. I desire this dessert. Bread pudding is my favorite dessert, and this is one of the best I\'ve ever had.\n\nFirefly has two locations. One is downtown in the Plaza hotel, with a gorgeous view of Fremont street from a big glass dome where most of the seating is. The other is on Paradise, near the Hard Rock, convenient for visitors from the Strip, with excellent ambiance and an outdoor patio. The food is excellent and the menu is the same at both locations.\n\nParking is easy and free. Reservations are a good idea; they can be made via OpenTable.'

S"I do like this restaurant, but I am not sure what the big hype is all about. \n\nThe food is good but in my opinion the taste is not worth the price. There is just nothing about the flavor that makes this restaurant stand out. So either every time I have gone there I order the wrong things (doubtful) or there really is nothing that stands out about their food. I am from the Netherlands, which is not too far from Spain (where everyone always goes for vacation), and have had amazing Spanish food before that the food at Firefly's does not even come close to measuring up to. \n\nThe only thing I have had that I would ever go back to eat that is completely worth it is their ribeye entree. Makes up for all the other dishes, like the flavorless paella. \n\nOther than that the restaurant is beautiful and upscale compared to the average restaurant. Perfect place to take a date for the second or third time (might be too expensive for the first if you are a poor university student like me) or to have a dinner celebration. The staff was wonderful. \n\nIf you are just looking for a good eatery and aren't eating out for any special occasion, I probably wouldn't suggest this place."

S"Another 6 star if I could!! No this is not my first time at Firefly so I can write a well rounded review. However, every single time I go to Vegas I make sure that I stop at Firefly for some of their stuffed dates, mar y tierra skewers, their sangria (fave is red) and calamari. This is ohhh so good and it's not uber expensive if you were eating on the strip or a buffet. This last time was for a bachlorette fiesta and we had 13 guests. The drinks were flowing and the food was coming and the bill was less than $400 (with tip). AND we order desert. Not bad if you ask me especially since we had at least 8 pitchers of sangria. \n\nHit up Firefly is you want something different that wont cost you mega bucks."

S'It was a warm evening in Vegas so we decided to take a walk down to the Bellagio and watch the fountain show. At first we thought maybe we\'d eat in the Bellagio, but after looking around on Yelp we found this tapas bar with pretty good reviews. \n\nWe hailed a cab and took the short ride to Firefly on Paradise. It was packed at 8:30pm, people outside waiting with drinks in hand, the bar jammed, all the tables filled with cheerful people. Looks like a happy place to eat and celebrate another great weekend with my girlfriend. \n\nSo we check out the menu and literally decide to order 3/4\'s of the dishes offered. The waiter , who was a friendly soul tried to persuade us to only order half, we overruled him and said ("bring it on") we\'re hungry. \n\nI\'m not sure if it was just to busy, but the food was just average, it almost tasted as if it had been prepared ahead of time. The breads weren\'t toasted, the lamb chops so so, serrano ham covered in peppers (big mistake), mussels and clams OK just not memorable. I can go on and on talking about the calamari, stuffed peppers, white anchovies (great) duck egg rolls, tuna tar tare, octopus and potatoes, but in the end Firefly on Paradise is just OK. Not terrible but far from a Lola Gaspar. After eating close to 15 dishes we thought it best to walk back to the hotel.'

Bacon-wrapped figs, shrimp in spicy sauce, chorizo-chicken stuffed mushrooms, thai-style ginger salad, baby beets salad, stuffed peppers, tetilla cheese fondue - everything was outright delicious. Also don't miss on Sangria - made at a restaurant with red, white and sparkling wines - not too sweet and just with the right balance of fruit and sugar - very tasty. Great prices.\n\nAlso have to commend the service - our waitress Sandy was very friendly and helpful, all the food came out promptly and at a write temperature.

S'This place is the shiiiiiiiiit.\n\nMy first time in Las Vegas, so we decided to go off the strip and get some tapas. I\'ve had the real thing in Spain so I was a little cautious as to their food and what they considered "authentic tapas." The place is very quiet and intimate, which was a great departure from the hustle and bustle of the strip. \n\nDo I remember what I ate? Nope. All I know is that every single thing I had was delicious. The sangria was delicious and very dangerous because it tasted like juice and I had to ask the waiter twice if they had put alcohol in it. \n\nThe kicker was the dessert, I\'m a Nutella stan so I tried the Banana Nutella Sandwich...the gates of heaven opened, angels sang, and my life is complete. \n\nI would recommend reservations just in case.'

However of our 4 different dishes, none impressed :(\nLobster bites was good (how can you mess up lobster lol) but nothing spectacular and not worth the price in our opinion)\nexact same feelings for the Shrimp tempura, which was more crispy strings than shrimp.\nChicken chorizo was a disappointment, we made bootleg stuffed mushrooms mixing in whatever we had in the fridge that came out better than these.\nI couldnt really eat the slidders since they had a sauce on it that Im picky about but wife said they were good, not special.'

The stuffed dates are a must. Tuna Peppers were quite tasty with just the right amount of spice. The fish sticks were delicious with a nice sauce for dipping.  And the Lamb Skewers were also very good, cooked to perfection. \n\n However, once the waiter dropped off our food, he never checked in on us again. I expect a waiter to come by within at least 10 minutes of getting your food.  If he had, we would have ended up ordering another order of the stuffed dates, as well as another round or two of drinks.  But instead, 20 minutes after dropping off our food, we had to flag him down just to get our check.  It was not busy inside at all, so there was really no excuse for such crap service.  He had 0 personality, which was surprising considering his very exciting hair. \n\nBut like I said, the food was amazing, but our waiter ruined the whole experience.

I've been to Firefly twice and have enjoyed their food thoroughly both times.\n\nMy friend and I started off with baby back ribs and filet mignon sliders with an additional side order. The portions are small, so if you wanted order a little bit of everything, you could definitely get a stab at a good portion of the menu. A pitcher of Red Sangria was perfect to wash the food down with. We ended the evening with a dessert platter which was excellent! Very easy on the taste buds.. \n\nThe service for the evening was great. Our server was great with his timing and very attentive to our needs... So you're probably wondering why I docked one star? Well.. I know this place is loud.. but certain people were noticebly loud even in such an environment.. There was a guy with a group of his friends, obviously coked out of his mind, screaming obscenities over his cell phone and smacking himself in the face, acting like a primate on speed... I ignored this the whole time, but my friend was obviously extremely bothered by it... We stayed cool about it, cuz we understand there's obviously people who can't handle even being in Vegas without obliterating every part of themselves that make them human... I just wish the staff may have noticed this and at least took the time to tell him to calm down..\n\nSo other than poor version of Kid Rock on crack, the rest of the experience was fine.

I could have sat and had this all day, were I not driving. It was fruity, fresh, sweet, delicious. One of the best drinks I've ever had.\n\nThe tapas were a mixed bag, but I think that speaks more to my boy's tastes than to the quality of the food. The anchovies were (shocker) salty, the mussels were (shocker) a bit fishy. But everything else was delicious and I absolutely adored it all. \n\nI'll definitely return on my next trip to Vegas.

S"Firefly is simply the best near-strip restaurant.  The only downside: a lot of people now know this, and the relatively small restaurant is now pretty much always packed (and I believe they do not take reservations).  However, the food and service is well worth the wait (or the risk of a wait).\n\nThe menu is HUGE and is constantly being changed and added to, and I've yet to try something that I didn't like.  I few suggestions that I enjoy: the bacon wrapped stuffed dates are a must try, along with the ham & cheese croquetas.  The firefly fries are amazing, and big enough to share, as are the calamari.  Other suggestions include the Thai beef salad, the tuna tartar and shrimp ceviche, stuffed pepper, mac n cheese, baked talapia, and the mergeuz.  Don't fill up on the entrees too much, because the tres leches cake is probably the best thing on the menu, so save room for dessert.  \n\nFirefly is also known for its selections of sangria, infused vodkas (vodka + fresh squeezed juices), and mojitos, all of which are great - my favorites are the infused vodka on the rocks, and the passion fruit and blood orange mojitos.  \n\nGo here with a small group and order in small batches, I'd suggest 2 plates per person, per batch.  The food comes out very quick and the table can get very cluttered, very fast.  Most of the dishes here are fairly cheap, but it is very easy to go overboard and run up a large bill, especially if it's you're first visit.\n\nEven though I hate how crowded this place has become, the food is well worth the short trip off the strip, and is a must try for anyone who hasn't tried this gem yet."

I have only had the red sangria, but it is very delicious. I only wish the fruit was a tad larger, so I could enjoy it more when my glass is finished.\n\nI love the artichoke hearts. They are the perfect starter. The ceviche of shrimp is fresh and very flavorful. The terra y mare skewers were one of my favorites there. Packed with flavor and the salsa verde on them adds the perfect touch. The sliders are amazing. The mac 'n' cheese is divine. The babyback ribs fall off the bone. The only thing I have had so far that I really didn't care for was the empanada.\n\nFor dessert I had the gelato.

I saw my server three times total, but there was a really nice guy who kept coming around and taking care of me.  But when I asked him if our server split his tips, the guy was like "sometimes" so I ended up tipping him along with my server (who I didn\'t want to tip at all because he didn\'t do anything, but he just never came back with my change).  Also our server forgot to put in one of my orders (steamed mussels) but he made up for that with free "birthday flan" which is funny since it really was my birthday.'

It's like a really sexy party in your mouth, where you're outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party. \n\nThe atmosphere was intimate and fun. Even on a Sunday night, there were hardly any table to spare, including the outside balcony area. Sort of a youngish, hip crowd. \n\nWe ordered practically everything on the menu, since we wouldn't have a chance to go there very often being out-of-towners. It's really refreshing to eat off of the Vegas Strip. \n\nA few key points:\n\n-Very good food\n-Yummy Sangria\n-The price is unbeatable (6 people and the bill came to $136)\n-Good vibe/ambiance\n-Friendly service\n\nTwo thumbs up and a wink!"

The bread and butter spread they bring is super yummy.\n\nA few of my personal favorites from the menu:\nbacon wrapped dates!!!\ntomato soup and grill cheese\npupusa (octopus) this is divine\nsliders\nroasted peppers\nempenadas\ngoat cheese and beet salad\nfries\n\nThey also serve a very tasty infused fruit vodka and the service is always friendly and fast.\n\nAwesome low prices, especially for the quality and hoppin atmosphere.  I would especially recommend this to tourists, however I'd like to keep it as a secret gem for us locals!"

S"I love everything about Firefly. The food, the ambiance, the drinks. It's such a great place to go when you're in the mood for drinks. I can't imagine going here and not ordering food though. My favorite tapas are the stuffed dates and the warm spinach salad. For drinks I prefer their red sangria and mango mojito. I've been meaning to try their sparkling sangria since I've heard it's delicious as well. This is a place I am always up for going to. Easily one of my favorite places in town."

S"Firefly is the one Vegas restaurant we always make sure to take family and friends that visit.  The food is absolutely incredible, the drinks are great, atmosphere is nice, it's pretty cheap (especially for the quality you get), and it's open late.\n\nMy go-to favorites are the tortilla a la espa\xc3\xb1ola, stuffed peppers, manchego mac 'n' cheese, and petite filet.  The tortilla a la espa\xc3\xb1ola has just the right amount of spiciness, the stuffed peppers are bursting with flavor, and the mac 'n' cheese is the best I've ever had (and I try the mac 'n' cheese everywhere I go).\n\nFor drinks, the blood orange mojito and white sangria are absolute must-haves.\n\nThe service has always been great.  \n\nIt tends to be pretty empty during the day, but can get quite crowded in the evenings.\n\nAnd they're great about accommodating large groups."

S"Why I have not raved about this place yet, I don't know. It's my go-to place when I have visitors, when I just want to sit with a friend over coffee and sangria, dine with family, have a girls' night, a business meeting, or a date. So, really, any damn time is a good time for Firefly.\n\nMy besties were visiting this weekend and we made Saturday night a date night, stopping here before hitting the town. The Mrs. had been here with me a couple years ago but this was the first time Mr. had been. Sacrificing virgins to Firefly is a great way to spend an evening!\n\nWe knew there would be a wait, so I put my name in and we headed to the bar for a pitcher of the red sangria. Unlike the cold red wine I had recently in another establishment, Firefly sangria is *real* sangria. Real fruit, real care, real flavors. I have come here just for the sangria. Top notch.\n\nThe atmosphere, I find, is always one of two things: boisterous and social and fun (without being overwhelmingly loud), or quiet and casual. Tonight was the former, and it was perfect. Patrons at the bar were engaging and personable, yet we still had our space, our own conversations, and time to ourselves while we waited. People watching is a must.\n\nWe were offered a table after only ten minutes or so and led to a hightop out on the patio. It was a little warm (duh, I know), and just as they bring heaters outside in the winter, some low-breeze fans would make a difference in the summer. When we were hit with a natural cross breeze, we noticed a huge difference. Just a thought.\n\nMmmm... FOOD! Stuffed dates, of course. Crispy, rich, and amazing. The Mrs. and I knew this going in. The Mr. is now a fan. Yay! A new disciple!\n\nEggplant canneloni, one of my favorites. I can't eat pasta, so this is a great, mouthwatering twist of goat-cheesy goodness on an old Italian standby! Molto bene!\n\nAlbondigas (meatballs). The Mrs. and I didn't care too much for the dish overall. I found the meat a little dry but raved about the flavors of the sauce. The Mr., however, really enjoyed them.\n\nThe ceviche was good as far as the seafood and avocado, but there was too much of the liquid in the dish and it had a little too much of an acidic flavor. \n\nThe gazpacho was FANTASTIC. Some of the best any of us ever had. So fresh, so clean, just this side of spicy, and at once simple and complex in the layering of flavors. Really, really amazing. A must have.\n\nThe steamed mussels were good... until we found a rotten one. It was only one, but it ruined the dish for us. On the plus side, the liquid and the mussels WERE very good and tasty, but for that one... So we talked to the waiter, showed him, and sent it back without a replacement (which was offered, of course). It was too bad, truly, and I will be trying them again.\n\nThe lamb chops came out medium rare instead of rare and those we had replaced. Everyone was great about it and they came out the second time perfectly cooked, melt-in-your mouth tasty. The bed of veggies and lentils are more than a salad or garnish, but a dish of their own. Also amazing and very well received.\n\nInstead of dessert we opted for a second pitcher of the red sangria and enjoyed the space, each others' company, and the buzz of the people around us. \n\nService is always top notch, friendly, and helpful. The hiccups tonight were just that, hiccups. They were addressed as they should be and the experience was still fantastic. A great night and a great example of why this place is a 5-star favorite everytime I go."

S"As other reviews has stated, this place bears a strong resemblance to the Cheesecake Factory. The restaurant itself is quite large, so even during the dinner rush we were seated within 5mins of putting our names down. Once we were seated, we spent  a good 10mins going through the pages and pages of the menu. Luckily, they served warm bread & butter to munch on while deciding on what to eat. \n\nWe all ended up choosing a 'medium plates', which was actually still too big for any of us to finish. My housemade pierogies were so delicious! Light, fluffy potato dumplings served on top of braised short ribs & mushrooms.. mmm. I also tried a bit of the kobe (softball-sized) meatballs in the creamy cheesy polenta which were also great. Our appetizer of wings were also moist inside with a nice crunchy exterior. Yum! Considering how much food they give, the prices are definitely reasonable and they are open 24/7, which is perfect for everyone in Vegas!"

S'I hope I\'m reviewing the right Grand Lux Cafe as there are two on the same street?    The place is huge and reminded me of the Cheesecake factory with it\'s many offerings, but on a grander scale and less "franchisey" than the Cheesecake factory.  \nService was good, just a touch snobby as I felt they frowned upon us bringing a kid in.  Maybe it\'s just me.\nThe short rib sloppy joe was great (thanks to my yelper friend Len for recommendations) and prices were reasonable.  I expected it to be much higher.   \nOverall, I would recommend this as a great place to go if you\'re in Vegas.  \nIf I happen to be in the area, I would come here again.   There\'s enough choices to please everyone.'

S'We enjoyed a large group (30+) dinner at Grand Lux after our meetings at a conference. Grand Lux was happy to help us out with a reservation on a Tuesday night. \n\nDespite our huge group, service was punctual but no effort was made to be friendly. Water glass was full and food arrived in a timely manner.\n\nThe best part about Grand Lux is that there is something on the menu for everyone. From pasta, to steak, to fried chicken and waffles; yes, your picky eater will find something. \n\nOur table ordered several appetizers, and the crowd favorite was the asian tacos. A must-try if you\'re looking for just a tad bit of an adventure!\n\nAnd although my company was footing the bill, I was still peeved that many of the drinks (beers on tap, mixed drinks) did not have a price associated with them on the menu. \n\nI ordered a plain old (or so I thought!) caesar salad for dinner. It was under the "small salad" listing, but it was definitely large enough to share between two people and certainly big enough for an entree for one. I only ate half of mine. \n\nOverall, this was a great choice for a large group because of the diversity of the menu. With all the other great places in Vegas it wouldn\'t be my personal first choice, but certainly it\'s a crowd pleaser!'

S"I went here twice during my last trip. \n\nSometimes what is lacking in Vegas is a middle ground restaurant, especially in Venettian. You want a restaurant atmosphere, but don't want to pay $200 just to have a meal for two. Yet, you don't feel like paying $15 for a greasy Philly Cheesesteak at the food court. Grand Lux is your middle ground restaurant. Its owned by the creators of Cheesecake Factory and its basically the same to me. Different menu, but still diverse and extensive. Perfect when you need something casual and have a lot of mouths to feed.\n\nMy first experience was very pleasant. I had the most attentive, kind, and honest waiter I've had in years....and...he was new!  When I first ordered, he made sure my party knew that the portions are generous. Personally, I like it when they're honest that the portions can be too much and sharing is encouraged for people with smaller appetites, even though it could affect their total tip.\n\nI ordered a pasta and requested for no olives. The kitchen made a mistake and added olives so they had to redo it. I never saw the plate with the olives because my waiter caught it before it was delivered to me. He apologized repeatedly for the tardiness, but I was fine since I wasn't in a hurry and he was just so nice...its hard to be upset. The manager also came over to apologize at one point. Finally, I got my pasta. I just wish they would clarify that it was chicken chorizo on the menu, it makes a difference since I was expecting large chunks/slices of chicken.\n\nI ended up tipping the guy almost 25% in cash and wished him luck before he left. He was such a doll, I would take him home.\n\nSecond time I went? Disaster! Snobby waiter who was giving us horrific service. Ignored us most of the time, didn't like the fact that a couple members in my party wanted to share a meal. When he was passing the meals over, he wouldn't even lean over to hand me mine, he just held it up in the air and I had to reach for it. Didn't refill my drinks until I was getting ready to leave! What's the point then? Didn't even give our party a basket of bread unlike the tables surrounding us. Lazy!\n\nHowever, I think he's just the bad apple of the group. As my previous waiter was great and the manager wasn't bad either.\n\nI would still go here just because it is nice to have something in the middle for dining, plus the menu accommodates just about anyone that's with you. I just hope my service is as good as my first visit."

S'I went to this place a few months ago and really enjoyed my dinner but I just came back from Vegas and visited this place once again and found that this time around, my experience wasn\'t as pleasant.  5 of my girlfriends and I decided to eat here the next morning/afternoon because we were pretty much too hungover to venture outside the hotel (we were staying at the palazzo).  To cut to the chase... here are the pros and the cons:\n\nPros:\n-the food is pretty good - i\'ve had the miso salmon here before (a while back) & the seared tuna appetizer was a perfect blend of flavors to keep you mouth-watering satisfied.\n-it\'s a fairly reasonable place to dine that won\'t empty out your wallet.\n-the portions are pretty big.\n-free bread.\n-freshly baked cookies. =]\n\nCons:\n-I have to agree with Carolyn C., the floors are extremely slippery! I thought I was going to fall walking in and out of the restaurant!\n-the servers tend to disappear on you for long, and i mean LOOOOONG periods of time\n-they say they have a "soup of the day" then return after about 15 minutes of you ordering it to tell you they ran out of "soup of the day" at around 7pm.  \n-food takes a long time to come out, and the refills for your drinks take just as long... except when the manager comes to your table, the server shows up instantaneously to ask what\'s wrong and why the manager was at the table.\n-my friends that ordered the BLT sandwich and the mashed potatoes weren\'t thrilled with their meal... as they put it, "it wasn\'t that great"'

S'I guess the comparisons to cheesecake factory is fair.  But I think the food quality is better and their cooks aren\'t as sloppy.  \n\nI drove the herd here on a weekday morning for breakfast.  Just beat the morning rush hour....10am-ish. \n\nStarted with a "Paul Bunyan" sized Latte.  Very good.  Then I ordered the corn beef hash and eggs.  HANDS DOWN, the best CB Hash i\'ve ever had.  Sure its pricey, but its rare to see REAL chunks of shredded corn beef.  Not minced and ground like mush, but chopped strips of beef.  Damn....it was that good.  Throw in a couple of fresh eggs over easy, and wheat toast with preserves.  Definitely in my top 10 breakfasts of all time.\n\nI really liked the decor and seats.  All oversized so it was a big thumbs up for me....especially for those who are 6FT and over.... I was comfy.\n\nService can be spotty.  Servers can get preoccupied with shop talk, and they get distracted by other customers.  Otherwise, they were quite friendly, but hard to flag down.\n\nLooking forward to trying their lunch and dinner menu someday.  It looked pretty amazing.'

S'Never have I eaten at Grand Lux Cafe so many times in one weekend, but there\'s a reason why and it\'s because it\'s so good and convenient. We stayed at the Venetian hotel and this was the only place that was open 24/7 with great late night eats. The food court got tiring after so many visits. The menu is here is so extensive that you can try something new every time. We came in for lunch one day and many of us ordered their lunch special, such a great deal. For $10 bucks you can get a cup of soup, side salad, and half a sandwich. All my friends said they enjoyed what they ordered. I opted to pay $2 more for the side salad and half pasta combo. Even half of a regular pasta entr\xc3\xa9e was a lot for me to eat for lunch and I even had to take it to go. The Cabonara pasta is so tasty! Loaded with cream sauce, which I love, I hate dry pastas, it got a boost of flavor from the bits of bacon and green peas. Because it is Vegas, top off your meal with a cocktail! The Blood Orange Mojito is an excellent choice! The fries there are to die for. It seems so simple and so common a thing, but the fires there keep me coming back. Maybe there\'s a special oil that they cook them in because they have a richer and sweeter after taste. They\'re just ordinary fries, but dip it in a bit of ranch or ketchup and you\'ll be chomping away the whole plate of fries before you know it! Service here also never fails, always friendly and quick, despite it being super crowded all the time. I came back so many times the manager even remembered me. He called me "Sloppy Joe Girl" because one night I ordered it and he was happy I came back for more food. He even kept going back to the kitchen to check up on our take out order so we wouldn\'t be waiting so long. This makes up for the crappy cashier. He did however apologize to us and said that he was just having a bad day, but still, don\'t take it out on your customers, that\'s very unprofessional. One night we ordered a sloppy joe and the other night we ordered the chicken cream pasta with sun dried tomatoes for take out. The sloppy joe was nice and tangy with a sprinkle of chopped onions, so good! The meat was loaded with flavor, probably too salty alone, but when paired up with the long sandwich buns, it was a perfect balance. It also came with a side sauce of some orange tangy nature which I didn\'t care too much for. The chicken pasta was good, but probably not my favorite dish there so far. It didn\'t have as much cream sauce compared to the Cabonara that I liked and the grilled chicken was dry. It was a little hard to eat. It was a huge portion though, it fed like three of us girls! Till next time Grand Lux, I will be back for you!'

Definitely a great place for brunch, lunch, or at 4am when you\'re back from the clubs. This place only lost a couple brownie points because I ordered a Strawberry Bellini (which was on the menu) and they were out of them. I asked, "Are you out of the strawberries or the champagne?" and the waitress said they were out of the champagne! How could a restaurant in vegas not have champagne. So I was denied my brunch cocktail!\n\n If you\'re staying  at the hotel or even just passing through, you can count on this place to fill your belly before you head out to the casinos.'

As we were looking at the menu, one of us even commented on how Grand Lux seemed liked a Cheesecake copycat . . until we noticed the Cheesecake Factory screen saver on the cashier monitors and confirmed it with our server.\n\nStill, I'm not taking anything away from the quality of their food.  Just like CF, the food is high quality but like CF there's little regard for healthfulness of the preparation so I'm sure everyone of our dishes were close to 2,000 calories.\n\nGL is open 24 hours so a good option for late night munchies."

Both dishes were very good and well portioned. \n\nThe price was 15-20 for most things I would say which is pretty good for a pretty classy place on the strip.

S"Grand Lux Cafe isn't your typical cafe with the typical diner type items. It's actually a classier looking restaurant that has a huge resemblance to Cheesecake Factory. And after speaking to our waitress, we found out they had the same owner. The food is similar too but in my opinion, the quality is much much better here at the Grand Luxe. \n\nFor appetizers, the BF and I shared crabcakes which were sooo sooooooo goood! Loved the dipping sauce that came with it and the crabcake itself had perfect texture and flavor. Couldn't remember the cocktails we had but we loved them too - got us a pretty nice buzz going even before our main course.\n\nFor our main dish, I ordered the Miso Glazed Salmon and the BF had the Pasta with Chicken, Sun-Dried Tomato and Mushrooms tossed lightly in a garlic, creamy, parmesan cheese sauce. Both were superb in taste! \n\nBest part about this place? It opens 24 hours! Woooohoooo! Definitely a big plus when we stay at the Venetian! Helps with my usual late night munchies =)"

We were very happy with your kind wait staff and caring managers. The breakfast buffet was just what we needed and for $15 that was great! The late night, giant grilled cheese for $6 was out of this world. \n\nThe turkey club sandwhich was really terrible though, so thats the one thing I can say needs some work ont he menu. New bread, cut it smaller like a club and use a juicier thinner sliced turkey. \n\nHonestly thank you for being around and adding a good option to all the choices in Vegas.'

This is a sister restaurant to the cheesecake factory, so some of the menu items are the same. The decor looks almost exactly the same as the cheesecake restaurant as well. Very clean and quick service too. \n\nI always order the chicken pot pie. I always have to get this because it's really good! Lots of big chunks of chicken breast and veggies with a flaky pastry crust. There are also a variety of other things like pasta, burgers, salads, soups, sandwiches, etc. There's basically something for everyone. Portions here are huge, def. enough to share with someone. \n\nService here is great...esp the waiters at night. We had came back here after a night of drinking and the waiter was very patient with us and we were able to get some food in our tummys! Just a warning though, the late night menu is not the same full menu that they serve during the day time. Still plenty of delicious choices!"

At first, we were just going to order off the menu instead of going to the small buffet, but when you add your beverages, the price is virtually the same. The buffet includes your drinks and an orange juice was $5.95 so we decided to go with the buffet. Small but mighty, it did not disappoint! Made to order omelettes, incredible waffles, a big selection of fresh fruit and pastries, and 3 different kinds of hearty breakfast meat! It was seriously so good for standard breakfast food! Yes it was slightly pricey but it was more than average and great service!'

Delicious waffles and lightly breaded chicken.\nGreat salads at lunch and the crispy buffalo sandwich looked great as well as the fish and chips. \nDinner was so flavorful. We tried the chicken Revello and it was fantastic. Very good cocktails here, as well. You cannot go wrong with your dining here.

But based on their Sunday Night Pasta, I HAVE to give this restaurant 5 stars. It's amazing. The braised beef chunks are tender and tasty, the meat sauce is perfect (not too overwhelming), and the spaghetti noodles are nice and buttery. This dish is neither too heavy nor too light, and the portions are generous, enough for two people. I highly recommend this dish, and I would be willing to go back and try other things. Additionally, the prices are reasonable as compared to similar restaurants (the Sunday Night Pasta was $18)."

It was like 3 something in the morning, my brother had won some money so cheesecake was on him (w00000t). \n\nIf you're in Vegas and sick of Terrible's and buffet food, and want a good quality, not so expensive breakfast/lunch/dinner/late night snack, hit up the Grand Lux."

You have your burgers, breakfast, the classic BLT, desserts and cocktails. Everyone comes here after their clubbing or gambling. This one is located in the Venetian and is spacious and the people who work the graveyard shift are peppy and upbeat.\n\nWe had a breakfast sandwich that was delicious and was recommended by our server.

We ordered several drinks for the table and I can say without a doubt that their alcoholic mixed drinks are all delicious but the Limoncello Lemonade is sooo good!

I dunno.\n\nI will say that illness aside, still a great place to eat, the special was a salmon dish and the soup du jour was clam chowder (shou-deir) and that was rich and creamy. I also had the short ribs and those were really really good, only two ribs, but still tender and juicy. \n\nAnd also great service as usual. \n\nSo please just cause I dropped a star doesn't mean don't go back and enjoy a steak, because I might go back again later this week."

S"Located right in the casino at The Venetian, Grand Lux Cafe is easy to find. There are even signs posted directing you to the door. Once you are there, seating options are inside the restaurant or at one of the tables that is out in the casino. \n\nMy only complaint from the trip was what I imagine to be the only complaint I would ever have with the Grand Lux, the iced tea was not very good. My dissatisfaction goes no further. In fact, from there my satisfaction actually grows rapidly. \n\nI believe on the menu it is listed as Creamy Spinach and Cheese Dip...though more commonly Spinach and Artichoke dip...and it just might be the best I have ever had. The dip is served with plenty of tortilla chips, so you never have to worry about running out of things to dip, a problem I frequently encounter at other restaurants. \n\nIf you are familiar with the menus at The Cheesecake Factory, then you understand how overwhelmed you can feel at Grand Lux Cafe as well. So many items on the menu and they all sound good. There just aren't enough hours in the day for a menu like that, but you have to start somewhere.\n\nI ordered the Fried Chicken. The meal I anticipated, a breast/thigh/leg with a side of mashed potatoes, would have been right for how hungry I was. The meal I got, a veritable mountain of chicken strips with a side of mashed potatoes, was a bit more than I could handle. I think the chicken was like $13-14. You cannot beat that. \n\nGrand Lux has locations in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston and Chicago with two future locations of Garden City, NY and Sunrise, FL. At least in the cities where there are currently locations, there are so many restaurants and I always try to not go to the same place twice when I travel since there are so many options. I will have to fight to stick to that when I have the option to go back to Grand Lux Cafe. The place is even open 24 hours (in Las Vegas)!"

After returning to the room and talkin' it over, 2 of the 4 insisted that the Grand Lux at the Venetian would be the best...or supposedly so.\n\nMaking the trek to the Venetian, we walked in and from the outside, the restaurant looks decent...nice decor, ok setting (not too noisy from the casino area although very close by) and clean, we were seated by a friendly waiter.\n\nSurprisingly, the restaurant wasn't crowded even though we arrived shortly after noon time.  \n\nMoving on, we got to our table and the waiter handed us with our menus.  My friend asked how much the drinks from the bar would cost and he responded as anywhere between ($7~11)...fair enough...it's Vegas...you're gonna be charged quite a bit....\n\nThirty minutes down the line, we finally got our food....and unfortunately, not that impressive...would've gotten the same deal elsewhere at a much lower price.\n\nToward the end, the waiter wasn't very friendly with service.  \n\nOverall, I know that there are so many other places in Vegas to eat...buffet/upscale restaurants available, and I choose not to come back to this place ever.  It's too pricey, and the quality of the food isn't as impressive as first thoughts."

I frequently come here with my bf in the wee hours of the night (er... day?) and I always see large groups of over-clubbed 20-30somethings no matter what day! Oh wait, that's Vegas... ha!\n\nWell my favorite item on the menu so far is the Ahi Tuna Burger (not sure if that's the exact name, but it's the only Ahi Burger on there?) I get it just seared, and raw all throughout the center... THE TASTE IS JUST WONDERFUL! Cooked through, or not, I would still say the flavors that pull through it are amazing. Too bad they don't have any other sides besides fries you can get with it.\n\nI have also tried a few of their Asian-inspired dishes and have not been disappointed yet! \n\nIt's on the strip (boo!), but still worth going to if you're in the area.

S'Came here for a late breakfast/early lunch and was thoroughly impressed. This place is HUGE! So many cavernous twists and turns once you actually enter, so don\'t let any line outside discourage you.\n\nThey have a ~16 dollar breakfast buffet, filled with standards such as omelets, bagels, jams, breakfast meats, etc.., but I had the lunch offerings. The Modern Cuban sandwich looked appetizing, so I ordered it and GOOD LORD it was huge, just like everything else in Vegas, except me if you get my drift : ( . AND THAT WAS THE LUNCH PORTION!\nThe flavor was out of this world, too. Prosciutto, roast pork, Swiss cheese, and a sort of jalapeno mayo sauce made this sandwich delicious. My only complaint is that it was way too greasy, but luckily the flavor more than compensated. The fries served alongside it were pleasant as well - crispy and not too salty.\n\nMy girlfriend had the lunch portion of some sort of Asian-inspired salad, topped with crunchy noodles and peanuts. I must say, I am afraid to know how big the "dinner" portion is... The salad was fresh-tasting, probably owing to the cilantro, and had good textural contrasts between the soft leaves and the crunchy noodles and peanuts.\n\nAnother complaint besides overly-greasy sandwich is a general complaint I\'ve noticed of Vegas eateries: overpriced juice drinks. You can get a sandwich that will feed a multi-generational south Vietnamese family for a fortnight for less than a nice T-shirt, but a small glass of fresh-squeezed juice will run you almost $6. Oh well. \nFOOD\'S STILL GOOD GIT\'R DONE.'

There was at least 25-30 of us with one waiter. He was able to accomodate everyone without any hesitation and we didn't even have to wait that long for our food to come. \n\nTheir portions are HUGE.

Again, the food was very good, but the service was so-so. \n\nToday, we had breakfast from the buffet and it was very good. Again, the service was so-so, except for the persons working the buffet area. The guy making the omelets there was excellent.\n\nIt has not been terribly crowded on the times we've been there.

We got a seat right at one of the bar tables.  The place was great, clean, and had the feeling of a high quality brasserie, similar to Absinthe in San Francisco.  \n\nI got the burger with Avocado and roasted peppers...mayo on the side and no cheese.  I tell you, without the cheese you could really taste the quality of the beef and the spiciness of the peppers...and then the coolness and texture of the avocado.  The fries were good too, very good in fact, but I was interested in the burger.  It was a well made burger and a very happy surprise.  Prices were reasonable too, and the service was great!  Highly recommend!"

The food is good, expect to pay a bit more if you order a la cart.  Better to go for the breakfast buffet.  The pastries are delicious and the breakfast meals are batches cooked therefore it's fresh when it's replenished. Always a good thing.  One less star for the service category.  It's a hot or miss from my experience but overall a great choice for breakfast and lunch."

Portions are huge (a la Cheesecake Factory), but I think the taste is way better than CF. Everything is good. My fiance also loved the chicken and waffles last time he came. yum yum yum.

S"Grand Luxe's strategy seems to be to replace quality with portion sizes.  Everything here was mediocre.  Bread was dry and flavorless.  We shared a chicken pasta dish in a red sauce.  The pasta was surprisingly cooked to perfection.  Just to be overwhelmed by the sauce.  Oh, so close yet so far.  Shaking beef and caramel chicken combo was ok.  Chicken's taste was overwhelming and nothing special.  The beef was quite good but, in total contrast to everything else at this place, gave a tiny portion. My family loves this place so I will probably be back. Unfortunately."

S"I wanted to eat here during the summer but didn't have an opportunity.  So I jumped to eat hear the next time I came to Las Vegas.  Was here for lunch on a weekday between Christmas and New Years and was seated rather quickly near the bar area.  The waitress explained the offerings were large and there were lunch portions available.  I ordered the Strawberry lemonade and Hot Brown.  My friend ordered the Pasta Del Sol and a Spicy Bloody Mary.   For an appetizer we ordered the Fried Shrimp, Calamari, and Vegetables.\n\nDrinks came out and Strawberry lemonade came out a bit sweet and I had to water it down with some water.  The Bloody Mary tasted nice and spicy and no hint of booze!\n\nThe appetizer came out quick and it certainly was enough for 4 as an appetizer.  Eat this quick as it will get greasy towards the end.\n\nThe waitress checked up on us and said the mains should be ready and after a small delay they came out.\n\nMy Hot Brown which is an open faced turkey sandwich on thick toast with cheese sauce was larger than expected and served separately with a side of fries.    The sauce was very rich and was slathered over the entire plate.  I had to dig into the bread and fries to cut the richness of this cheesy sauce.\n\nI cannot comment on the Pasta as I only had a small bite.\n\nService was exceptional as the drinks and water were refilled well and the waitress even help box the rest of the uneaten Pasta Del Sol.  \n\nWhen asked for dessert, we declined, but the waitress did mention that they were open 24 hrs.\n\nThe group seated next to us ordered the lunch portions of salad and they certainly were sufficient for lunch.  I certainly would go for a lunch portion next time, if you aren't completely famished."

S'Grand Lux is located at The Venetian hotel and is open 24 hours!  it\'s obviously very convenient if you stay at the Venetian and also after a club, this is a great place to go.  Ok, I pretty much get the same thing when I come here - the Zen Noodles.  It\'s sort of like Pho, it\'s what I call "American Pho."  lol.  I also got the Duck Potstickers, which is really good!  Although, for the price of that appetizer, I wish we would\'ve gotten more than 5 pieces.  Another good thing is that this place has a wide selection on their menu.  Maybe one day I\'ll think of getting something else rather than my noodles! ;)'

If I\'d of been able to actually eat my food ,I\'d of probably of thrown up!\n\nI wish I could still love this place but I can\'t anymore.'

That being said the quality is the same. Your pretty much paying for the ambiance. \n\nCame here around 3:30 in the morning. Had a terrible server. She look like she didn't want to be there. Never introduce herself and didn't refill our water glasses. The manager i believe at that time came by however often to check up on us told her to refill our water glasses but still nothing. \n\nFood Ordered:\nRib Eye Steak- Close to $30\nTerrible piece of steak. Told them medium rare but it came out medium well. I've had better steak at even Norms for goodness sake. The sides was nothing to write home about either. \n\nProbably won't ever eat here again.

S'After a night out at Tao, my party split. Some were too drunk to continue the night, while others (including myself) held it together and carried on! I had the pleasure of staying at The Venetian, so we thought... Why go out to The Strip where it\'s incredibly hot? So we started looking... \n\nI\'m not a big fan of going to sit-down places in Vegas; I really don\'t see the point. But the food court only had two places open - none of which seemed appealing. Luckily, a worker of the Venetian walked by us, so I (probably drunkly) walked up to her and asked if there were any other places that we could eat. She was really nice, pointed at Grand Lux, and said, "It\'s REALLY good." I was sold. \n\nWe walk in (party of four) and are immediately seated. Our server is VERY nice and attentive - and please keep in mind this was around 3 am - so I really doubt he wanted to be there. I forgot his name, but the guy was awesome. \n\nOnto food: We ordered the BLT sandwich, someone else ordered a burger, and per the servers recommendation, someone ordered Asian nachos (AMAZING, btw). I ordered the Bacon-Cheese burger(!!!!!). \n\nThe Asian nachos were freaking amazing... They\'re made with crispy friend wontons, covered with chicken, sweet peanut sauce, and wasabi cream and melted cheese! The plate comes with about ten of them, and we were all able to get one and enjoy it. It\'s just crispy goodness! Very yummy. \n\nMy Bacon-Cheese burger was freaking good. I just reviewed GR\'s BurGR, and I was really unimpressed with the service and food. My burger was a disappointment. Luckily, I had come to the GLC the night before, so this burger was still on my mind. I ordered it well done, and it was made perfectly. It\'s ANGUS beef with crispy bacon, melted American cheese, grilled onions, and mayo. I really recommend it! I was starving, and yet, I couldn\'t even finish it. It was huge! The fries that it came with were meh, but nothing a little ranch can\'t fix. \n\nOverall, I can recommend this place for lunch or at least for the Asian nachos and burger that I ordered. The service was GREAT, but the time it took to get our food was a bit long... No matter. He kept checking on us, and made sure that our drinks were filled. That alone is good enough for me.'

S"I've been traveling to LV with the same group of guys a couple times each year for the last 10 years or so. The last five we almost always stay at the Venetian and the Grand Lux Cafe has become our favorite place to eat.\n\nMind you, we in no way ignore all the great steak house near the strip or in downtown, but for some reason we love this place. On one 3-day trip, we ate their six times. One day, we ate every meal there!\n\nWhat amkes this place so great? Its variety and the quality of the food. But there's a clincher for us. We always choose to dine in the patio area that overlooks the pathway between the casino and the elevators to the rooms and the stairways from the ballrooms because all the pretty gals in their evening dresses walk by past us. Good food, good friends and lovely ladies. What else could you ask for?!\n\nRegarding the food, GLC makes great burgers, awesome pasta and delicious NY cheesecake. One of my friends loves the jambalaya and another likes the orange chicken. Breakfasts are good as well, and their salads are tasty and bountiful. The iced teas are enormous. They taste unlike any other iced tea I've had and at first I didn't like them, but they've grown on me.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and obviously have eaten all the dishes because they never lack for enthusiastic recommendations when we ask.\n\nThe portions are quite large, maybe not Claim Jumpers huge, but still big enough to illicit groans from some in our group that they need to go up to the room and lie down. It's also a good thing the restrooms are directly across from the the restaurant. If you need to make room for desert you can just hop the fence and be back right as it's being served.\n\nIf you ever stay at the Venetian give Grand Lux a try. Sometimes the lines are long, but they move pretty quickly. Sit in the patio, relax and enjoy the scenery."

At the recommendation of a friend, we had the Buffalo Egg Rolls...which are awesome. Buffalo chicken fried in to an egg roll and served with bleu cheese dressing? Yes, please.\n\nAfter that, I had a kind of tropical salad, which was good, but not great. The chicken was kind of tasteless, needed a little seasoning, and the dressing was way too sweet. It was served with a nice mix of lettuce, jicama, bell peppers, sweet peas, and other veggies, but it didn't need to be drowned in all that sweet dressing. The fried flour tortilla chips served on the side were drenched in the stuff, which made them like eating sopapillas.\n\nPrice was...not appalling for being inside a casino, and service was friendly.

I have eaten at Lux before and liked what I ordered the last time we were here but this time I was just kinda meh. The Lettuce wraps were just ok, the filling was a bit too salty. The fried calamari was ok, it also had shrimp in it, I thought it was decent but I know it didn't sit well with my GF. Within 30 minutes after we left, my GF had to make a deposit at the Wynn and it was not a cash deposit. We think it might have been the dipping sauce.

S'We came here for a quick dinner before heading out for the night. Since we were staying at the Venetian, we decided to just keep it simple and eat close by. Luckily, there was not a long wait for a party of 6.\n\nLet me just put it out now. RUDE SERVICE!\nI don\'t care if it\'s Vegas or not vegas, if you\'re a server, you should have a good attitude no matter what restaurant or location you\'re at. Our server, I shall leave his name out of this review, was rude the moment he came to our table and asked for drinks. We had already been drinking all day at the pool and all we wanted were waters. He gave us this look of disgust and made a comment along the lines of just waters?... And just kind of walked away to let us look over the menus. It would have been nice too to introduce yourself too, sir.\n\nFinally when he came back to take our orders, I asked him if they put the ranch on the side or on the Buffalo Wings appetizer dish and he looked at me as if I were asking a stupid question. His reply was "So you want it on the side...? Or just extra on the side...?" I then had to explain to him to leave the ranch on the side because I was allergic to dairy and eggs. He then straight up said "Well then you can\'t have them!! It has all of those in it" in a tone of voice assuming I\'m supposed to know this?! Forget it then. We ended up ordering the Chicken Lettuce Wraps for an appetizer and when it came to entrees, I ordered the Clams with Pasta dish. I asked him what kind of noodles they used and he said, "Egg noodles. You can\'t have that either!" I asked if they could substitute the noodles for non-egg noodles and he started listing off random noodles I barely recognized by name. I guess I had a confused look on my face because he just sighed and asked if I just wanted rice noodles instead. Done. Oh, and by the way, throughout this whole conversation over food allergies, this guy has the nerve to laugh and joke about it....\n\nFood comes out, he doesn\'t even come back to check on us until after we\'re almost done and it\'s only to ask if we wanted boxes. Honestly, this place is open 24/7 and I know for sure I would come back here after a night of drinking, but if all the servers here had this guys attitude, I would rather go to Denny\'s. Looking at the other reviews, it seemed like our table just got bad luck and got this horrible server. Overall, the food is pretty good with big portions. I would probably compare this place to a Cheesecake Factory with a Maggiano\'s ambiance.'

S"You're in vegas. Wants to dine-in yet there is no time to go to a buffet, but refuses to go to a fast food joint? Grand Lux is the answer. \n \nI think this is better than cheesecake factory. Despite the same ambiance, interior decoration, to-go bag color schemes, and menus, the food was a bit more tasteful than cheesecake factory.  \n \nI ordered the pork chops and I was very satisfied with my choice. When there is a mixture of apples with pork chops and mash potatoes and brussel sprouts- I'm in! The pork chops was perfect- not over cooked, not under cooked near the bone. I enjoyed every morsel that was left to the bone. My friends had a bite of my dish and agreed that they liked my dish.   \n\nThe service was tentative. They were concerned with our experience which is surprising for our group of 13. Other places tend to neglect you knowing that they have a guaranteed 18-20% tip.

Some of my favorites:  spicy calamari salad, shrimp scampi, miso glazed salmon, and caramel chicken.  Desserts are great too - can't go wrong with a batch of freshly baked chocolate chip cookies or the beignets with 3 sauces.  It's definitely worth the money."

Luckily someone pointed us to this place and it was a delight.  I had the Veggie burger here and it was delish.  Other items ordered were the philly cheese steak bacon burger, which my friend gobbled down w/o the veggie trimmings of course), and a chicken parmsean.  I dont eat meat, but I've never seen a chicken breast that massive ever before.  It was huge!  My friend loved it but it could've easily been shared between 5 people."

They told me "We will hold your reservation for 5 minutes" which I thought was pretty rude, but when I got there they didnt even have my reservation in the system!

S'Been here a couple of times before. I\'ve never been disappointed by the food that comes out of the kitchen, the service, or the view (last time here, saw Lebron James, Donyell Marshall and their posse). This appears to be one of the favorites of my close buddy and his family as well.\n\nThe Venetian hotel is known for it\'s 5 star service and decor, that of classic elegance. The name itself evokes thoughts of royalty and class. The restaurant almost always has a line, especially at night as this is one of the few restaurants open late night with a full palatable menu.\n\nEnvironment: the restaurant had the main dining hall, a couple side sections and the "outdoor" patio. All are very open with high ceilings so that you never feel crowded. Given that this is in the middle of one of the more popular hotels in Vegas, ambient noise is a given. We happened to sit on the patio which is still inside the hotel but enclosed by a 3 foot high antique gate. Perfect for people-watching especially because you have a great view of the hallway leading to Tao nightclub. The tables are a little too closely situated together (I coupe clearly hear the conversation of our neighbors) but you\'re never hitting elbows. If you\'re a larger person, request the booth seating because the chairs are designed for people with a BMI of 25 or less.\n\nWaiter/waitresses: she made several trips to our table to make sure we were enjoying our dinner. Every time she came by, she had a smile on her face. Our water cups never went empty nor did our bread basket. Overall, impressive service and something you\'d expect at a more intimate 4-star restaurant.\n\nFood: I just learned that this restaurant is owned by Cheesecake Factory. That explains the decor, bread, an much of the menu. The bread basket contains freshly baked honey wheat and sourdough. The crust is crunchy and flaky while the middle of the loaf is soft and chewy, the perfect consistency for bread. The honey aspect of the wheat bread is not overpowering but adds jut a hint of sweetness to enhance your appetite and clear your palate for the entree. For the main course I had the crispy caramel chicken. Basically, it\'s fancy orange chicken which is served with a medley of vegetables marinated in the sweet and spicy thai sauce covering the chicken as well ad a generous helping of either brown or white rice. The chicken\'s crust was a little thick, making it difficult to chew. The chicken itself was on the drier side and the sauce a little too sweet. In fact, the dish was more sweet than spicy. If that suits your taste, you may want to check this dish out.\n\nDrinks: just water.\n\nRecommendation: EAT!!!'

This means we waited about half an hour for our food.\n\nBut we were hungry at 4am. \n\nThe burger my friend had boasted a patty that was an inch thick. At least. Another friend ordered a shrimp scampi with scarily large shrimp and my omelet had a 10-inch diameter...and we ate it all.\n\nDelicious but the wait during such a crucial time of need resulted in the docking off of 2 stars. Oh and it's pretty expensive for drunk munchies. \n\nPro tip: The premade sandwiches are freaking DELICIOUS and only about $7, which is the best deal on their menu."

S"Stayed at Venetian for Labor Day weekend and for 2 nights, we had dinner here.  The portions are huge and the prices are fair, if not bordering on affordable.  A big juicy burger (chop house or mushroom) weighs in at about 1/3 lb with a huge serving of fries on the side for only about $13!!!!  The grilled chicken avocado salad is fresh and delicious, the portion serves 2 people (one if you're ravenous and will fill you to the brim!) for $14.  The Manhattan salad with the option of vegetables and cheese (other options include, chicken, shrimp, and price varies accordingly) rang in about $14.  They don't skimp on the cheese or beans or dressing either!  I eat a lot and the salads were filling!  Complimentary sourdough and butter came with the salads.  I think I got about 3 to 4 large slices of sourdough per salad.  How generous is that for a $14 meal?  Dinner for 2 cost under $35!  Much cheaper and fresher than other expensive places in Vegas.  After spending lots of money at a mediocre buffet (Bacchanal to be exact) with below par quality, this place was a delight!  Fresh quality with large portions at affordable prices is like a dream!  Presentation is worthy of any fine dining (maybe I exaggerate here, haha).  This place is open 24 hours too!"

This time around the food selection is not as large at night, which was expected but the food was not outstanding.  I would normally expect the opposite since it normally seems that food is that much better after you've been drinking all night long.  Fries were, chewy, not sure if that is the right word but definitely looked like they just came right out of the fryer.  So maybe old, not sure.  Burgers were good but once again nothing special.

Third, service was a little blah because I had to stand around for about 2 minutes before some gave me change. It wasn't like they were super busy because they had plenty of time to tell me that I couldn't sit in one of the chairs by the cash register.

In the weeks leading up to this last Vegas trip, all I heard about was how I had to try the Frozen Hot Chocolate because it was sooooo amazing. But having now tried it, for the price, way not worth it - it\'s icy and too powder-y tasting. I would much rather have a chocolate frosty from Wendy\'s, that\'s much more like frozen hot chocolate, and doesn\'t cost $10+ dollars.\n\nI would say skip this place.

The entire dish was a great pick considering what I had the night before. \n\nWe went here our last trip in April, and they were having some anniversary special, so that when you purchase their nachos, any refill of it would only be a dollar! So obviously we stocked up on those...though I'm not too sure how much we should've ate since most of us couldn't finish our main dish.\n\nGreat place, great service.

If you want pizza then go to Spago.  If you want Southwestern food then go to Mesa Grill.  If you want a burger then go to Mesa Grill, Bobby's Burger Palace, or Fat Burger.\n\nBUT!  If you want something sweet stop here.  Try and sit outside as well because it is extremely loud inside.  Also...count how many low riders and hydraulic cars you see.  For some reason they always start their southern migration when I visit Serendipity.

I got the chicken and waffles and OH MY GOD they were amazing!! \n\nNow the only thing keeping me from giving  this place a 100%  positive review was the wait time on the food. There was a big party next to us that was sat much later than we were and they received their food about ten minutes or more before us. James apologized for the wait and proceeded to be very attentive, so we knew it wasn't his fault. At the end of the meal I asked for the manager so I could tell her how great James was even with the long wait for our food. She did not apologize for the long wait and said they don't usually get big parties at brunch time. Seriously?! It was a blonde lady. And as she was leaving our table she made the rudest face I've ever seen a manager make! She acted as if I had wasted her time. My whole table caught it and was completely dumbfounded by her rudeness. It was like she didn't even care!

I just wanted a simple root beer float, but when my wife's hot chocolate ice cream came out, I couldn't keep my spoon out.  Holy molee that was delicious.  It was in a huge wide glass bowl with a three layer piece of chocolate cake with whipped cream on top of vanilla and chocolate ice cream swimming in hot chocolate.  I think the description speaks for it's self.  We hammered at this euphoric dish, and still left over half of it in the bowl.  YUMMY!!!!\n\nThe miniature tacos and piled high burgers looked incredible as well.  Sometimes you can just tell by looking at a dish that it is going to taste good.  Very pricey, but this is Vegas.  I would say the prices were very well stated as compared to anywhere else in Las Vegas.  However, there is a Sundae listed on the menu for $1000.  I did not see anyone order it, but if it didn't come with some kind of quality gold jewelry, I don't see how it could be worth it. \n\nI had to knock a star off for the 15 min wait and semi slow service.  It is a Sunday, and it did appear that no real management or leadership was in place.  I saw a lot of servers standing around waiting for something to do.  Meanwhile, four young girls stood behind the counter just chitchatting while half of the restaurant was empty.  It didn't make sense that people had to wait so long to be seated.  Additionally, when new customers came in, they didn't know they were supposed to check in and proceeded to an empty table.  Then someone would finally tell them they had to wait, which made everyone confused Becsuse of the open tables and lack of professionalism behind the check in counter."

S'Heard about the frozen hot chocolate and grilled cheese from a friend, so I decided to give this place a try with 5 other people.  Arrived around 12:30 and put our names down and got one of those little buzzer things that lets you know when your table is ready.  We got some snacks at the to-go window to hold us over for the 45 minute wait and sat near the bar.\n\nThe buzzer makes a beeping noise 20 minutes in, so one of us walks up to the hostess and she looks at him like he\'s crazy and tells him to go sit back down cause our table isn\'t ready. We wait, we wait, we wait we wait....well over the 45 minutes we were initially told (with no beep from our buzzer thingy) and another one of us heads up to the hostess only to be informed that we were marked as "no show" and they\'ve gone 3 or 4 people past on the waiting list.  Promises of a table in 20 minutes are made, we all gather and gang up and the wait drops to 5 minutes.  \n\nOur server was super busy, so she wasn\'t especially attentive to our table.  Things were forgotten, checking in was infrequent, it was hard to flag her down if we needed something...we also wanted to order off the lunch menu, but brunch doesn\'t end until 2pm...so we wait some more...since it was 1:40 by the time we were seated.\n\nFood finally arrived, and for the price it was terrible.  There\'s not much to say...the portions were huge, but what\'s the point if it doesn\'t taste good?? Fried chicken was soggy, the grilled cheese was also soggy and kind of weird tasting and the frozen hot chocolate, although presented nicely, contained more whip than chocolate and turned watery pretty quick.  The reuben was meh...but if the best thing on the table is only a mediocre tasting reuben that cost $15...well...it\'s infuriating.\n\nLas Vegas is filled with restaurants that are, without much effort, better than this place.  Go somewhere else when you\'re in town unless you\'re completely drunk (e.g. you don\'t care if your food is kinda gross) and you just won some money in the casino to waste on this place.'

S'Any girl obsessed with love story movie themes and one who watched Serendipity had to check this place out on a recent visit to Las Vegas. Well this girl was me and I left pretty let down. The speciality item is the frozen hot chocolate and a "must have" so of course that is what I had. Service inside the restaurant caters to those eating meals so they pretty much ignore you if all you want is a drink. Finally someone told me to go to the outside walk-up window where they provide take out and make the drinks. I pretty much could have stood there all day long as no one took the time to acknowledge me until at least a good ten minutes. Clearly lacking in customer service skills people. Anyhow I lined up outside in the heat and ordered a ten dollar frozen hot chocolate. It basically was a malted style drink with lots of whipped cream. A frappacino has more flavour. It hit the spot cuz it was so hot and I was sweating up a storm but meh not so good. Overpriced and clearly overhyped!!!'

S'This place has awesome desserts, but the service is lacking. It\'s a tiny place so our wait for a table indoors (who wants to be outside eating ice cream when it\'s 105+??) for 4 people was over 30 minutes. i\'m glad we did wait because the sundaes were amazing! i got the black & white sundae, way too big for 2 people even! we could only eat about half. The hostess was rude, and annoyed that we were waiting inside for our name to be called. The server didn\'t really check on us at all, just the 1st "what would you like" then the "here\'s your food, enjoy" maybe they have too many tables, TDK. \n\nOverall, cute place to stop in for dessert with a group.'

S"Ok i'll make a confession, the only reason I've heard of or even cared about Serendipity was because I find Kate Beckinsale hot and want to make her my movie star wife...\n\n\nIn all seriousness, places that have the reputation of being a cute, girly, dessert oriented place don't make it high on my priority list and I usually need someone of the female persuasion to convince me to go.  But when my friend and his GF suggested we meet up there for lunch, I thought, 'sure why not' after hearing their food menu is actually quite good.\n\nSo cut to a sunny Sat afternoon in front to Caesars Palace and we had to wait about 30 min for our table to open up, chilling (literally) in the mist enhanced sunshade tent which was a nice service to offer.  For those who didn't want to wait for a table there is an outdoor 'to go' window althought I suspect some of them had to wait almost as long for their food, and by that time their frozen hot chocolates were probably halfway melted (more on that later).\n\nWhat can I say, aside from the glaringly obvious presence of a fully lit LA style martini bar in the corner of the dining area (for the men who are desperately trying to salvage the last shreds of their masculinity) with sports on the plasma tvs, the decor is as cute and pink as one would expect.  And the dining crowd by my visual estimate was at least 70-80% female, complete with GFs, wives, kids, grandmas, all in all and very kid friendly place.\n\nAll 3 of us decided to go for their brunch menu items, altho the burgers and other non breakfast items looked equally mouth watering, but I wanted to save my stomach for another burger place.  I opted for the Hangover's Omelette which was a light and fluffy yet massive mega-omelette complete with cheese, sausage, bacon and french fries INSIDE the egg wrap.  Other items on the table included eggs benedict which I thought was quite good and the monster sized 'french toast log' complete with breakfast potatos, ice cream, fruit and bacon on the side.  The log was big enough to feed all of us, to be honest.\n\nNow the frozen hot chocolate, yes I've heard all about it and no, I never paid attn to the yelp photos.  I was expecting something the size of a Starbucks frappucino but my god this was huge.  They come in 2 sizes and while my friends got the classic hot choc, I wanted to try the white chocolate version to change things up.  Coming in 2 sizes I wisely chose the 'one man' size and when I got it....it looked no smaller than the portion for 2, and while normally I wouldn't complain about getting more for my money, this was too much for me and I couldnt even finish what I took to go.  Honestly, there should be a 'baby bear' size to go with the momma and poppa bear sizes.  I know I'm in the minority in this, but that's ok.\n\nFor those who try to get into the famed flagship NY store with their supposed 3 hr waits, you honestly might save a little time flying into vegas hop over to the Vegas one and fly back.  No i'm not serious but if you happen to be in LV, definitely try it out."

We only had dessert here, but given how impressed we were with that aspect of this place, we will probably make it a point to come back here to try the rest of their menu.\n\nAs others have said, it's probably best to order at the window.

S"One of the main reasons I wanted to try Serendipity was for their cold hot chocolate. I have to say that I was a little disappointed. I thought that it would be tastier than it was, but I felt like it was something that I would be able to make myself. In addition, it was a bit on the pricey side. The food that I ordered the Fully Monty Sandwich (I believe that's what it's called) which was realllyy goood. The proportions were really large as well, so I had enough for two meals. My order also came with the option of sweet potato fries or steak fries. My sweet potato fries were nothing out of the ordinary, but my friend's steak fries were pretty tasty. The inside of the restaurant is very nicely decorated.\n\nSome of the downsides are that the prices are a bit expensive, especially for the cold hot chocolate. Also, while I was there with my friends the waiter was not very professional, and would say inappropriate to my friends and I while we were eating and ordering."

S"Colorful, one-of-a-kind dining is an exact description of Serendipity.\n\nThey serve brunch, lunch, and dinner. They have a variety of foods that range from spaghetti and meatballs to barbecued pork ribs. They are very popular for their humungous desserts. I have tried their classic sundaes, deep fried oreos, and their very popular frrrozen hot chocolate. Yes, frozen and hot. I know...it's a paradox, but you just have to try it to understand it. It's a very interesting drink that tastes like cocoa in hot chocolate, but it's cold and consistent to a strawberry daiquiri. Very unique, indeed. \n\nI haven't figured out a good time to come here without having to wait over 30 minutes for a table. If you're in a hurry, they have this grab-n-go service, which is on the side of the restaurant. There is a smaller menu of their most popular items for take-out.\n\nI am a sucker for sweets and Serendipity has established it's own little place in my heart; especially when one of my all-time favorite movies is Serendipity!"

S"I visited the original Serendipity in NYC years ago and instantly became a fan after trying their famous frozen hot chocolate. So, on a recent trip to Vegas my husband and I decided to have breakfast here. WOW! What a great decision. I had the saints n sinners french toast log and my husband ordered the New York strip steak breakfast sandwich. Once we placed our order, our food arrived quickly and we dug right in. Both dishes were delicious and HUGE!  The savory side of the french toast was my favorite but the sweet side was good as well. I must say that the steak sandwich was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever tasted, so I was happy to oblige when my husband suggested we share. By the end of our meal we were both stuffed, satisfied and ready for the rest of our day. We will definitely be visiting Serendipity 3 next time we are in Vegas."

I've been there twice within the week  - my family and friends ordered the omelet (huge), turkey sand ( it was open faced), mac and chz pizza, margarita pizza, chicken appetizer, chicken cesear salad, and of course the yummy frozen hot chocolates and a blackout cake sundae.  You can skip the blackout cake it it super duper duper chocolately... I like chocolate and I could only eat one bite.  IT's like a chocolate cake and ganache in between.  Downfalls: pricey (paying for the name) and slow service (although there isn't a line like NY but still once you get in you should have to wait forever - we waited nearly 30 minutes to get our food after ordering)"

For a party of 6, we ordered 1 frozen hot chocolate & 1 peanut butter frozen hot chocolate. Each were around $10-$14? I don't remember the exact amount. But 2 drinks between our party, no one finished any of it. It's good, for the first 4 sips, but then its so rich, that you can't drink too much of it.

They were lightly battered with tempura and they were moist and came with about 5 dipping sauces.  I had the white pizza - great!  My boyfriend had the bbq cheeseburger - he said it was very good.  So big he couldn't finish, perhaps having the frozen hot chocolate and chicken strips first, filled us.  I would definitely go back for the food, it was delish!

S"I have no idea what the savory items taste like at this place, but I love the desserts.  When my family came to Las Vegas last summer we came here three times in the course of a week.  I love all of the sundaes and the deep fried oreos are the bomb diggity.  I'd say if you want to try something besides the frozen hot chocolate get the deep fried oreo sundae.  The frozen hot chocolate is also awesome.  Both times I had it I shared with my boyfriend, but I could've had it all to myself and I'm talking about the double portion.  I'd say it's a little small, but I love shake-like confections.  I think no matter what time I come here I'll always get dessert and not something else, because when I think about Serendipity 3 I think about dessert.  In that respect my review is a little biased for just desserts.  That's all I've had.  I've been trying to coax my university friends to come here instead of going to happy hour. It's that good. :D"

They get away with overcharging on this garbage made from cheap ingredients.  As well, the interior decorating and ambience was a disappointment too, certainly far from any "Vegas" standard.  \n\nYou\'d be much happier and satisfied by going to Dairy Queen for dessert.'

We were seated by a heat lamp, which was also a plus because it wasn't exactly super warm outside. There were, however, these crazy birds swooping around the tables. There's gotta be something unsanitary about that, right? Some sort of health code violation? Not sure how to prevent that, maybe just better cleanup of the food that dumb children (or dumb adults, let's be honest) might have thrown on the ground for them.\n\nAs for the food, it is hard to find anything on the menu under 12 bucks. Even appetizers. I opted for the 16 dollar burger which was cooked exactly the way I wanted it, medium rare (plus!). While both burger and fries were good, they were not worth 16 bucks and were certainly not anything I would rave about. Dessert = also expensive. My boyfriend and I split a simple sundae with butterscotch and hot fudge. Tasty...but not 13-14 dollar tasty.\n\nI don't feel the need to ever come back here, honestly.

I was really hoping that I would be able to find at the very least two or three different options what I found was a scoop of sorbet was my only option. Even though I was kind of heart broken that I couldn't fully experience this cute little place, I went ahead and ordered my sorbet ... Well, my waitress forgot to bring it out. She brought out everyones food ( which I couldn't order anything) and then when she brought out dessert mine was missing. By the time she came back my friends were done with their meals and desserts that I had to tell her to forget about it. The place is really cute, the view of the strip is nice ( outside patio) but the service wasn't great and their aren't really options for us Gluten free and Vegan people. Want to go for the decor?

S'Lets start with the "ambiance". I would imagine dining on the outdoor patio as the weather continues to improve would make your dining experience here at Serendipity much more enjoyable. Alas, my dining experience(s) have been indoors. \n\nThe restaurant is centrally located on the infamous LVBLVD, and by central I mean central for passing tourists, not for those who have made a special trip just to dine at this fine establishment. You must park at Cesar\'s Palace, pack a canteen, and hike to your dining destination. WEAR COMFY SHOES! \n\nOnce you arrive (and find the front door, or side door, or??) you are dumped into the middle of the "dining commons" as I like to think of it. It reminds me of a lunch room cafeteria minus the buffet style and mean lunch ladies. \n\nOK, so this place isn\'t all bad, I promise. The staff has been generally friendly and I\'ll get to the food in a minute... \n\nIt\'s been a minute..If you can get past the wacky setup (and the fact you have to walk outside, around the building and through a deserted hallway to use the restroom), you have your pick of enormous eats on this joint\'s menu! \n\nTHE NACHOS ARE OUTSTANDING! I did venture away from my nacho comfort zone and ordered the BBQ Chicken pizza but...stick to CPK for that little diddy. The pizza was ALL crust, little cheese & toppings..nuff said. \n\nDesert. If you are looking to live on the edge and you want to partake in a desert for dinner evening, this would be your place! DELICIOUS, FATTENING, and FANTASTIC!!! \n\nSo, I give this place 3 stars mainly for their bangin nachos, and decent staff, but it loses the last two stars for layout, location, and well, everything except the food, drinks and staff, haha!'

Fortunately, the hostess was awesome enough to help me throughout the rest of my meal. The food was taking a bit longer than expected so she was the one that checked on the progress of the food, packed up my doggy bag after I was done, and closed out my check. She is probably the only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars.\n\nFood: I ordered a steak sandwich. The steak was waaayyyy too tough to even bite through. Took me MINUTES to get chew one bite of it.

I love how Caesar\'s called it "the legendary favorite." Barney Stinson would not agree.  Its a bowl of chilled hot chocolate with a TON of whip cream on top and sprinkled with flakes of chocolate. That honestly describes it. Nothing special about it except for its height and price tag. Its $11 for a small and $15 for a large "for two to share". And FYI the large is perfect for three people, especially if your eating a meal here.\n\nPesto Italian Pizza has a wonderful crispy crust, but it really lacked flavor. I\'m assuming if pesto is part of the title then it would at least taste like pesto, but oh was I wrong.\n\nIn and out does better burgers. Sorry, but I had to say it. Although you get a thick cut of beef patty, someone needs to tell them that quantity does not beat quality. The bread tasted old and it was soggy. My friend ended up eating it as an open face sandwich. The fries, on the other hand, was delicious. It was crispy and had a perfect golden yellow hue.\n\nThe hot dog was just....a hot dog.\n\nWarning!! The bathroom is quite a distance away. You have to walk outside to get to it.

S"i have never been this disappointed with my meal my entire life!\n\nmy mom came to las vegas for vacation & we walked around the caesar's palace to shop. i decided to take my mom in this place because as of my previous experience here, i was able to enjoy their desserts (although a little pricey) & pizza.. first, they had us wait for 15mins to be seated, even if i saw a lot of empty tables around, still i kept my cool down. then, we ordered a steak, to be cooked medium, and a frozen hot chocolate. for that 2 meals it took them 45mins to serve us food!!! we were so hungry & the server was apologetic enough to convince me to wait. \n\nthen when the steak came out it was so stiff and cooked well-done, blunt flavored! it's like someone just decided to throw a steak in a grill, left it there for 30mins and tossed-served it to us!!!\ni will never go back here again!!! save your money"

S"We came to Serendipity to get some hangover relief and one final epic meal before leaving Vegas. To this day, I'm still a bit puzzled why this place is so raved about...\n\nOn a typical summer Sunday, your wait will be pretty long for a large group. The restaurant itself is fairly small in Vegas standards, so be prepared. We were seated on the outside patio, because that's the only place that could accommodate a group of 12. Even though it was in the shade, it was HOT. Blazing Vegas hot. For some odd reason, the mist fans don't come on until noon, so we were left there sitting for an hour without any relief but our water. It's really not that hard to turn off the timers, guys...\n\nThe meal itself was nothing special. I ordered the Fried Chicken & Waffles, which came with 2 drumsticks, 2 thighs, one bacon waffle, potatoes, honey mustard and ketchup. The chicken was heavily breaded and was pretty dried out and flavorless. The only thing that added taste to it was the honey mustard. The bacon waffles were alright initially, but they get pretty unbearable after 1/4 of a waffle. The entire dish is just bland and flavorless. I understand they're trying to be unique here with the bacon waffles, but it's definitely not worth $22. \n\nFor the finale, all of us got the famed highly spoken of frozen hot chocolate. This was the biggest disappointment of the day. For $11, you're basically paying for a huge watered down chocolate milk with some whipped cream on top. That's exactly how it tastes. I experienced no wow factor and I seriously don't see what all the hype is about. It cools you down, but other than that, it's not that great."

S"My girlfriend has been asking to go here, so we decided to go before going to a show on 1/8/11.  It was a chilly night so the inside was busy, but the outside was pretty open, so we decided to ask for outside seating (there were heaters to make it doable).  We were seated pretty quickly which was nice, but that was the only nice thing.  After being seated, a server never even came to our table to ask if we wanted drinks.  We sat there for 30 minutes waiting without even getting acknowledged by the two waiters working the area even when we tried to get their attention.  3 groups were seated after us and received service.  I could understand if it was busy and they didn't have enough staff to cover the outside, but from the looks of it, the 2 servers outside were just plain pissed off about something and it wasn't that busy.  30 minutes is an inexcusable amount of time to wait to even have a server take a drink order.\n\nIt's too bad because the food sounded good."

S"Ever since I watched the movie, I've wanted to try this place. Frozen hot chocolate anyone? \n\nSince I wasn't able to go to the location in New York, I figured I would just go in Vegas. First time I went on Christmas, for lunch, I went myself and sat at the bar (since the wait was about 30 minutes for a table). I ordered myself a frozen hot chocolate and a side of sweet potato fries. The frozen hot chocolate is HUGE. The size for one is plenty for a table. The bar is a great place to eat if all your people are over 21 and there are seats there. The frozen hot chocolate itself \n\nThe second time I went with the kids on the trip to vegas (4 of them between 16 and 18). I reserved a table for all of us, but we were able to be seated quite quickly. At around 10, there aren't as many people in the restaurant. The service, though, once seated was a little spotty. It took a while to get someone to take our order..and then get the food. \n\nThe smores hot chocolate (which is what one of the girls got) looked good, but they forgot the graham crackers and didn't bring them until we asked for them. Also the hot chocolate had a huge mound of marshmallows so if you dont like those - don't get it. \n\nMy brother ended up getting the Oreo version of the frozen hot chocolate which tasted like oreo hot chocolate but cold. This second time I ordered the Forbidden Broadway Sundae (chocolate blackout cake, chocolate and vanilla ice creams, and a shit ton of whipped cream). So delicious, but halfway in, I was so full, I couldn't take another bite. The cake wasn't bad, but it wasn't the best I've ever had. \n\nOverall, big portions. Decent desserts. Always make a reservation and you'll be fine. Or sit at the bar. Service will be spotty, but you'll just have to deal with it."

S'THANK GOODNESS I LOVE Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack in the movie, Serendipity, enough to want to experience this restaurant - even if it\'s not the one in NY.\n\nLocation? LOVE. Although it\'s right outside of Caesar\'s Palace and all by itself.\n\nAs far as the SERVICE?  Fail, FAIL, fail, fail - what a joke.  You have got to be kidding me.  No one knows WTF they\'re doing there or their purpose of working at that place is, everyone is completely disheveled and unorganized and probably high off of something.\n\nPrices? EHH, not so much worth it. I\'d rather eat a full meal (which I did beforehand) than spend way too much money for average food there.\n\nI went there with 3 other people to get a taste of their frozen hot chocolate (I\'ve heard wonders about it) and thank god that made up for the terrible service we received.  I\'ve read on here that the wait time to be seated is obnoxious ... we didn\'t EVEN have to wait (maybe because it was a weekday).  In fact, the restaurant wasn\'t even CLOSE to being full, but we ended up waiting for SERVICE. Can\'t ever win with this restaurant, can you?\n\nThe hostess sat us down and we waited at our table right under the Serendipity poster (ooh so exciting, for me at least!) for about 10 minutes with about 3 waiters/waitresses walking by our table multiple times.  Did anyone offer to take our order?  No.  We even managed to go out of our way from looking at the menu, to purposely lock eyes with the employees breezing on by, and NOT ONE WORD from any one of them.  I even saw from what looked like to be the manager, "managing" the kitchen (which is in plain view for customers).  It\'s too bad that that \'manager\' obviously doesn\'t know how to manage their employees.  Thank you beautiful, Kate & John, for being so romantic on that poster hanging on the wall and for entertaining me for that 10 minutes of no service.\n\nSo, while attempting not to die from heat exhaustion, all 4 of us got up and walked to the bar.  You think if you physically got up and moved to a location with a bartender, you\'d get some service.  Bahahaha, NO!  Not at all.  After 5 minutes of sitting at the bar with unpleasant facial expressions written across all of our faces, the bartender finally noticed us.  After he handed us menus, we told him that we had already sat down, no one helped us at the table so that\'s why we went to the bar, and we obviously already knew what we wanted to order.\n\n/// Bartender: "Oooh, so you already sat down eh?  Oh well I\'m sorry about that [obviously not in a genuine voice, more like a \'sucks to be you!\' tone]. Well, you know there\'s more than those flavors listed on the menu for the frozen hot chocolate.  We have a menu just for the frozen hot chocolate flavors."\n\nI don\'t care if you have a WHOLE other menu just for frozen hot chocolate, I just wanted to order my double oreo frozen hot chocolate and indulge in its party-in-your-mouth taste.\n\nAfter enjoying the frozen hot chocolate (which is huge, wish there was less whip cream in it) we ended up waiting another 10 minutes to get our bill ....... then another 5 minutes for the bartender flirting with the single chicks on the side of us to give us our bill ......... and another 5 minutes for him to take our credit cards and swipe them ........ and then, well, MORE WAITING.\n\nI would only go back here IN DESPERATION to get the frozen hot chocolate because the experience was SHITTY and the food\'s EXTREMELY over-priced. I\'ve had better experiences from casino waitresses on the gambling floor. Other than that, I\'d rather hold out and go to the original one in New York. Good luck, future victims!'

S"At least I can say I went!! :)\n\nNot that the experience was horrible. We did have to wait like 45 minutes for a table and about 20 minutes for an order of onion rings but considering this everything was just perfectly sub par.\n\nWith all of the hype surrounding this popular NY/LV eatery my friends and I just haddd to go there. After the 45 minute wait we finally were sat down and the one person who had been there and was dying for their waffle fries asked where it went on the menu. He LAUGHED and said they don't serve them anymore. (liiil rude esp since he just had gotten started as our server).\n\nAnyhoo we ordered the onion rings. They took a good 20 minutes to come out and uhhh they tasted like onion rings. It's cute how everybody thinks something is so amazing off of a gimmick such as making it into a tower, but try putting them on a plate y'all. They're plain cheese dusted onion rings.\n\nEntrees: no one was particularly blown away by anything in particular. I did like my chicken pot pie but the flavor was nothing different than one I could have gotten out of the frozen food section. (maybe hit it up with some herbs?) my friend did like and actually finish her summer bries sandwich and the other 2 girls liked their burgers but our last friends veggie burger got a great big ol YUCKO all around. It was house made/some non boca burger version which we appreciated but the gratitude ends there. It tasted like it was made from chopped up al dente garbanzo beans (al dente garbanzos are not looked upon highly in the bean world) and just flat out had no flavor. Even the massive chunk of avocado couldn't save it. She wept.\n\nAfter the tears were gone we tried to alleviate her pain with their faaaamous frozen hot chocolate. To our servers dismay we split the single serving between 5 girls. We received the whip cream tower that was the frozen hot chocolate and dug in. It was perfectly boring. Every single person that raved about this dessert needs to go out and have an actual decadent chocolate dessert experience. Only then will you understand how terribly non chocolatey and boring this rip off of a dessert was. It made us reminisce to the rich thick mousse like creaminess that was cravings @ mirage's chocolate pudding. We all wept. \n\nOverall it was okay but I'd def want to try any and every other restaurant on the strip before I came back."

S"Well. This was disappointing.\n\nI guess it's a good thing this restaurant is in Las Vegas, because I was already expecting to spend exorbitant amounts of money on really stupid things that I would grow to regret, and that's exactly what I did.\n\nI was looking forward to trying a frozen hot chocolate at Serendipity 3. I love dessert, and it was about 6,000 degrees outside. The restaurant was conveniently located just outside of our hotel, so we trudged our way over and placed our orders at the take-out window in the back (for those customers who are not in the mood for a sit-down meal). We then forked over $11 each, received our drinks (the basic Frrrozen Hot Chocolate) and trudged over to the seating area closest to the water misters.\n\nMaybe it would have been better to sit down and order inside the restaurant. Who knows? All I know is that I was very saddened by my frozen hot chocolate. Because that sounds really fancy! That sounds like it should be exotic and delicious! But after a sip or two, it dawned on me that we'd totally just spent $11 on a glorified chocolate milkshake that was probably worth $2-3 at most.\n\nThere is nothing interesting, exciting or innovative about the frozen hot chocolate at all. It's not even that tasty. I had been taken for a ride. I will be happy to never return to Serendipity 3.\n\nBut I do like the font they use on their menu."

If you want an awesome burger, go to Ramsay's joint in PH. \n\nWe've been twice, about three years apart, and both times the service was extremely slow and the food (minus the ice cream) was just mediocre. They do have some awesome cocktails, though (crazy pricey but looked delicious - I had the one made with Crystal Light and it was yummy, although imagining the kind of margin they get  on a drink like that nearly made me sick).\n\nCheck-in on Foursquare for a free Frozen Hot Chocolate."

S'Dessert fans unite!\n\nI am not one but the wifey definitely is...  She dragged me to the original Serendipity 3 in NYC and we\'ve been to this one in Vegas quite a few times.   It\'s almost always a dessert trip here so I don\'t have any advice on the food.  I did have the Fried Oreo Cookie Sundae which is just about one of the best dessert\'s I\'ve eaten from a restaurant.  They don\'t do the classic County Fair fried oreo... Here they "bread it" with Corn Flakes and when it melts the ice cream a little... its like dunking your oreo cookie in milk when you are eating it together with the ice cream.  \n\nMy wife has always been a fan of the frooozen hot chocolate and now they have many different flavors.  I think we ended up with the classic one for everyone to try.  We had gotten the apple cobbler ala mode also to share with the group and it was a pleasant change to the other dishes being that it didn\'t feel like a complete sugar overload.  The apples had a perfect tart contrast with the cobbler and ice cream and it created a nice addition to the mix.\n\nI\'m a fan... are you?'

Highly recommended.\n\nThis time I decided to try something knew so I got the marshmallow mint explosion. It took a bit longer to make but when it came, it looked like a big blob of goodness with mint chocolate ice cream, thick chocolate chips and a marshmallow cream up top. However, It was ultra sweet and almost unbearable.... I really got sick of it after just a few bites and almost could not finish the thing. After I had the dessert I was a bit sick to my stomach, I don't recommend getting this. Should have stuck to their frozen hot chocolate."

I ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate because I had to try it while my mom ordered some kind of sundae with Deep Fried Oreos on top. As I said before, the desserts were pretty good. Especially the oreos. I've never tasted something so good before. I will say though, I did hear that the Frozen Hot Chocolate was supposed to be warm AND cold at the same time, hence the name, but it all tasted like a milkshake. I mean, it was still good, but I was a bit disappointed in that tiny bit about it.\n\nWell, not only did it seem like our waiter completely forgot about us while we ate, it took forever for him to show up after we were finished eating so we could get the check. And then, it took him a good while again to come back and deliver our final receipt. \n\nLook, I would say to go to this place to try out the Frozen Hot Chocolate or some other dessert, but just be prepared about the service.

The prices can be a bit high, but you are in Las Vegas so it'll always be high (think of how much the Starbucks is across the street). I got their grilled cheese with tomato soup and that was delicious. So was their chicken strips, but when you think about it, you can probably get that somewhere else for a cheaper price.

By that I mean, perhaps you should dine in, have a full, meal, and then top off with one of the many desserts.\n\nI ordered my frozen hot chocolate to go, which could have been mistake number one, but I was not trying to stand in the heat for 35 minutes for a table when all I wanted was to try the frozen hot chocolate. \n\nI ordered the frozen hot chocolate for two and only waited about 5 minutes before a huge, frothy, behemoth of a frozen drink was placed in my hands. Here\'s the thing: it was delicious. It\'s far more spectacular than a Wendy\'s frosty (yes, I\'m making the comparison... and you\'ll see why soon). A friend of a friend went once and complained that she paid $12 for a big frosty. Well, she\'s wrong on that count. At first taste, you can tell immediately that the chocolate is special. It\'s quality and it\'s generously used throughout. However, it\'s so quality that all I needed was a sip. The same went for my boyfriend. So, really, a "for two" should have been two shot glasses. It was THAT rich. \n\nI don\'t know if I\'ll ever order this again, I spent $20 for two sips and left the rest sitting at  Caesar\'s Palace slot machine for some hungry freegan to find their own "jackpot" but it was worth tasting.'

First off, we waited about 20 minutes for our waiter to take our drink order, then another 10 for that to be served to us and then another 30 minutes for our desserts to come out. To top it off the dessert wasn't even that amazing. But what made it such a bad experience, I mean enough for me to write a review because I don't ever write reviews but this one I couldn't let go. The wait staff, they were horrible, no customer service skills what so ever. As we're sitting there waiting for our bill, the waiter finally comes to give it to us. Then sitting there waiting for him to take it, we see him clearing off other tables and taking dishes to the back and he doesn't come back out. So I flag a waiter down and ask him if he could get out waiter, which he said he would. Still no sign of him. So I finally walk up front to the hostess and ask him can we please pay our bill, we've been sitting there waiting for 30 minutes. He says he will get our waiter. Still no sign. Then we ask another waiter and finally he takes our bill to the back and gives it to our server. Finally 10 minutes he walks out with our credit card slips. Guess what bud no tip for you!!

I don\'t know). So we\'re sitting outside by the door and near a fan. We\'ve been waiting for a while and I get up to go check to see if they called our name. Apparently the hostess did (inside? she knew we were outside) and since we weren\'t there crossed us off the list and moved us to the bottom. She was also very rude to us about it. \n\nWhatever, no big deal. I\'ll take your attitude, just seat me, I\'m starving. \n\nFinally after waiting for a few minutes (this time I stood near their hostess station so they knew I was in existence) and my party was seated. Naturally it was uncomfortably hot but we were seated in probably the worst area. It was so hot, I was disgustingly (and embarrassingly) taking ice out of my drink and letting it melt on my legs. :hangs head in shame:\n\nOur waiter was very nice and made up for the hostess. I wanted lunch and asked for something "small." Apparently their tuna salad was the smallest salad but this thing was massive!!! It was very good, but I\'m still cautious about getting fish in the middle of the desert. \n\nAnyway, no dessert. I think if I was back in Vegas and wasty face, I\'d make a stop to try the dessert.

S"I'm pretty sure this place is over hyped... But my vegas trip is NOT complete without a trip here! I love the frozen hot chocolate even though it costs $11 for a single serving and is mostly whipped cream. Its sure to give you diabetes and is probably a million calories, but its so friggin delicious. \n\nThe food here is really good too. Not sure about the salads though, my friend got the chicken caesar salad ($17) and it didn't seem that great to me, just overpriced. I got the high heel pump because I saw some else eating it and it looked & tasted great. It was big enough for me to be FULL after eating 1/3. So you can definitely order a frozen hot chocolate for two ($15) and the high heel pump. It would feed two people!\n\nWe were originally going to order an oreo sundae, but after eating we decided not to because we were STUFFED. I'll be back next time to order a sundae if I'm back in Vegas!!!"

S"I ordered a breakfast croissant sandwich. Very similar to an egg McMahon from McDonald's but on a croissant. The egg (cooked in the same way as an egg Mcmuffin) had the texture of rubber. We had a hard time cutting through with my knife. My meal also came with dried, sat under a heat lamp for a few hours breakfast potatoes. It was the worst meal ever. McDonald's gets 5 stars compare to this. \nThe bartender apologized for the bad food. But did not offer a discount, even after he saw my entire meal was left on the plate. \nThey get a star for presentation. \nThe drinks: Blueberry lemon drop is tasty, refreshing and potent. \nStrawberry chocolate mojito is also another refreshing drink. Not very minty. \nThey get 4 stars on the bartenders attentive service and drinks. \nI won't come back unless I'm craving one of the drinks mentioned."

S'Overrated.\n\nOkay so I\'ve only heard about this place and the "frozen hot chocolate" so many times... so I thought for a really long time that this place was like a bakery or cafe that served drinks and dessert.\n\nSo when I finally came with a few coworkers and saw the menu of burgers and hot dogs, I was slightly disappointed. Other disappointments:\n\n- Insane wait. 45 minutes for a table of 5\n- Frozen hot chocolate. It was good, but not $15 good\n- The food. Though tasty, so greasy and made me feel sick for the rest of the night\n- The presentation of the food. I think they\'re trying to come off as boutique, but it\'s just inconvenient and inefficient to eat your food from one large dish when you have six other small dishes of individual condiments around you. It\'s fine if you\'re by yourself, but when you\'re at a table with 4 other people and they also have 4 other dishes besides their main dish, you fight for elbow space\n- The scary baby. This isn\'t S3\'s fault, but there was a baby who was staring straight at us with no expression. It was freaky, man\n\nI mean, come on now. $15 for a foot-long hot dog? I don\'t care how awesome that hot dog was (it wasn\'t that great) or that we\'re in Las Vegas or if you serve it on a foot-long dish that holds it perfectly. No hot dog is worth more than a $1 per inch. It\'s a hot dog, aka, blended leftover parts from animals. I\'d rather buy two hot dogs from Costco AND get two drinks!'

We spent almost 2 and a half hours there. They should have just comped our meal. They even got our check wrong which we caughht before paying.  On the plus side, the fries were crispy."

S"The fun, colorful dining room marries well with Serendipity's selection of over-the-top food.  A foot-long hot dog? Yep, they have that.  Massive sundaes and chocolate drinks served in goblets?  Check.  We sampled the strawberry frozen hot chocolate, mint frozen hot chocolate, red velvet sundae, chicken chopped salad, nachos, and heirloom tomato salad.  Everything was very good.  Of the savory dishes, my favorite was the nachos because the tortilla chips were so light and crispy.  Of the sweet, I enjoyed the mint hot chocolate, though I thought it could use more mint flavor.  Service is cheerful and prompt.  Expect long lines and a wait, so try to make a reservation."

S'I had just seen a show at Caesars and decided to go to Serendipity 3 and do "Grab-N-Go". (This is the outside walkup window not the inside sit down restaurant)\n\nBacon Cheeseburger, fries and soda. \nThe price of $16.22 is fair considering it is Las Vegas.\n\nAll food is cooked to order. The burger was cooked fine.  The bacon tasted like it was in a prep pan for hours.  I have worked in a hotels and kitchens for almost 30 years and I know lame bacon when I taste it.\n\nThe fries were the highlight of the meal. \n\nThe order taker was pleasant and efficient.  \'Wait for your soda ... your number will be called at the other window ... thank you\'.   Again ... pleasant.\n\nMajor issue: The customers can see into the kitchen and service areas.  You can see when your order is complete.  You can see your order sit under the heat lamp while the girl expediting and making drinks is TEXTING!  My number was called and my order was placed on the counter.  No "thank you" ... no "enjoy your meal" ... no "please come again"\n\nWithin a 10 minute walk north or south on "The Strip" there are two burger places ... "Stripburger" and "Fat Burger" both have better burgers and service.  \n\nIf you see a show at Caesars ... and you want a burger afterwards ... take the 10 minute walk ... skip Serendipity 3.\n\nOrder # 4170293 21:34 12/07/2014'

It was nice and cool and chocolately.. and just perfection in my mouth..  \n\nHubby and I had the size meant for two.. and I think we drank that thing in less than three minutes.. I kinda wish I drank it slower and savored it more.. \n\nThe fam also had lunch there..\n\nMom and I split the spaghetti with meatballs.. that was pretty good.. I like tangy marinara sauces and this one was perfectly tangy.. and the meatballs were pretty tasty.. \n\nDad had a foot-long hotdog.. it wasn't too bad.. I think the bun really made the hot dog.. I liked it.. but I don't think I would have been able to eat a whole thing..\n\nHubby had the ABC burger.. I didn't taste it.. but I dont' think he was too impressed.. \n\nService was great.. everyone was really friendly..

S'I was totally intrigued the first time I heard of frozen hot chocolate. How can it be frozen and hot?! Well.. after trying it out first hand, I conclude that it was a total waste of my $12 (for just a to go cup size)! It was simply a thick powdery super sweet cold chocolate drink! I rather have a glass of chocolate milk ):\n\nI later found out that this other place called sugar factory also has frozen hot chocolate on their menu- for just $6-7. If any of my friends insist on trying it in the future, I would take them to this place instead. I wonder what big of a diff it will be.'

The frozen hot chocolate is fantastic!\nAmbiance:  Nice.  That's what it's all about, at least if you dine inside.\nService:  We sat the bar and ate, so service was great and the servers were friendly.\nThought:  Again, a little over priced, but the desserts are great!"

S'Not really sure what all the fuss is about. \nIt is poorly located and feels out of place. The food was pretty average. I had the skirt steak and it was actually greasy, and bland. If its going to be greasy at least it should have some flavor. The frozen hot chocolate was good, but not amazing. The scenery was fine, I get what they are trying to do, but its contrived and just seems out of place. Funny thing is that I really want to like it, but the food was just not good. I will try again in hopes that it was a bad night.'

S'After reading review after review of Serendipity 3, I was so stoked to head over there when my friends and I were in town. The restaurant itself is adorable, really colorful, girly, pink and just plain cute. \n\nAs far as the service, we got our food in a reasonable amount of time, given that they were really busy. Our server was really nice and cheerful; I appreciate that because the last thing you want is a grumpy server. With the reception though, there were issues with one of the hostesses (err she ticked me off) but I won\'t go into that because she later apologized.\n\nI ordered the three cheese grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup. This has got to be one of the cutest presentations I\'ve seen in a while because it had goldfish crackers in the soup. SO ADORABLE! Even with three layers of bread, I still could taste mostly cheese which was really yummy. I kind of wish there was a little less brie because there was a little too much of it. The soup was good too, not the best I\'ve ever had but not the worst, that\'s for sure. \n\nOkay... here we go... I think I read one too many reviews of  the Frrozen Hot Chocolate. Everyone (not just Yelpers but everyone period) has hyped it up to the point where I expected it would taste like how D\'Angelo looked in the "How Does it Feel" music video... just good all over. (Nice visual, right? LOL) I wish nobody told me anything because I would\'ve liked it a lot more. Honestly, in my opinion, it was a chocolate milkshake with halo-halo* ice mixed in with a bunch of whipped cream on it.  Good but not good enough for me to pay $10 again, which I really didn\'t because my friends and I split it because it was huge.\n\n*Don\'t know what it is? Look it up LOL\n\nFYI: Lines are and will always be long. If you want to dine in the restaurant, be prepared to wait. If not, there is a to go menu :]'

S"It's an absolute tourist destination (duh) and its usually always busy. What is nice is that while of course you're paying more than you would at an off-strip dining establishment, you're at least feeling like you're getting your moneys worth. My favorite cholesterol level raising option is their steak sandwich. It comes on a loaf (yeah a goddamn loaf) of garlic bread, an entire NY strip steak, bacon, and perfectly runny over easy eggs. It's $22 bucks (it seems pricey, I know), but it's big enough to share and both parties will be full and a little bit closer to a heart attack. Another favorite of mine is the lump crab and artichoke dip.It's decadent, indulgent, it's everything you want in a creamy, rich appetizer. I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the frozen hot chocolates. I've tried the original, the peanut butter, and the cookies and cream. Cookies and cream is my favorite, it's creamy, sweet and I'm sure it goes straight to your thighs. The original is alright, but I feel like it is missing the creaminess that like in a cold chocolate drink. Peanut butter was kinda gross and I didn't finish it. It had a lot more to do with the peanut butter taste not really gelling with the cold uncreamy texture that's inherent in this drink. If you really like peanut butter taste, but don't require a creamy texture, i.e. you eat crunchy peanut butter, you'll probably like it. If you like creamy peanut butter like Texans love guns, skip it. \n\nService is hit or miss here. Usually good, but sometimes (especially if you're sitting outside I've noticed) your server seems to forget you and you have to wait for everything. The other thing I'm not a fan of is there indoor seating arrangements. I understand you want to maximize your space with tables because mo' tables, mo' money, but it's pretty cramped inside. Overall, if you're living in town and wanted to try it, try and go on a weekday during the low season. If you're an out-of-towner wanting to try this place out, prepare for a long wait (maybe have dessert BEFORE dinner and grab an iced hot chocolate while you're waiting) and consider sharing."

I've attempted to actually dine and eat in the restaurant numerous times- but it was always so crowded. I definitely recommend making a reservation because this place is always jammed packed. If you can't make it inside, they do have an outdoor to go window where you can get their famous hot chocolate and other sweet & savory goodies.\n\nAs for the food itself, I've tried the classic frozen hot chocolate and the red velvet sundae. The hot chocolate honestly just tastes like a thicker milkshake..nothing tok special, & definitely over hyped. I personally liked the red velvet sundae better. Also, beware! These servings are huge and should be shared in my opinion :)"

S'I made a reservation a day in advance for brunch, this place was hard to find from the self park and i feel like i walked forever until we found it, upon arriving the hostess was not welcoming i told her i had a reservation (i will admit i was 15min late) and she checked her ipad and just blankly told me "no i don\'t see your reservation". Another gentleman asked her what the wait was, she ignored him and told me again "no you have no reservation here". I showed her my open table email and she looked at me like "whatever". She was rude and had no customer service at all. We were seated and our waitress was nice, but the hostess ruined for me. Being a hostess myself i cant believe people like that are employed. Food was good but a little overpriced for just breakfast. There are better places on the strip skip this place.'

S'I go to vegas every year, and we have been to serendipity at least 4 times in the last two years. Three of the four visits were outstanding. One of the visits was less than great with a very long wait for lukewarm food.  On this last trip we went for dinner twice.  The first night I had the heirloom tomato salad and my friend ordered the chicken strips.  The salad is amazing! Huge, ripe tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and the best honey mustard dressing.  It also had some sort of nuts on it that tasted like pine nuts.  Fresh basil was sprinkled on top.  The chicken strips were really good.  The batter is tempura so it was light and crispy. The chicken was juicy and there was a lot of it.  On the second trip, I had the same salad and we tried the "can\'t say no" sundae.  Peanut butter pie with vanilla and coffee ice cream, bananas, whipped cream and chocolate sauce.  It was so good and 2 of us were only able to finish half of one sundae.  I love this place and will stop by each time we go to vegas.  The service is great sometimes and less than great sometimes.....but that is true for most restaurants in Vegas.  The frozen hot chocolate is just so-so.  Nothing exciting...but the sundaes are great! And the apple pie dessert is wonderful.  I always request to sit on the patio because inside is very loud and feels like a cafeteria.  The patio is less crowded and has a great view of either ceasars or the strip.'

" or "A fortunate accident" like in the movie of the same name. Passing by in a taxi cab was how we saw this new Caesar Palace location!\n\nWe shared their signature Frrrozen Hot Chocolate which was ginormously devine! It tastes like a fudgesicle bar blended up with chocolatey goodness. It definitely lived up to all its hype! Good thing we came on an empty stomach because we also shared their Strawberry Fields Sundae which had 3 fat scoops of strawberry ice cream, a big slice of yummy cheesecake, fresh whip cream, all topped with strawberries! Holey moley it was huge as well!\n\nThe desserts were heavenly! I would definitely come back every time I\'m in Las Vegas!

S'Frrrozen hot chocolate? I thought my friends were a bit kooky when they suggested this frozen treat. They were spot on with their raves. It wasn\'t your usual "shake" or  "malted". My little friend and I got the double so we could share. Good idea, we didn\'t even drink/eat it all. \n\nAlthough I didn\'t order the brownie sundae and neither did anyone in my party, I did taste it. Phenomenal! You\'re wondering how I accomplished this huh? Well, I look over at the table next to us and see a guy with this monstrous sundae in front of him. I lean over with my fork like I\'m going to steal a bite, mischevious look and all. To my surprise, my new friend holds out the untouched sundae and invites me to help myself. Mama didn\'t raise no dummy, I took a big bite and ate it with my eyes closed so I could taste every component. I need to share that with someone next time.\n\nAs far as the food. Meh. I think I\'ll stick to desserts. Not that the food wasn\'t good, it just wasn\'t anything spectacular for the price. I had the asparagus omelet which was good but nothing to write home about. That\'s OK, they can focus their attention on their desserts. Fine by me.'

S'I was super excited to find out that Serendipity opened up a location in Las Vegas! Of course for a getaway weekend we\'d spend one of our meals there.\n\nWe get there and there is a 30 min wait, but we\'re down for it as there is a quick stop bar where the ladies partook in a frozen hot chocolate to wait out the line. Out front there are also shaded tables to wait by.\n\nWhen we finally got in we were seated on their outside deck, close to one of the mist fans that was partially broken. It kept dripping water on one of my friends. \n\nWe quickly decided and tried to flag down our waitress.  It was incredibly hot outside and we wanted something to drink. Water took a while to come out and when we were ready to order our waitress took her time getting to us, giving us the index finger "one minute" signal while she continued to gab away with a coworker. \n\nEventually we got our orders in, and I ordered the french toast log. I think it took close to 40 mins for our food to arrive. By that time we were seriously pondering leaving and just paying for the drinks. But when we got our food it was all tasty, every plate was gi-huge-o. My log of french toast was ridiculous. \n\nTrying to get our waitress to come bring us the check was another ordeal. Good food, but ultimately disappointing service, combined with a dripping fan and sitting on the hot patio. I think I\'ll just stick to going to Serendipity when I\'m in NYC again, at least that time proved worthy of the wait.'

S'So we\'re on the Deuce rolling along the strip when we passed by Serendipity 3. My sister and I literally let out squeals of delight and started screaming "we gotta come here for dessert!!!" yes, we did, in a bus full of strangers and we were possibly jumping up and down in the process. Did i mention, I\'m 29 and my sister is 26.. and yes we still get excited for ice cream. \n\nWhat we didn\'t realize, was there was this Buddhist shrine that\'s been donated to Cesare\'s and was placed right in front of Serendipity (super random right?) It was incredibly gorgeous with sand pits for incense, and they even provided incense and matches for prayers! Being the Buddhist we are, my sister, mommy and i promptly lit up and did some prayers. Was funny because there were all these people passing by us and they started taking pictures of us during our prayer. YEA US! \n\n\nWhat I Thought: We got there around 9:30pm on a weds night and the wait was only 25 mins. We were seated indoors (thank god, even at night it was bloody hot) I\'ve heard so much about Serendipity (blame food network) i was extremely excited we found time in our schedule to stop by. And yes, i realize the "frozen hot chocolate" is really just glorified chocolate milk, but the point is.. I REALLY WANTED ONE!!! (damn you perky Rachel Ray for putting the thought in my head) \n\nWho I Dragged Along: Ros and our Mommy \n\nAtmosphere: Uber cute!, very sweet candy shop feel. \n\nPrice: For the 3 of us, the total was $50-something including tax and tip. \n\nWhat We Ate: We decided to share a meal since we knew we wanted to make room for dessert. \nSpinach/Artichoke dip - serious yum with huge pieces of shaved parm on top, my mom adored this \n3 cheese omelet with waffle fries - oomg FLUFFIEST OMELET EVER!!! It was seriously huge, I\'m thinking..maybe 6 eggs went into it? It was soft, fluffy, filled with goooey cheese and was seriously.. perfect! \nVanilla/coffee hot fudge sundae - my sister\'s choice, it was good as far as sundae\'s go, but.. $14 for ice cream and chocolate sauce? ummm... \nFrozen hot chocolate - Ok.. so $11 for basically... chocolate milk blended with ice and a load of whipped cream on top, and don\'t get me wrong, it was rich, creamy and delish! I drank nearly the entire thing and it was great for a 1 time thing to do. But really.. i was.. i dunno, underwhelmed? \n\nParking: ride the deuce baby!! \n\nWould I Come Back: yes and i want the omelet when i do! seriously, yummiest omelet ever! \n\nDid i miss anything?: Did i mention the omelet? I gotta mention our waitress, she was awesome, attentive and took great care of us.\nMy mom is fantastic, but like a typical Asian Mom, she complains a bit... nothing was said about this place, so if it pleases Mom, it makes our night a Lil happier!'

My opinion is that you're better off going somewhere else.\n\nIt's like 100+ degrees with a decent sized line and the cashier is moving like molasses.  I don't understand how come he is so slow, he is only taking orders...not filling orders.  It's odd when the line at fast food chains can move so fast while this place moves so slow\n\nAnd the wait would be worth it if the food was amazing...but it's not.  The frozen hot chocolate (which i believe is their signature item) is nothing more then a glorified frappuccino that costs 2-3x as much as the starbucks version.\n\nAnd i got a grasshopper marshmallow mint sundae that was as disappointing as humanly possible.   It's like 50% vanilla ice cream, 50% whipped cream, a bunch of mint chocolate chunks and possibly some marshmallow syrup?  I couldn't even taste any marshmallow.

It did take us about 10 minutes to be greeted, and finally the host that sat us came back to see if anyone had greeted us yet. \n\nWe both had breakfast; my girlfriend said the Juevos were amazing and she nearly cleared her plate.  I had the Hangover Omelette and it was gigantic!  Definitely too much food for 1 person, maybe? Unless you're really hungry, I guess.  \n\nThe food was good; our server was pretty nice but seemed a little overwhelmed.  But he was nice enough to bring us cheesecake pops since he made us wait when we originally sat down.  And if that wasn't enough, we had to try the Frozen Hot Chocolate...I guess I was expecting something more exciting?  But it was still good."

S"I have out of town guests no less than 10 times per year. The last time I went here, was the last time. Service was so horrible we left before even getting our food; our waitress took our order - a burger and a veggie burger and then never came back to our table. 45 minutes, she walked by multiple times as everyone around us got food and refills. Our glasses empty, no explanations until she saw us get up to leave and sprinted over to beg us to stay, because she forgot to put our order in. I politely told her no, we had been there over an hour counting how long we waited to place our order, and that enough was enough, that next time that happened to her she should make her customers aware and maybe offer a water refill. No offer to speak to a manager, the hostess clearly didn't care either since we were seated beside the hostess stand, and my tweet to the restaurant went unanswered. I'll take my local dollars, and my tourists' dollars elsewhere."

S'So I finally tried this place that is oh-so popular in NYC, but you can now find it in Las Vegas. It\'s right off the strip, in front of Caesars Forums called Serendipity 3. They are known for their signature Frozen Hot Chocolate. My friend and I had the Alfredo pasta and macaroni and cheese. At first we were like "this is amazing!". That was only because we were hungry, after the first few bites we realized the food was okay and not that great. Prices were pricey and it seems like the food is large portioned. My mac & cheese didn\'t seem so big but when I realized when I was done eating, I still had enough to feed another person. Prices average between $14.00 to $1,000.00 (if you decide to get one of their Golden Opulence Sundaes). I wasn\'t going to let my disappointing dinner get to me! I was there for their Frozen Hot Chocolate. It\'s about $9.00 and for the double frozen hot chocolate, I think it\'s about $11.00. My friend and I shared the regular frozen hot chocolate. Was I disappointed? Actually no! It tastes just like what it\'s called. If you ever had hot chocolate, its just like that, but served cold with thin ice chips in it, sooooo yummy. I would definitely come back, but probably only for desert. Don\'t care much to spend an arm and a leg for the food. Definitely a place to splurge on desert!'

S'Serendipity means "happy accident" or "pleasant surprise," but unfortunately, this restaurant was neither. The wait, service, and food were all just mediocre, but it is a good place to take someone just for the experience. \n\nI normally do not mind the wait for popular restaurants, but the ladies who are in charge of the line are horrible at giving approximate wait times and they don\'t accommodate for everyone who is waiting to get placed on the waiting list. There were a handful of people who were ignored... who ended up leaving because of the horrible service they\'re getting (and they didn\'t even sit down yet!). We waited quite a long time to get seated, but our server was pretty helpful in helping us choose what to order. We decided to share the Don\'t Drop Your Skirt Steak Frites. It looks really fancy, but it didn\'t taste as fancy as it looked.\n\nWe also ordered the Frozen Hot Chocolate that everyone orders when they go to Serendipity. Now, I\'m not a huge fan of chocolate, but I do enjoy hot chocolate. I thought frozen hot chocolate was going to taste super different, but it was just like regular hot chocolate! For a little over $10, I think I\'ll just make my own at home.'

S'This place is absolutely horrible. If asked o honestly couldn\'t think of a worse experience I\'ve ever had at a restaurant. I usually don\'t write reviews because I generally feel like each persons experience is always different. Sometimes it can be the waiter or just a bad thing you ordered and some people want to give the place one star for it. Well this isn\'t that. This place is genuinely the worst restaurant I\'ve ever been in. And I\'ve been to A LOT. It was my wife and I\'s 5th year anniversary and we picked this place out of any other in Vegas because it sounded fun and like it had a huge variety. We wanted a place somewhere around 25-30 a plate so that we knew it\'d be good food but still affordable. We had a reservation for 9 which means that each person had to spend a minimum of $25 dollars as well as a mandatory 18% gratuity added to the bill. We get there and have to wait an hour to be seated. We told them it was our 5 year anniversary and wanted it to be special. I guess special to them is a small table with 9 seats around it right by the front door when they have parties of about 4 taking up giant booths. Anyways, I finally order and get their $23 fried chicken meal - it was worse than literally a fried chicken made in a TV dinner. The mashed potatoes had the viscosity of water with a little bit of sand in it. HORRIBLE. We tell them our displeasure with our experience and are told "were sorry you feel that way", the end. I would never suggest this place to anyone in my life and I hope this place goes under and everyone that works there can never find a job in the food service industry again.'

S'This restaurant was interesting to say the least. The food was decent for the price. While a bit pricey, the food was cooked the way we asked for it but still a bit bland. My boyfriend ordered the Las Vegas Strip sandwich, which was French bread, steak, eggs, and bacon. You would think it would be awesome, but according to him it was just "ok." I ordered the Chinese chicken salad, which came with cold unseasoned chicken (dressing was good but again just ok for an $18 salad). Service was great, and desserts looked phenomenal- a place for dinner? Not my first choice.'

S'Frozen Hot Chocolate is to die for!! You can never go wrong with this place. Make reservations ahead of time if you can, that cuts off the 45mins and so on wait! \n\nOur party waited for about 45 mins to be seated, but I thought it wasn\'t that bad since my girlfriend waited about 2 hours the last time she went. They get your cellphone number too and text you when you\'re table is ready. +1 star ! \n\nThe only thing I don\'t like about this place is the wait for FOOD. It\'s a looooooooooooong loooooooooooooong wait!  - 1 star\n\nWe all ordered "The Hangover Omelette" ($15.00) and it was very satisfying. It has Bacon, Mushrooms, Cheese, and Fries inside. BOMB! Since I love BACON!! It also comes with either Breakfast potatoes on the side or their seasoned fries for Brunch. + 1 star\n\n\nAnd for the Finale, the reason of our visit... we had the Famous Original Frrozen Hot Chocolate. They come in two sizes. One for $11 and To share for $15. Heavenly!!!! It was so good and perfect for me since I got a sweet tooth! ;) They also offer a few more flavors of the Frozen Hot Chocolate.. and will definitely try when I come back. + 2 stars\n\nThe best $100 we spent on food! ;)'

S"After going to the new York location, there just is no comparison. I've been to the vegas location a couple of times over the past few years, and it was just ok and didn't meet the high price. Obviously the frozen hot chocolate was excellent, but my meal this trip fell very short from what one would expect with such prices. 30 minute wait for an inside seat OR 10-15 min wait for a table outside. 100 degrees in the shade on a hot patio with fan/mist machines that don't quite reach the tables didn't help the dining experience much. Basically leaving us an even shorter timeframe to enjoy that frozen hot chocolate. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs which was a huge disappointment. The meatballs were more raw than cooked. The outer layer was brown and looked cooked but the center was still pink and squishy. I realized this after eating half of one. Possibly why I felt sick the rest of the afternoon. Both of my meatballs were the same and my friends plate was exactly the same way. $130 for 4 people and I couldn't even eat my meal lol."

S'Myself and a friend were in Vegas  2/12/12 through 2/16/12. On Tuesday the 14th we decided to have breakfast at Serendipity. I had the eggs benedict which was fantastic. Everything went as it should for that visit and left me thinking that I would like to come back before we leave town.\nOn Thursday the 16th we went back to Serendipity to have breakfast. From the start this visit was less than acceptable. Upon our arrival the hostess and another female employee were talking at the hostess counter. We walked in and I said good morning after it was apparent that they were going to finish their conversation before greeting or seating us. Once we got seated it was near ten (10) min. before the waiter Kevin made his way to our table. He appeared to be professional on the surface. He took our drink orders and went to get them. I had coffee and my friend had water. Another five (5) min. passed then he returned with our drinks. At this point we realized that service was not going to be his strong point, so we made sure that we were ready to order. The wait for our food was well within the acceptable time period. After drinking my first cup of coffee while eating my breakfast I began watching for Kevin to ask for more coffee. After more than five (5) min. I stopped another female waitress and asked her for more coffee. She was happy to get more coffee for me and did so fairly quickly. Unfortunately there were a lot of coffee grounds in the coffee and dribbled on the table as well. Several min. passed then I finally saw Kevin and stopped him to ask for another cup due to the grounds issue. From that point forward the visit was unacceptable!!!!! Upon expressing my dissatisfaction over the service and the coffee grounds in the coffee, Kevin rather than being apologetic decided to cop an attitude about it. I am a business owner and would not tolerate this type of behavior out of an employee of mine. Long and short of this is that all Kevin had to do is apologize for the lack of timely service and get the coffee. end of story!!! After the complete bomb dropped by Kevin another male employee came out and stopped at our table and looked at me as if to say oh you are the one Kevin had a issue with..\nAll that said I still gave the restaurant three out of five stars because of the food quality and the service that I received on my first visit.\n\nOne last note the table beside up waited much much much longer for service form Kevin and were noticeable irritated as well.'

S'Serendipity 3 is an experience for any and everyone.  A great place in Las Vegas to bring your date, child or husband/wife.  Its subtly romantic while maintaining a very interesting Vegas vibe.  There must be some sort of secret no Douchebag\'s allowed rule because you wont find it here.  No old guys still wearing Ed Hardy (or even worse trying to be cool with a blazer and jeans.... come on guys that is so 2002, put on some slacks.).  But know, Serendipity 3 is a Vegas attraction so be prepared to pay accordingly.\n\nTHE FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATE - is amazing.  Absolutely amazing actually, it is no fluke that so many people enjoy it.  It is everything you imagine and more.  I compare it to an experience of eating a Jelly Bean and saying to yourself "OMG this popcorn jelly bean does taste like popcorn".  I\'m not sure why I didn\'t expect the frozen hot chocolate to taste like well, frozen hot chocolate.... but it did.  This is a must try, repeatedly.\n\n2 FOR 1 MARGARITAS - OK, I\'m not exactly sure what creative genius decided to pair dessert and margaritas but they did... and boy am I thankful.  For one the Margaritas are LARGE and in charge.  AND, yes there is more... they actually have liquor.  Most of the time there is so much of that limey mix and no tequila... not here, they give you your monies worth.\n\nBURGER - While I was last there I had the burger on the brioche bun,  Mmmmmm that bun was so buttery and delicious.  Although I want to try the hot dog next time.\n\n\nBefore the check comes take a deep breath and another swig of Margaritas.... like I said don\'t forget you are in Vegas.'

S"While strolling down the strip with a couple friends, a collective stomach growl could be heard and we all decided that food was in order, and fast! We looked across the street and the newly opened Serendipity was calling the names of the ladies in the group; with its bright pink sign and memories of the darling movie which bears the same name. So we sauntered over and were told there was a 20 minute wait. For a Friday night in Vegas, 20 minutes is a blink of an eye. We were called in less than half that time and taken in to be seated. The inside of the restaurant is a little girls dream; pink and blue recessed ceilings, huge colorful light fixtures, and a giant bright pink clock. The menu is fairly extensive for a place that I would have considered more of a dessert spot. The actual food items are MASSIVE. I kid you not, some of the largest items of food I have ever seen given to one person. The sweet potato fries that accompany the entrees are to die for. If you like them even in the slightest, I urge you to give these a shot. They are sprinkled with some sort of cinnamon/sugar/salt combo that is just divine. I ordered the chicken strips (lame I know) because I wasn't feeling all that well and wanted something I could trust. They were actually wonderful and came with three sauces for dipping. My tablemates ordered the worlds largest hot dog California style, a Turkey club that was the size of a VW Bug and a take on a caprese sandwich that weighed as much as a newborn baby. Everything was truly delicious. The drinks from the bar that we ordered (a cranberry mojito) were a little on the weak side, but I think that's what I've come to expect in this fair city. All in all, we had a great meal. The service was great until the waitress dropped a dish down my back. Luckily it was empty and only left crumbs and small food smear. Could have been much worse. I would dine here again for more than one reason, but the biggest one being - we didn't have dessert!! Shameful, trust me, I know. But we were all so stuffed from the massive portions. Good food for sure."

What I got was instant hot chocolate powder blended with milk and ice, which I could have made myself for about $0.75.  \n\nI don't know how good the food is but based on one of their signature dessert items, this place is a joke.  Do yourself a favor and grab an ice-blended mocha from the Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf at Lake Mead and Tenaya, that's what frozen hot chocolate should taste like."

Uh, you are a fancy schmancy ice cream shop and you don't make your own ice cream?  \n\nTo top it all off, there was a 30 minute wait to get in.  There is a real B&J's just down the street on the strip and another one in the Miracle Mile shops...So why waste your time at Serendipity 3?\n\nWhy? WHY?!"

After all the hype from the movie of the same name, we found Serendipity 3 to be less than impressive.\nWe had a waiter who dogged us to order for twenty minutes, while we read the extensive menu and tried to figure out what to have for dinner. They weren't busy. We finally settled on crabcakes, which were good but not fabulous. Then, we had a Frozen Hot Chocolate. Delicious, but somehow I expected more. Reported to have 20 different chocolates in it, were hard to determine.\n\nThe most off-putting part of the restaurant is that the music is SO loud, you can't carry on a conversation. Maybe that's why we didn't have a GREAT time there. That and the dogging waiter.\n\nWill we go there again? Probably not.

The food is fun, whimsical, and overly delicious. The Frozen Hot Chocolate is HUGE and to die for: served with two straws for sharing (awwwwweeee) and a big pile of whip cream on top! #winning \n\nCome hungry and bring money - while it is delish, it is also overpriced, but hey!

S"Went here twice on my last trip to Vegas with the fam. We had lunch here, pretty crowded since no one wanted to brave the heat and sit outside. We had a 30 min wait, a bummer. Once inside your senses are overloaded... lots of stuff on the walls, music blasting. It's fun, but not appreciated by my parents. \n\nAfter much deliberation (so many good looking items on the menu!), I got a cheeseburger with sweet potato fries. Definitely thumbs up on the portions - huge and plentiful. I'm a fan of sweet potato fries, but these came sprinkled with brown sugar. I know this place is known for it's sweets, but seriously. Yuck, not my thing. The burger was good. Juicy and tasty, for sure, definitely would recommend. The burger came on a sort of sweet bun. It was ok, but not my fav, guess I'm more of a savory person. My mom had the asian salad - it was gigantic! And tasted awesome. I should've gotten that. \n\nSecond visit of the trip my sister and I split a frozen hot chocolate. Tasty! Not quite a milkshake, but not chocolate milk. Good dessert if you have room after their large portioned meals. We used the takeout window for this order, which was easier and faster. \n\nIf you want to check out the hype, I recommend just going to the takeout window and eating outside or taking it inside Caesars. It's good, but not worth the trouble of doing the whole sit down meal thing. I think I'd come back and try some of their other dishes, but only if I were staying nearby. Don't think this is worth trekking across the strip for in 100 degree heat."

Now I get this is Vegas...but wow.\n\nThe frozen hot chocolate was great.  The pretzel was a big "S" shaped pretzel (which was cool), but I expected a nice warn, soft pretzel.

S'TERRIBLE service! We love the atmosphere and the food here, but I have to say, they are the WORST staff I\'ve experienced in all of Las Vegas. The first time we went, we had good service that turned bad once our waiter found out we weren\'t eating, just having the frozen hot chocolate ($15). (We were no longer worth his time.) Then the 2nd time we went in a group, all eating and drinking. Well first of all, one in our group tried to order a Cherry Limeade, and the waitress said "no, we don\'t have those". I suggested to her that perhaps her bartender could make one since it\'s only soda water, lime juice and cherry syrup. She looked at me like I was nuts, and didn\'t even offer to ask the bartender. We sat there in awkward silence until the person who tried to order it said, that\'s ok, I\'ll have a Cherry Pepsi instead. THEN I noticed that each time any of us got up from our table to walk the LONG journey to the disgusting outdoor/public bathrooms, whenever there was a clogged/crowded walkway through the restaurant, the STAFF would push through first and not let the customer walk through first. It\'s common courtesy to let others walk through a small space before you, and when you\'re the staff and a customer is waiting to get through, you should let the customer through first. I found many of the staff to be very rude in this way. They would even drop doors on the faces of their customers when going out to the patio. I have really never seen so many rude staff members in one establishment before. We also waited forever for our food which was served one person/plate at a time, and then waited forever for our waitress to deal with our check. She was also very rude about us splitting the bill on different credit cards. I was really disappointed in this experience because I really love the food there. I\'m now not sure I\'d go back.'

I've heard that the wait is bad during weekends but we were seated right away:] Its a really fun and hip atmosphere great with friends and for lunch. I know it does get a little pricy for what you get but the Frozen Hot Chocolate was well worth it!\n\noh yeaa.. REALLY cute interior!!"

S"Quickie: Service is whack. Frozen hot chocolate tastes like a slightly better version of a Wendy's Frosty (perhaps this is because it felt like a thousand degrees in Vegas...). \n\nThree of my friends and I decided to stop by to try the famous frozen hot chocolate on a late Sunday afternoon. I scoped the place out and saw at more than a dozen empty tables. Sweet, the wait was going to be nonexistent....NOT. The wait turned out to be 35-40 minutes. Why they refuse to seat people when they have plenty of open tables is beyond me!  I asked the snooty hostess why this was so and she said that it was the top of the hour so they had to seat everyone who was already on the list...that didn't even make sense. If there are open tables, shouldn't you seat guests?? The hostesses proceeded to seat two other groups before us in a span of 20 minutes...really?!\n\nWhen we were finally shown to one of the many open tables we took a quick glance at the menu and chose the sliders and a regular frozen hot chocolate for two. We closed our menus and waited for our waitress to come around, which probably seemed longer than it actually was due to the heat. She unpleasantly took our order then came out 5 minutes later and abruptly placed dishes on our table without saying a word to us. She must hate her job... \n\nThe sliders were decent and again, the frozen hot chocolate tasted like a frosty. I definitely was not worth $12.  \n\nIf I ever come back I will make a reservation and only to try the other appetizers/omelettes."

I only knew of the one in New York from the movie! I saw the menu and I was bummed that my boyfriend and I had brunch already because I really wanted to eat there but I checked out their desserts to see if there'd be something worth the extra calories. There really wasn't that appealed to me, and I am a serious dessert person! I asked the gal at the counter what the frozen hot chocolate was and she seemed less thrilled about it than I was about the dessert selection. I don't know, I'd really have to go back and eat there to give this place a fair rating but first impression for me was definitely lacking. I could try, but do I really want to? Eh. We'll see."

S'I know I know! I might get kicked off YELP for this one, but please dont be mad at me fellow foodies. \nI was super duper calafragalisticly excited to finally try the frozen hot chocolate! This was the only reason I came. So...\nI came, sat, ordered the famous (trademarked) frozen hot chocolate and I was sooooooooooo disappointed. It really looked and tasted like a thinned out chocolate milkshake or straight up cold chocolate milk with melted whip cream. OMG!! I was so crushed, it literally felt like a high school break up right before prom! \n\nThe food looked good though, from what I saw on other tables. So I would probably come back to nosh on some grub, but as for the frozen hot chocolate that Oprah swore by, I would kick myself if I order it again!!\n\nThe decor was super cute, looked like Betsey Johnson decided to decorate with the oversized deco and pink.

The service is a bit slow but the waiters are very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. \n\nThe portions are huge so be prepared to share if you want to have room or dessert. Or be like me and order first! My favorite was the basic frozen hot chocolate. I've tried the white chocolate one and was not very fond of it. \n\nThe sweet potato fries are yummy and the burger was good.

S"All of my friends talk about this place.  I see it all the time on the Travel Channel.  Last week I decided to give it a try.   Had to try the signature Frozen Hot Chocolate, of course.  Since D and I were starving when we got there, we also ordered a jalepeno pretzel and a cheese pizza.  \n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate - First of all, it was 10 bucks for a size comparable to Starbucks Grande size.  Second of all, it tasted worse than a grande chocolate frapachino.  Nasty powder chunks in the drink, and not even very chocolatey.  Save your money and your taste buds, go to starbucks.\n\nJalepeno Pretzel - 8 bucks.  Totally not worth it.  Tasted like spicy cardboard.  Go eat some desert sand.  I'm sure it will taste better.\n\nCheese Pizza - 10 bucks.  Tasted like a 5 year old made a pizza in an Easy Bake Oven. \n\nThe worst part....  we waited over 30 min in line.\n\nDon't think I'll be heading back there......."

S'TAKE AWAY:  The food and service here is mediocre; I heard the one in New York is better though.  There\'s usually a minimum of a 25 minute wait for a table (longer if it\'s busy).  People come here for the name and for their "Frrrozen Hot Chocolate," which costs $15 (large).  If you\'re looking for a novelty restaurant or place where all the hype is at, this place is it.  But expect nothing more.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS / TIPS:  It\'s best to go during off-peak hours (i.e., afternoon).  Frrrozen Hot Chocolate is great to try (it does taste great), but it\'s difficult to justify the $15 price tag.  ALSO, they (supposedly) charge a $4 sharing fee.  We were able to avoid it because we purchased 3 Frrrozen Hot Chocolate (practically entr\xc3\xa9e prices in and of itself).  Their sweet potato fries are good!\n\nDETAILS - DETAILS - DETAILS:\n-----------------------------------------------\nAtmosphere:\nIt\'s just one dining room and no waiting area; so if you\'re sitting next by the entrance, expect to feel the weather outside and perhaps someone standing over your shoulders as you eat.  The best way to describe the d\xc3\xa9cor is: wacky, eccentric, random, and maybe even a little bit nostalgic as they try to bring in some of that old-fashioned diner feel.\n\nService:\nThe wait here can be long at times.  Even during off-peak hours (e.g., 3:00pm) the wait can be 15 minutes for a party of 2-4 and 30 minutes for 5-8.  Service began slow (waited 10 minutes for our order to be taken), but picked up after our order was submitted.  On an irritated note, our waitress tried to nickel and dime us with three $4 sharing fees (we ordered 5 entr\xc3\xa9es for 8 people), then claimed that she was being nice because she was supposed to charge the $4 sharing fee for all 8 of us (yes, making that $32; is she out of her mind??).  After we exuded our frustration with the matter and indicated that we had ordered 3 of their $15 Frrrozen Hot Chocolates, she decided to be nice and "take care it."  C\'mon lady... we weren\'t born yesterday.\n\nFood Quality / Selection:\nThe food here is mediocre.  Their burger is big, but nothing spectacular.  We also had a sirloin steak sandwich on a large baguette.  Overall, the portions are on the bigger side and you\'re sure to get filled because most of the food they serve are heavy.  Presentation is average as well.  Take a look at their menu here: http://www.serendipity3.com/food.htm. \n\nPricing/Value/Convenience:\nOverall, I would say that this restaurant has poor value given the price they charge for the quality of the food, the type of food they serve, their overall service, and the crowded (almost cafeteria/fast food-like) atmosphere.  It\'s okay if you\'re here just to check it out, but I could recommend many better restaurants to go to.  It\'s centrally located right on the Strip, so just valet your car at Caesar\'s Palace and walk on over!'

S'I avoided this place for a loooong time because it looks gimmicky...and any place that pimps a product THAT hard (they\'re always going on and on about the "frrrrozen hot chocolate") must be covering up for something.\n\nSo I finally went over and checked it out, and yes, it\'s totally gimmicky. The lines are long and the prices high. But if you are able to get a table on the Strip-facing patio, it\'s a great place to people watch! This alone makes it worth all the other crap. You\'re up high enough from the street that you can harass people without fear of repercussion -- the other comparable Strip-side patio, at Mon Ami Gabi, is a little too within striking distance of the hoi polloi for my taste.\n\nFoodwise, I had nachos and an alcoholic root beer float. Both were great, though not groundbreaking. I refused to try the frrrozen hot chocolate because, as mentioned, anything that needs to be pimped out THAT hardcore probably sucks!!!\n\nSummary: worth it for the excellent people watching...just make a reservation or check in at the hostess stand WAY in advance! (While you\'re waiting, have a drink in the adjoining awesome Spiegelworld Beer Garden, or go meditate at the equally awesome and confusing Brahma Shrine right in front of the restaurant.'

Although the restaurant and walk up area was empty, it took a half an hour to get our order.  We got the ice cream sundae and frozen hot chocolate.  It was pricey and way too sweet.  I understand that the desserts here are supposed to be super rich and decadent, but this was overkill to the point that it was inedible.  We probably ate a quarter of our order and threw the rest away.  Also, would it kill you guys to wipe down the outdoor seating once in a while?  Everything was sticky and attracting bugs.'

S'Serendipity means a "happy accident" or "pleasant surprise"; specifically, the accident of finding something good or useful while not specifically searching for it (according to Wikipedia).  And although there were awesome finds on the menu, there were a few disppointments as well. \n\nWhat you can definitely tell from their menu is that Serendipity 3 aims to please.  Their options for food and beverages are deliberately decadent, pushing the limits of comfort food beyond counting calories into a happy place close to Willy Wonka\'s chocolate river.  The place also envelopes you in a quirky pink atmosphere.\n\nWe had the $30 jumbo lump crab entree for appetizers, and though steep, was worth every dollar.  Huge chunks of (what tasted like fresh) crab in a good mustard seed sauce.  The onion rings were huge (and that\'s about it), I\'ve had better, way better.  The ahi tuna salad would\'ve really rocked if the ahi was larger and of better quality.  The ABC burger with brie cheese, avocado and caramelized onions seemed so great in theory, and I don\'t know if we just received a bad execution.  The burger was dry, inspite of the luscious toppings.  \n\nAnd finally, the frozen hot chocolate came to our table. My eyes and my mouth were drooling.  I closed my eyes as I took my first sip and... and it tastes like a regular chocolate milkshake.  Sigh, the pitfalls of having high expectations.  I dunno, I was expecting something more.. frozen? More chocolate goodness? But what I had was a melted version of a milkshake.. that came in a larger, prettier package.\n\nSo all in all, we enjoyed and perhaps this review really suffered from high expectations.  Oh, and the fact that they didn\'t have rest room in the restaurant.  My husband said he had to share the public toilet with some bums shaving their beards.  Will we go back?  Maybe when we\'re really parched and in the mood for crab cakes.  I\'ll invest  my $12 in other chocolate milkshakes.  Or a martini.'

All the other dishes ordered in the 2 consecutive days that we went (mac \'n cheese, "one-eyed" jack, footlong hot dog with condiments, sweet potato fries, coleslaw) were pretty solid. The bill does make your eyes pop out a little but the meal leaves you pretty satisfied.\n\nTrue story: Made my own frozen hot chocolate by melting Ghirardelli chocolate in milk and put it in the freezer. Tastes a lot better and smoother and I spent less than $5 to make it.\n\nIt\'s been more than 2 weeks since I\'ve been here and I still wish I got a different dessert. *sips frozen hot chocolate*'

It was probably enough food to feed a starving family.\n\nThe crab and artichoke dip was done quite well with large pieces of crab meat.  The dish was well-plated and came looking like a million bucks.\n\nInfamous frrrozen hot chocolate -- delicious and just as good as I remembered from vising the NY store a few years back.\n\nPizza - served on a wooden paddle, it looked ginormous when it arrived.  They did a poor job slicing the pizza into manageable pieces.  \n\nPrice:\nThings seem a bit overprice when you view them on the menu.  $15 for an omelet? However, when you see the portions arrive you soon realize you are actually getting your money's worth.\n\nOverall:\nI really enjoyed my time here.  Not sure if it was the good company, the good service, the good food, or all of the above.  I probably won't eat a full meal here next time im in town, but will return for their desserts."

I'm not sure if the place is dirty but there was a dead bug in my friend's water. UGH! \n\nthe food is pretty expensive. i ordered the BLT Turkey sandwich for $16.99.  Huge portion but i dont think it was worth $16.99! ah! the meat was VERY salty and so were the fries. Of course we just had to order their signature frozen hot chocolate. VERY EXPENSIVE! 1 cost around $9 something and there was 5 of us so we ordered 2 for $13 each and shared it. it was HUGE. Overloaded of whipped cream and a few chocolate sprinkles.  the drink tasted very diluted because of all the ice.  for me, it just tasted like a diluted frappuccino.

I've seen this featured on Tv many many times thats why I decided to try out Serendipity 3 and I loved the movie as well. \n\n Although, I didn't order the opulence I tried their ABC Burger Avocado, Brie and Caramelized Onions. The patty itself was very flavorful so add the freshness from the avocado, the creaminess from the brie and the sweetness from the onions.... Simple but explosion of good flavors. I absolutely loved that burger. I also just had my wisdom teeth pulled so technically I shouldn't be eating a burger yet but I couldn't resist. I also ordered sweet potato fries with my burger and it was DIVINE! I'm not a burger person but I do have cravings once in awhile and this definitely did it for me. We also tried the Chilli Cheese Dog, for $15 it's nothing special just the dog being 3 times thicker than a usual dog, probably should have tried something else.\n\nLove the decor!

S'Average. Their selling point is their "Frozen Hot Chocolate", which looked way too big and a waste of calories drinking down what essentially seems like a chocolate milkshake to me.  So while it looked appealing, it was 8:30 pm at night and my friends & I were just looking for dinner at that point.  \n\nThere was absolutely no space that night (Sunday night) and so they suggested we ordered in their outside stand.  We therefore proceeded to do that and by the time we got there, they sold NOTHING.  There were no hotdogs, no sandwiches, no salads, no anything.  Anything we asked for on the menu, they said, "we don\'t have it".  Finally, frustrated, we ordered a bbq chicken pizza and some nachos.  Everything was just average.  The pizza actually had way too much bbq sauce it was a bit overbearing and the crust was way too doughy.  The nachos were just drizzled in cheese whiz and something I could have totally made myself.  \n\nI\'m now looking at their real restaurant menu and it appears as though they may have more variety inside the shop.  Maybe I\'d give it another try the next time I go to Vegas, but likely not as there are lots of other good things to eat in Vegas.  \n\nThe restaurant itself looked pretty cute...lots of Hello Kitty.'

The decor will keep you talking.  It has a cute-old-fashioned-ice-cream-parlor-had-a-kid-with Alice-in-Wonderland kind of look and feel.  The service was alright.\n\nThe strange:  They really, really need to tell you that everything on the dang sit-down menu is actually made for 2-3 people to share, I kid you not!  The food that was brought to the table made even the heartiest of eaters in our group stare in disbelief.  I think only one of us finished what we ordered, and that was on a bet.\n\nI'm not sure what the draw is to this place, maybe it's the frozen chocolate I was too full to try or the fairly uncrowded breakfast window.

I already knew I was going to get a frozen hot chocolate and I decided to try their ABC burger. This was the avocado, brie and caramelized onion burger...(Can you say YUMMMM!!!). I was a huge burger and I had to break the burger up because it was so huge! I was in love with the bun! It was a one of a kind bun with a very soft texture and sweet taste. I never really thought of ever putting brie on my burger but I guess I will now!!! \n\nThe serve was a hit. Our waitress made sure we were taking care of, was uberly nice and made recommendation. I enjoyed having her as my waitress. \n\nYou would think that from the sound of my review they should be receiving 5 stars but what knocked it down was my donut! So I was happy on tuesday but when I came back friday to get a donut (I am not asking for much....just a big giant donut!) I was welcome by an unfriendlier staff members that didn't really seem to want to help me until I was finally helped by the bartender. Everyone kept telling me to go outside the to go bar to get it but...it was 11:10 and they were still not opened....not cool! Luckily the bartender grab me the donut form the back.  \n\nOverall, depending on the day, the service can be either a hit or a miss. The food was pretty good for me to return. If you're a chocolate lover...go try the frozen hot chocolate!"

S"Frozen Hot Chocolate. MMM. \n\nYes, yes, and yes. \n\nHot dog combo platter. Yes. \n\nService? Yes! Great staff, even when busy. And they DO get busy. \n\nThey have a decent amount of seating, and some outside, which is not so desirable in the Summer, unless you are a lizard, or Satan. \n\nThey have a walk up window too. Cute place and walkable from mid-strip. \n\nI've taken friends who visit Vegas and we love the huge portions, we get a few apps and split it. The prices are not terrible. It is what you would expect from a strip location, but not too crazy. \n\nGive it a whirl, and if you do, be sure to try the Frozen Hot Chocolate!"

S'Stopped by for dinner because I was curious to try it out. \nOrdered the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Lobster Artichoke Dip and Carrot Cake Sundae. \n\nOut of all of these my favorite was the dip. It was creamy and stayed consistently hot for a long duration of time as we ate it. The dip didn\'t ball up or string up. Hard to keep my hands off of the bite sized bread slices that came with the dip because they were delicious!\n\nThe pizza on the other hand was a lot spicier than we had expected. Tons of cheese and I found myself scraping off some of the cheese. The blu cheese crumble added some flavor to the otherwise large mass of mozzarella. \n\nEnded with the sundae and was satisfied. I had thought they would mix in the carrot cake with the ice cream but it was simply a smack dab piece of carrot cake balanced on top of the sundae. It tasted good but I felt as if I could make it at home. \n\nOverall our service was good, but one thing I was surprised about was how the interior of the restaurant seemed "cafeteria-ish". Painted concrete floor. Very echo-ey so it was hard to hear when conversing. \n\nI\'m glad I tried this place but it\'s a one time thing.'

S"I have gone here a total of four times over the course of a year. \n\nI would say that's four times too many. \n\nThe customer service here is garbage. I can guarantee that you will experience any of the following: \n\n1) Your server will forget about you. \n2)You will be forced to harass a bus boy to order your food or get the check. \n3) The servers/ bartenders working there telling you things about their menu that are NOT great \n\nTheir entrees are generic main stream dishes that are comparable to an ordinary TV dinners, but for quadruple the price. Same goes for the appetizers.\n\nIf you wanted to go here because you think it's a cute place to visit, do NOT sit inside. I get that it's Vegas, and they want you in a partying, happy mood, but does it need to be at the noise level they blare the music at? Sure, the inside is still cute and quaint, but outside is just as nice.\n\nOn the flip side, their desserts are pretty good. You can't go wrong with the sundaes and shakes, and the portions are very pleasing. I love the frozen hot chocolate, although the bartender blatantly told me he thinks it's a waste of money and nothing special D: \n\nIf you ABSOLUTELY MUST eat here, just do NOT order any of the entrees. Just order their desserts. Just come here after dinner and you and sit outside so you can still keep your hearing. They have fans outside so it's not so bad when it's hot."

S'This place is both fancier and simpler than it seems. Fancier because it serves complicated drinks at sky-high prices, and the food is mighty expensive, too.  Simpler,because it looks like a cafeteria, the chairs are uncomfortable, the tables are tiny, the food is pedestrian, and deserts are simple but big.  Everything on the menu was huge, and smothered in cheese, or mayo, or chocolate, or whipped cream.  Or a combination of the above.  \n\nYet, underneath the breading and a heavy helping of mayo-based sauce, the crab cakes I got there were the best crab cakes found on the strip (for under a $100/meal, anyway).  And the silly-looking cotton candy martini turned out to taste pretty good and not overly sweet.'

S'Does anyone remember that scene from "The Simpson\'s Movie" where Ned Flanders makes that super sexy hot chocolate and gives it to Bart? Well guess what y\'all? I had that super sexy hot chocolate!!! The frozen version of it! I\'ve been wanting to try this place forever.  I went in New York awhile back, but the nearly 3 hour wait caused me to leave.  So, I tried it in Las Vegas! Situated on the strip, in front of Caesar\'s Palace, it\'s a great location.  Excellent people watching opportunities.  We had dinner elsewhere, so we only opted for dessert here.  They are pretty pricey, but the servings are massive.  More than enough to share.  We sat at the bar, the server was friendly and poured us glasses of iced water as soon as we sat down.  My husband and I decided to share the frrozen hot chocolate, ($16) and our friend got the banana split.  The server told him that he should probably get the smaller size of the banana split, since the one he opted for was massive.  He was right! When he got the small size, it was still the biggest banana split ever.  Everything was incredibly delicious. \n\nThe only reason I\'m docking a star is because our friends wanted coffee, but were told they would need to go inside themselves and order coffee as he can\'t make it in that area.  So, they went inside and were told by the employee inside that the server should have actually gone in and ordered it for them. Hmm. Also, about halfway through our visit, there was suddenly an odd smell at the outside area.. The place is right on the strip so it could have been coming from there, but regardless..it was kind of gross, and I\'m glad we were pretty much done by the time it appeared.'

S'Save yourself the terrible service, overpriced food, and awful experience, and go somewhere else. Definitely not worth it, especially if there is a wait. \n\nAfter waiting nearly an hour to get our food after we placed our order, our food came out. I would have been willing to give this place 2 or 3 stars if the food was at least half decent, but it wasn\'t. Our burgers were extremely dry, the chicken satay wraps were tasteless and cold, and my sister\'s fries were dry and stale. I was hoping that after the long wait, at least our food would be good, but it seemed like it had just been sitting out forever. \n\nFrozen Hot Chocolate: \nMy best advice would be to skip their frozen hot chocolate and instead, go to Godiva and get their frozen Dark Chocolate Decadence shake. It tastes better and costs less than half the price. We got the frozen hot chocolate to go because we wanted to get out of the place. The frozen hot chocolate is good, but definitely not worth $11. Each of us took a few sips and that was all we needed before throwing it away. And trust me, it was not because we were full. \n\nThis was the closest I have ever come to walking out of a restaurant. Our server, Robert or something like that, was probably one of the worst servers I have ever had. My entire family works or has worked in the restaurant/service industry so we usually give servers the benefit of the doubt, but this guy was unacceptable even to our standards. He gave us a bunch of attitude and was not attentive at all. At one point, it was taking so long for our food to come out that my mom asked him to cancel our order. But he told us, "Oh, but it\'s right there, I can see it". I had a direct view of the kitchen and there was nothing on the counter... but we decided to be nice and say ok. Fast forward 15 minutes later... still no food. He intentionally avoided our table during that entire time and was not apologetic at all. I think he may have said sorry once but it was the least genuine and most condescending "sorry" I have ever heard. \n\nTo end on a happy note, the decor is really cute. Reminds me of an old school ice cream shop.'

My husband ordered the meatball flatbread pizza, and LOVED it.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered something amazing.  Wait for it...it was...a deep fried oreo sundae.  It had fried oreos, ice cream, marshmallow fluff, whipped cream, hot fudge, and 18 levels of amazingness all in one large bowl.  I can't even describe to you how delicious this thing was!!

The decor was beautiful and it was roomy and spacious! My friends and I had the chicken fettucini with chicken, pot pie, and the burger with brie and avocado. We were all fans of our food!

S'I have mixed feelings about this place -- not sure it lives up to the hype.\n\nFirst, the atmosphere is very girly.  I think it is supposed to look a little like a soda fountain, but there is a little too much pink and "Hello Kitty" stuff.\n\nThe prices are Las Vegas crazy -- like $17 for a hot dog or $12-15 for an ice cream sundae.  I have eaten dinner there before, but its really not worth the prices that you pay.\n\nThe desserts, however, are quite good -- although still overpriced.  The sundaes are really the draw for this place, with lots of interesting choices.\n\nIf you really like ice cream, give this place a try -- but expect to drop some cash.'

S'The frozen hot chocolate wasn\'t bad, but not worth all of the hype, especially not for $12. I would have liked them to have blended the drink a little more, and it\'s extremely sweet so the whip cream is necessary to balance it out. I got the "regular", which was the smaller of the two sizes that they had. I even shared the frozen hot chocolate with my sister and I wish I could have gotten HALF of the "regular". The Buffalo wings were decent.  The ABC burger wasn\'t anything special ; the avocado on the burger wasn\'t that fresh. \n\nThe atmosphere is cute, and I liked the view of Las Vegas Blvd from the window.

S"good! and LOUD.  the place is cute.  decor is super girly... but the portions are manly for sure. I had the hangover omelet and was full from only a quarter of the portion.  truly a mix of goodness: fries, cheese, mushrooms, and bacon wrapped in an egg.  genius.  \n\nthe  menu had clever names and a wide variety, so it takes about 10  minutes to read what exactly is in everything.  it's probably good to get an idea before you go.. from what i've read before we went, sometimes service is slow [which i'm assuming is based on how busy it is..] luckily we went on a not so busy day. \n\nhusband had the ahi which was also excellent.  the serving of tuna filled him up, and the plate was majority rice pilaf mixed with sweet onions.  sweet potato fries are also a must try... which is served with most plates.\n\nso getting to the point.. I had a black and white sundae.  half chocolate half vanilla.. whipped cream with white chocolate shavings.. chocolate syrup, and a strawberry tuxedo.. [chocolate made to look like a tux] covered strawberry.. best part.  otherwise, it's a big ass bowl of ice cream.  big deal.  \n\nBUT I also had a bite of the deep fried oreos which was pleasantly not so much oreo-e then I thought. I don't know everything in that.. but the Oreo was dope. \n\nso the main main point.. food food is good.  :) deserts were typical... you can make crazier things at home [which i have] .. or at  yogo bar for cheaper."

My wife tried the crab and asparagus dip. It arrived cold. It was not edible so we complained and they microwaved it to heat it up. Seriously, they made the cardinal sin by microwaving it! I ordered sweet potato fries. They were horrible - couldn't eat more than one as they were overcooked and tasted like rubber. Deserts look to be their specialty, and that is all they should serve. Way overpriced for really bad food. \n\nBottom line, go for the deserts and to be with the trendy crowd but remember I warned you about the food."

We had lunch and here and weren't prepared at all for the portions and deliciousness. The sandwich I got was basically a caprese salad on bread...but better. The sweet potato fries that came with it were also among the best I'd had. The sandwich was the size of my forearm so I only had about half, but it justified the $12ish price tag. \n\nI love this place and will make sure to visit each time I head back to Vegas.

They have an extensive dessert menu, and all kinds of variations on their frrrozen hot chocolate.  That is really the only reason to go. \nOur food was meh. We ordered a crab/artichoke dip, a chicken sandwich, and my kids ordered spaghetti with meatballs and chicken fingers. \nThe dip wasn't great, but I liked that it had large chunks of real crab. It was too runny and bland, and I know that I can make a better version at home. The chicken sandwich was ok, but the fries were tasty. \nThe kids chicken fingers were freshly battered - pretty good. The spaghetti was actually a pappardelle pasta, which was good, but the meatball were undercooked!  So gross!\nWith so many other options, I wouldn't try this place again.

From my point of view, I noticed that this location is not well kept. You can definitely see the wear/tear of the restaurant. It felt dirty out on the patio and I would have preferred to be seated inside, as I noticed random patrons taking seats in the patio area. The desserts came 15 minutes later and we noticed that the bread pudding probably sat in the window for a while. That is, our topping of ice cream was completely melted by the time it reached the table.\n\nService was non-exisitent as well as the waiter hardly came by to check on us. \n\nOverall, I was let down by Serendipity.

S'Fattymax recommended to try this place as she has heard about the one in New York.  So we decided to give it a shot to see what the fuss was about.  The frozen hot chocolate seemed to be what everyone goes there for but unfortunately I wanted to try something different so we ended up getting the Buffalo Chicken Pizza, Crab Artichoke Dip, and the Carrot Cake Sundae, topped off with a pint of Sierra Nevada.  The service was good but the prices are steep.  The food came out relatively quickly, which I kind of had second thoughts about but we were so hungry that it was welcomed.  The pizza was pretty big, containing about 5 huge slices, enough for 2 people but i can see how a single hungry person can devour it.  The buffalo sauce was pretty spicy and the added blue cheese definitely is a must.  The crab artichoke dip was tangy but it was a big portion.  Lastly the sundae...I can say we were in for more than we bargained for.  It was a huge piece of carrot cake on top of vanilla ice cream topped with frosting.  It was so large that by the time we got to the ice cream portion, it had already melted (which was a bummer).  I felt that for the price we paid ($56) I would want smaller portions so that i can enjoy the dish, rather than trying to race through before the ice cream melted.  Go for the frozen ice chocolate, but you can find better food for better pricing on the strip.'

S'I first found out about this place through a movie... Serendipity.  Then my girlfriend tells me that there happens to be a new chain that recently opened in Las Vegas.  So there we were taking a mini vacation in Las Vegas and decided to drop on by.  The atmosphere was nice as it had this diner-type vibe.  As busy as they were, we were still seated right away.  For those that want take out... they also have windows that you can order from on the side.\n\nThe service was great!  Our waitress was very friendly.  She took the time to go over the menu with us when we asked for a recommendation.  And when we ordered our food... we ordered something on the side, but when it arrived it wasn\'t exactly how we asked.  She took notice and immediately made the change before we could say anything.\n\nThe food was great and the portions were definitely filling.  We even had enough to take back to the hotel for a later snack.  We had the rock shrimp appetizer (can\'t go wrong with shrimp) and ordered a single chili cheese dog to share.  This thing was no regular sized hot dog in a regular sized bun.  It was pretty big... (that\'s what she said).  But really... this chili dog with a side of fries definitely does the job.  Let\'s not get too carried away on the portions \'cause what good is a lot of food if it tastes like crap?  No worries here.  It was definitely good.  Toward the end of our meal we had the frrrozen hot chocolate (for free, courtesy of The Flamingo).  Imagine a "hot" chocolate on ice, with whipped cream and sprinkled bits of chocolate, topped with a bit of awesomeness.  If this drink isn\'t slap-you-in-the-face good, I will gladly do it for you.\n\nFor the good service, good food, and nice atmosphere... I give Serendipity five stars.'

S'Came to Serendipity twice while on vacation in Vegas with my European honey and I can say it didn\'t live up to our expectations on our first visit so we went again hoping that we\'d enjoy it more the second go around. Sadly, we didn\'t.\n\nOn our first visit we got the White Chocolate Frozen Hot Chocolate to share which was good, but not worth the $11 price tag. Next we each got BBQ & Blue Burger which was flavorless and had insufficient BBQ sauce on it. This visit receives 2 stars.\n\nOn our second visit (we were drunk) we got the All In Nachos and Pepperoni & Sausage Pizza. The nachos look delicious, but they taste so-so. I was really bummed that they just put melted cheese on the nachos instead of using nacho cheese (cheese whiz). Also, the chips underneath the top layer were pretty much missing all of the "All In" toppings so we were just eating plain chips. Thankfully, the Margherita Pizza was good so kicked the nachos to the side and feasted on the pizza. This visit receives 2 stars as well.\n\nIf you want to try Serendipity I recommend coming after you\'ve had a few drinks so you won\'t be pissed off about dropping $70+ dollars on a so so meal.'

S"The bad:  I was waiting in line at the host stand (for about 5 minutes) and they never looked at me and then asked the people behind me if they had been helped and they jumped in front of me. I told her that I had been waiting and she didn't care! Seriously, your servers are awesome, your food is good but your host stand people need some help on customer service. \n\nThe food took a long time for it to come out and it wasn't that hot (but I was sitting outside so it might have just gotten cold from the outside temp) but like I said the server was awesome and made up for it. Plus, I wasn't in a hurry so it didn't really bother me.  So, I'm not complaining about the food wait time but just thought I would mention it in case you have plans after dining.  \n\nThe GOOD: I had an awesome server and the food was good. \n\nI will be back and this time I will call ahead and a make reservation so I can avoid issues with the host stand.\n\nI would love to try something different like maybe the grilled cheese and tomato soup and the Oreo frozen hot chocolate. \n\nI had the crab dip and man that has a ton of crab and can be shared for sure!  Also, had the mint frozen hot chocolate which was awesome."

S"There's the actual dine in place and also an area outside where you could order food.  The first time I ordered the frozen hot chocolate (from outside), it was amazing!! The second time I ordered it, it was just okay.  Tasted more like ice.  If you order from outside, they give it to you in a plastic cup, but if you order inside, the presentation is pretty and it costs a little more.\n\nTo dine in,  I gave my phone number to the hostess and she was able to text me when my table was ready.  I found this convenient, and the wait was only 15 minutes long.  It took quite a long time for our food to come out, but I understand that the kitchen was busy.  Our server was very friendly and accommodating.\n\nI went on a Sunday morning and Brunch is served until 2am.  You can't order off the regular menu.  Dessert was also being served.\n\nI ordered the fried eggs benedict.  It was alright but I wasn't completely satisfied with it.      The egg is kind of hard boiled.  I was hoping for it to have more sauce.  The biscuit was good but it was lacking in the other sauces so it made it seem a little dry.  \n\nFor desert, I got the can't say no sundae.  I LOVED it.  The humble pie in it is yummy and rich in flavor.  It goes well with the ice cream."

S'I came there last summer for  my Fiance\'s Birthday in July after watching Phantom of the Opera. We were served by a gentlemen by .. I believe his name is Lance. After making our  drink and food orders. I saw the staff singing happy birthday to a little girl. I then asked Lance if his staff could do the same for my fiance since it was his birthday. He told me he was going to see what he could do. So after having our dinner we got our frozen hot chocolate. And I flagged lance down and asked why they didn\'t sing happy birthday.. ... he said he didn\'t do it for anyone no older then 12 yrs old! I was like (WTF) are you serious?! He then goes on to say "you can sing him happy birthday and I can give you a candle" So when he got the candle he yelled out "everybody lets hear it for this guy it\'s his birthday today! and said "now you can sing him happy birthday" and walked away! My fiance and I looked at each other like omg! Seriously WTF was that? I would have given him ANY STARS! On our way out of Las Vegas we had called the next morning to complain to a manager to let him know what happened and Mike told my fiance that Lance tends to do what he wants at night but he was still supposed to accommodate us for what we wanted (So basically he refused to do that service for me! what a Jerk! ) and Mike apologized and told us to come in that night for a complementary dinner on the house. My fiance told him we were about to board a plane to go to CA. at the time. So Mike said the next time we were be in town to Look him up! ... So in October of last year we went back and spoke to a fairly new manager and told him of our experience and gave us a great server by the name of Lori. She was very helpful in helping us decide which foods were good, and she was from were we originally were from was San Jose, CA. She knew exactly what mall my fiance and I worked at and what area it was in! How cool was that! She did a way better job than Lance did tending to our needs and always checked up on us to see if we were doing OK. That\'s the kind of customer service that people should always get which is the reason why I gave 3 stars.'

S'Sat immediately upon arriving, which is nice, but it took a good 10 minutes before someone even came over and once the waiter did come over, it seemed like he was over serving people. Lack luster attitude with a side of sarcasm to put it lightly. If your waiters are overwhelmed and need a few minutes to catch up, I would MUCH RATHER wait for a table an extra 10 minutes than to be sitting a table waiting for someone to acknowledge me for 10 minutes. \n\nFood - way over priced. I know their "sliders" (appetizer) are expected to be small, but DAMN! They were literally the size of the ramekin that came with them filled with ketchup. And for 12$? C\'mon now...\n\nBut the kids ate them and the only good part of that dish was the bacon aoili, yum! Fries were crunchy and good. The only enjoyable part of the whole meal was the frozen hot chocolate and I wouldn\'t mind paying $15 for the two serving if it wasn\'t more than half whipped cream on top. Yeah it looks pretty, but way to rip off your customers. Once in a while, OKAY.. but I mean once in a blue moon because the walks ridiculously far unless you\'re already walking the strip and it\'s really only enjoyable for dessert. I\'d suggest ordering at a takeout window right out front of the restaurant and seat yourself. Save yourself the hassle.'

S"Vegas is practically my second home since I come here at least once a year. For the past two years, I've been eyeing Serendipity as I passed it driving down the strip; the exterior is cute and decorated with huge frozen hot chocolates. I finally got around to trying the famous Serendipity and my experience was not at all what I had expected.. in a not so great way.\n\nMy good friend and I arrived a little after 9PM. We were given a wait time for 30-40 minutes. We were having such good conversation that I failed to even keep track of how long it had been. When our pager finally buzzed, we were led to the outdoor seating overlooking the strip. What I first noticed was the many empty tables. I guess they were just understaffed? Anyway, we sat down at an average looking table. For some reason I had pictured this place to be extremely cute and a lot more.. New York-ish? \n\nOur server took what felt like ages to even take our order and when he finally arrived at our table, he didn't seem enthusiastic at all. We ordered the large frozen hot chocolate for 2, which was $15. We both took a sip of the frozen hot chocolate at the same time and probably had the same surprised look on our faces. We were very disappointed with the quality of the ever so famous drink. It tasted no more like melted ice cream or even a super icy milkshake. My friend ordered what I believe was some sort of turkey sandwich, which was $17. The portion was decent. I didn't try the sandwich but the sweet potato fries weren't anything great.\n\nI will definitely be back in Vegas but definitely not returning to Serendipity. Hype is hype but sometimes you gotta see it to believe it and in this case, don't believe the hype. Save your time and $15 and get a milkshake from Coldstone."

S'We came here for brunch on a weekday, and there was a relatively long wait (30 minutes?) considering that about half of the tables, inside and out, were empty, and there were members of the wait staff standing around.  The hostess was sort of rude, and acted like she was doing us a favor by taking our name.  \n\nOnce we were seated, we ordered the famous frozen hot chocolate (the "for 2" size), which was ok but nothing amazing... it tasted a bit like a thin milkshake made with  pre-made powdered hot chocolate mix (which, in retrospect, is probably exactly what it was).  I ordered the French toast with berries, bacon and egg.  The French toast was burnt, but everything else was good.  The berries were fresh, the bacon was almost strangely good, the breakfast potatoes were a little oily but had a good flavor, and the egg was fine.  My husband ordered the blueberry pancakes, which were good.  Both portions were absolutely enormous, and we wished that we had shared a dish rather than getting two.  \n\nThe service was adequate, but not good.  The waitress was efficient, but did not engage or interact with us at all.'

S'Not really sure what all the fuss is about this place. When we went it was absolutely packed to the rafters, complete with a 30 minute wait for a table.\n\nThe food wasn\'t bad - my bacon burger was decent, as was my wife\'s triple decker grilled cheese (with variety of cheeses). Both tasty (not amazing), without being worth anywhere close to the hefty price tag.\n\nWhere Serendipity 3 fell apart for me was in the atmosphere. The place is tiny, overcrowded and the wait staff are impatient, harried and DO NOT LISTEN. I tried to explain something specific that I wanted and our waitress seemed to be on complete autopilot as she tried to finish my thought for me without having any idea what I was talking about. Eventually I just gave up and hoped for the best (I didn\'t get what I had asked for).  Wife\'s Grilled Cheese was supposed to come with soup and a choice of chips or fries. Waitress insisted she couldn\'t have both, despite the menu clearly listing soup as coming with the grilled cheese (most likely so they can justify their price for what is, after all, just a grilled cheese) by default and an "all burgers and sandwiches are served with chips or fries" note at the top of the section.\n\nPerhaps we should have tried some of the things that people rave about here like the frozen hot chocolate, but our experience was one of mediocrity.'

I ordered the strawberry milkshake and the spicy penne pasta with huge uncut prosciutto and mozzarella laid over the top, and my gf ordered the wood grilled salmon item (I think it's the only salmon featured item in the menu). \n\nSo now it's been three days and I can't stop thinking about the milkshake. The pasta on the other hand was so much that I couldn't even try to finish half of it after sharing a caesar salad with my gf.  I didn't think much of the salmon but my gf ended up finishing her meal completely.\n\nThe biggest thing to take note of this place is that food comes in larger than expected portions.

Coming to Pho Kim Long...yah i was intoxicated...so I should love the food even more right? For me, it was a No. I was satisfied (but not too satisfied), it was just A-OK, and I was starving like a hungry hippo.\n\nService was great though, but the food was just A-OK for me.\n\nUNTIL THEN!! ^-^'

S"Vietnamese and Chinese food under one roof!  Before moving to Las Vegas I never thought a place existed.  However, some of my cousins/family friends from the Midwest that frequent Las Vegas introduced me to this restaurant and it has become a staple in our quest for great food!\n\nA couple things I love to get:\n\nCubed Steak w/ Chinese Broccoli\nSalt and Pepper Calamari:  Lightly battered w/ slivers of jalapenos\nHouse Pan Fried Noodles\nAny of the Pho Combinations\n\nThe place it self is very nice.  Furniture and decor are new.  However, you may never find this place quiet because it's always crazy busy and open late.  The waiters are characters.  If you are looking for a friendly waiter that will ask you if you would like to hear the specials this might not be for you.  But I give this place 4 starts and we keep coming back for more.  Also, they have imported Asian beers!  Get a beer and some fried Calamari...yum oh!"

Mind you, it was 110 degrees outside and people were still waiting like they were giving something away for free. \n\nI should have gone for the pho but I've had my share in college when I live in Orange County. Instead, I opted for the bahn mein which was not the best I've ever had. It was quite mediocre as I've had better elsewhere.\n\nSince it was searing hot outside, I opted to get a mango smoothie with tapioca and was expecting fresh mangos for a $4.75 drink. Boy did they serve up a powered monstrosity which I took two sips of. I hate powdered drinks when fresh fruit should have been in order."

Hawaii is just as expensive, and people are gonna pay for it. At least I didn't pay for something that tasted like mess. One thing people don't understand is the broth is different to how you make it taste with the sauces they provide on the table. If you know how to mix your bowl, it will come out bomb.com! If you don't of course you're going to give this place a 1 star for being bland. -_- It's 24 hours, so it's great if you got a hangover, or feelin' way too drunk.

So I tell him to VOID the transaction and so my other friend comes to pay for it and we just all give her cash. I come home to check my bank statement and see that THEY HAVE BILLED ME FOR THE MEAL AS WELL! Im going to wait a few days to see if he really did void my transaction, but this is ridiculous! Usually when I void my order it shows in my bank statement right away.\n\nSo if you're coming in a big group, make sure everyone has cash because this place does not accept split checks! Better yet go elsewhere!\n\nFood quality is mehhh as well. Usually I LOVE pho and can eat the whole bowl but it just did not satisfy me as much as other restaurants.

I think due to the 24/7 hours, they've changed the way they make their food and it's no good. \n\nThe pho isn't good at all. The soup doesn't have the beef flavor in it at all, it just doesn't taste how pho should taste. \n\nThe service here sucks.

S'My friends and I came to Pho Kim Long to eat dinner around 8PM. Upon first impressions, I liked the decor of the restaurant. It was nicely decorated and roomy. We were also seated immediately. We all sat down, thought about what we wanted to order... 10 minutes had gone by after we were seated and no one came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink. A couple of minutes later, an older gentleman took our orders. My friend and I both ordered Pho Dat Biet (special combination tender beef noodle soup, $8.75), my boyfriend ordered half of the Ga Chien Gion (deep fried chicken with fried garlic, $13.95 for half chicken), and my other friend ordered Com Chien Tom (shrimp fried rice, $11.50). \n\nHere came the most disappointing part. I\'m not exaggerating when I say that 30 minutes had literally gone by before the first dish came out, and that was my boyfriend\'s deep fried chicken dish. I thought that this dish was pretty good. It wasn\'t too salty and I loved the fried garlic. Do note that this dish didn\'t come with rice so you would need to order it on the side. At this point, I\'m starting to look around the room hoping to catch the attention of the workers to see if they had brought out our dishes. 5 minutes after the fried chicken came out, both of the Pho Dat Biet came out. Honestly, I didn\'t think that it was too good. The broth wasn\'t anything spectacular and for the "special" bowl of Pho that we ordered, there was barely any beef, tripe, tendon, and all the other components that goes in the special. \n\nAt this point, my other friend who had ordered such a simple dish of fried rice STILL has not received has order. We started trying to track down the employees and finally managed to spoke to one about how we haven\'t received the last dish of fried rice. There was a couple who was sitting nearby us, who were seated way after we were seated and had managed to receive their food order BEFORE we even got ours! And how is it that the fried rice would be the last dish to come out? Makes no sense to me.... So about 10 minutes after both of the Pho dishes came out, my friend\'s fried rice finally came out. It didn\'t look too appealing either... He also mentioned that some of the parts in his fried rice were cold and not warm at all...\n\nI don\'t know what happened with our order honestly. Pho Kim Long is open 24 hours, which is great for people who want to grab a late meal after EDC, clubbing, etc ;]. Since Vegas is the city that never sleeps, I\'m sure many people there appreciate how late Pho Kim Long is opened. It\'s possible that at night, they don\'t have as many cooks in the kitchen or they simply forgot our order... who knows! I most likely wouldn\'t visit Pho Kim Long to eat again unless I desperately needed some soup or Pho late at night!'

S"The food is comparable to other good Vietnamese restaurant. I usually get the Pho Chin Nam (Brisket & Flank) and egg rolls. It's always busy. The service isn't always that great. For the most part, they get you your food and then leave you alone until you're ready to pay. They charged a 15% gratuity on a party of 7. I don't know many Vietnamese restaurants that charges gratuity. For the service that we received the last time we went there (in early July), the gratuity was undeserving. \nIf you have a hankering for Vietnamese food, this place will give you what you want.

S"During my college years, or at least those years I was 21+, I made several late night/early morning trips to Pho Kim Long.  Sometimes it was to feed post-clubbing munchies and at other times it was to nurse a post clubbing hangover.  Pho Kim Long was always one of the first Pho restaurants that popped up on Yelp when you searched it and in my less than 100% state I remember thinking it as pretty good.  But now that I'm a little bit older, wiser, and more sober when I eating here, it is more like 2.5 stars (I rounded up for the good blurry memories).\n\nA bowl of Pho is right around 7.50 which isn't cheap or crazy expensive.  You can pretty much order any combination of rare beef, tripe, tendon, meatball, etc. that suites your fancy.  They give you a very average portion of everything.  One of the things that stops me from giving them more stars is their broth.  I feel that it is all about the broth; it is what makes or breaks a bowl of Pho.  I just don't find their broth to have very much flavor like other places.\n\nAnother reason why I can't justify giving them more stars is because their service is on the slow side.  I've been there on more than one occasion and even though they have lots of room and should have figured out a way to handle to their customer flow, I still always find myself waiting for really long periods of time for my food.  I don't really order anything fancier than a bowl of Pho so it shouldn't take that long.\n\nI'm sorry Pho Kim Long. I want to like you more because of our history, but you are just another average Pho Joint and nothing special in my mind."

And 24 hours?!!\n\nComing off of the best pho I've ever had at Vietnamese Central in Westminster, Orange County, CA...  this place was flavorful, but not AMAZING.\n\n[=THE 411=]\nI'm assuming if you're a visitor, you'll come here either for cheap lunch or for a late-night, post-clubbing chow-down.  I think this place will do it for either one -- as long as you're craving pho.\n\n[=SERVICE/WAIT=]\nWe came in with a group of 10 for a late-ish lunch.  Parking wasn't too hard, even though the lot was pretty full.  They seemed pretty busy too, but we only had to wait 5 minutes or so to get seated, so that was surprising.  Waters came out quickly, so OK on the service.\n\n[=THE FOOD: PHO=]\nPho is definitely the thing to get -- cheapest for the most food.  I had one of the pho with three cuts of meat.  It was a little salty and I wish they had more noodles, but no other complaints.  I wish they had given more bean sprouts and basil for our large group, but I'm sure we could have asked and they would have gladly obliged.\n\n[=VERDICT=]\nI wouldn't go out of my way to eat here next time I visit Vegas unless I was specifically craving pho -- but chances are, I'll get something better/more expensive, or cheaper/closer.

S'Unbelievable. This place is a joke! The employees and manager are beyond ridiculous. \n\nHere is the story. My mother and I had gone right now and had ordered some food and one of the many foods we ordered was Chicken Pad Thai. When our dish came out and we ate couple chopstick full & looked at this so called "chicken" that was thinly sliced, chewy and what seemed and look like fat attached was simply "pork". \n\nLike any customers would, we called over our waiter, he took it back unsure as well than ANOTHER waiter aggressively came back with the dish and claimed it was chicken. We argued about this for several mins & because we didn\'t want to make a bigger scene we told him to take the dish back. \n\nNOW, this next part gets better. As we continue to eat our rest of the food, the waiter and his other employees gather around near by we were sitting and have the nerves to talk about our situation and laugh about it. So, as a customer I was furious. Asked for the manager to let him be aware of his employees behavior. Of course -_- manager isn\'t any better with his behavior so possibly that\'s why his employees aren\'t any better either -_- so anyways, manager comes to our table, not making any eye contact with me and fights for his employees (which is understandable defending his employees). Finally got an apology and ended the conversation. \n\nThis gets even better, once the check arrives, we were charged for Chicken Pad Thai (in most case in other restaurants, the dish is taken off the check) so we only paid for what we only ate and with that kind of a crappy service, we didn\'t leave tip. As we were leaving, the manager came out to our car and told us we didn\'t pay enough. This is how the conversation went:\n\nManager: "you didn\'t pay enough!"\nMe: "no, we paid for what we ate."\nManager: "shut up!"\n\nSo at this point, I was beyond furious and got out of our car and went up to him and he had the nerve to say he didn\'t tell me to shut up. So now I\'m apparently gone crazy and hearing things -_- then he aggressively argues with me that I didn\'t pay enough, so I had to RE-EXPLAIN to him that we ONLY paid for what we actually ate and not what was taken back (since we didn\'t eat it!). \n\nThis is where he failed miserably as a manager...not only did he verbally fight back, tell me to shut up, but he had his biggest nerves to tell me my service was unwanted there and for me to "go to hell". \n\nUhm, are you serious right now?! How in the world can a restaurant manager say all that to a customer?????!!!!!! My mind was so blown away. Un-freaking-believe-able! For sure NEVER going back there and it is such a disappointment cause I been going there for many years now. I seriously think they are so full of it!     \n\nThis doesn\'t even deserve a (1) star but I have to give something to leave a review...FML -_-'

S"This place is a convenient location on Spring Mountain not too far from the strip.  A great place to go after a night out.  The inside of the restaurant is pretty spacious and better looking than the outside... which isn't impressive and the parking is frustrating because of the extremely narrow parking lot (more like a parking strip).  I usually order #13 steak & brisket noodle soup.  Their meals are decent.  Not great, but still pretty good."

S"This is the place to go for some nice Pho noodle soup and classic Vietnamese food! I usually grade Pho noodle shops by a couple of things... First, the flavor and quality of the broth, it can't be too greasy, great deep color of the broth, nor too much MSG. Secondly, the quality of the meat! I usually get the combination, of tripe, tendon, and the rare beef . Lastly, the quality of, what I call the extras, i.e. Thai basil, white onions, bean sprouts, jalapenos, &etc. \n\nThe second dish I usually judge a Pho joint is by the quality of the spring rolls. Now, I've been to many places where the spring roll just plain sucked! It's hard to find a place that has all the elements of a good spring roll. i.e. the shrimp, not too over cooked. The pork, is it flavorful? Is the vegetables mushy? and the overall quality of the flavor, not too much vinegar, a slight touch of mirin, and of course the quality of the peanut sauce. Makes me hungry as I write this! This place hit all the mark! \n\nNow, let me say this, when a place is called Pho Kim Long...Pho soup is the way to go! Enjoy what they are known for! With that being said, the bowls of delectable Pho has to be one of the better ones in Vegas. It's not to say that the Banh Mi sandwiches are not bad, to be exact, it's actually pretty good! \n\nService is very prompted, friendly, and professional! Nothing negative to say about it at all!  \n\nPrice wise, it's great! Everything is pretty much under $10.00! Can't complain too much here! \n\nEnjoy! \n\n n ngon nh\xc3\xa9"

Prices here are a bit steep but I guess I don't mind eating here so I can take a break from all the other foods here.\n\nPho Dac Biet: mmm I like their noodles.  It's very nice and soft.  Okay meats.  Soup base was...not bad.  I felt the MSG a little bit past midway eating.  Plenty of veggies given (bonus!) and water is always provided :)  Overall, I would get it again.  But with a coke.\n\nWalnut Shrimp: really good.  Not too oily.  Delicious caramelized and crunchy walnuts.  I love the fact that the shrimp was so plump!  YUM!\n\nClean and contemporary atmosphere.

Didn't take any order for drinks or food.  Didn't even bother to properly seat us.  Just grabbed the menus and placed it on the table without telling us to follow.  When we asked if we were suppose to be seated, he gave a light nod so it was hard to tell what he wanted us to do.  His communication skills was lacking as if he didn't want us there.   After 15 minutes of being ignored, we left.  I don't know what their problem was but if you're going to open a restaurant until 5:30 am in the morning, you should treat all guest like they are wanted there.

S'It\'s a "high end" Pho restaurant.  The decor is nice inside, compared to all the countless  hole in the wall Pho places, but the food is lacking.  It is also open 24hrs, so if you are craving Pho at 300am, this place is open.\n\n  I started with the fresh spring rolls.  It was bland and tasteless.  The rice wrap was soft, so that is a plus, but even with the peanut sauce, it did not stand up to a good tasting fresh shrimp spring roll.\n\nI ordered the Bun Bo Hue.  It was actually pretty tasty.  You get to add the spice to it yourself, so the broth is to your liking.  Each bite had meat, tendon and they also included the pig knuckle (which I like in my Bun Bo Hue.)  I would order it again.  The noodles were thick and cooked right.  It was a good bowl of Spicy noodles, but for $9, it better be good.\n\nThe total bill was $15, a bit overpriced for an underwhelming experience.

We've seen the pretty girl that works there before, but this time when we went, we didnt see her.  We ordered, ate, then I went to go pee.

I was gonna let it slide and talk to pretty girl when we left, but big homie Bolo Eddie had to go see what was up with gumby, and thats when the managers got scared and started callin the mexis workin in the back to come in.  I went with him, so it killed my chance with talkin to homegirl :(\n\nSo my ratings are:\nFood: 4 - lots of meat, meatballs are pretty bomb\nService: NEGATIVE 5 - busboy, stick to refilling water and cleanin up dishes\nCleanness: 1 - not the cleannest place, we're not in viet anymore\n\nWell I'm bout to get off work now, so I'll end this.

The prices on the menu are overpriced, not even a late night mark-up. Even if I have to pay more, at least the food & service should be worth it. Its neither. I asked for a plate of white onions three times and never received my plate of white onions. The staff also failed to give me my correct change. \n\nThis place may be fit for after party goers and drunks. It's so apparent that there are 2-3 metro on site. I even had an officer direct me to my table. \n\nThere are plenty of other Pho restaurants I'd prefer over this one.

I thought it was just okay.  Pho wasn't entirely hot when I got it, which was disappointing. As others have mentioned, some foods taste like they were bought pre-packaged and not made in house. One of my companions is Vietnamese and came from a family of caterers, to boot.  He ripped the place a new one over the food - spices were off, dishes were not done properly, etc.  I was genuinely disappointed as I love all kinds of Asian food and wanted to really like this place.  Unfortunately, I think they've gotten a little big for their britches, they know folks are going to show up no matter what and just are phoning it in now. \n\nNow when I want pho I go down a few doors to Fat Dumpling - great pho with all fresh ingredients, no ridiculously long lines, and better price."

Pho broth is bland, food is overpriced in accordance to the price and the service is negligible. I do have to say however their Chinese food isn't half bad. Although I'd rather go to K.J. Kitchen for that. \n\nMaybe I'm just being an elitist, or am still bummed that this place used to be so good. Nonetheless, this place is nothing more than average by far. \n\nAhh, then I discovered Saigon 8."

The noodles were firm and everything was just delicious.  I would normally order pho thai rather than pho dac biet, but I was feeling like a fatty and went ahead with it.  \nThe wait staff were friendly and patient so that's always a plus.  The facility was CLEAN!!  Now, that's something you don't see very often in pho joints.\nI also ordered the che ba mau (three-color dessert) and it was just okay.  It was in a small cup and I was charged $3.50.  Kinda pricey, but, meh, I've had better.  I took my parents here (who grew up in Vietnam and are self-proclaimed pho connoisseurs) and they really liked the food.  Score!  I pat myself in the back. The only downside was that it's a little pricier (by $1 or $2) than what my family and I were used to paying compared to pho in LA .  A couple dollars may not seem as much, but it'll add up.  That aside, come here and enjoy the pho."

The broth was tasty, the proteins were good (I forgot what I ordered) and the serving size was also good.\n\nI guess my issue when I went there was that whenever the wait staff would give me my beverage or check, it was placed at the end of the table away from me, which I found to be unusual.  For example, since I ate lunch by myself, I had a single table that seats only two people.  The bev/check was actually placed at arm's length.  Is that a Viet thing?  I'm pretty sure it was the wait staff's perceived issue with me.\n\nBut, as I mentioned before, I'm moving to LV soon and willing to give these folks another go.

S'I have been coming to Pho Kim Long for about 7 years now and I\'m glad to see it gain popularity over the years.  I recently came here for a quick lunch on what I thought would be a quiet Tuesday afternoon.  I arrived at 2pm and it was jam packed!  They have won some "best of" awards and that has really helped their business.  But with popularity comes the price increases!! Hey, it\'s a business and they want to make money so I get it.  \n\nThey updated their menu with pricing and graphics, but the dining room is still the same.  \n\nWhat I like about this place is that they don\'t mess around.  You definitely don\'t come here for the customer service, because at Pho Kim Long customer service is non-existent. You come here for the delicious Pho.  I always get the plain noodle Pho.  For $6, you can\'t beat the price.  Sodas are $3 though.... Kinda high.  \n\nThey are very fast and efficient and always refill your water without you having to hunt down a waitress.  Food comes out when it comes out, so don\'t expect them to course it out for you.\n\nSIDEBAR.....Their egg rolls are also one of my favorite things to get.\n\nIf you\'re in the mood for some Pho and want a cheap place to go to with friends, come to Pho Kim Long.'

S"Overall:\nBeen here twice and of the 1001 pho places in Vegas, this one inches higher than the rest, but still isn't perfect.\n\nFood: I typically order pho with brisket, flank and tendon. Tendon is hit or miss in most Vietnamese places. Both times i've been here i've had issue with it, the first time i got one small piece and this last time i got several inedible hard chunks. The broth is quite good though. I also get a Vietnamese iced coffee. I am used to it coming in the drip brewer at the table and pouring it myself, its kinda fun, but here they brew it in the servers station and deliver it in a styrofoam cup. not a deal breaker, but i like doing it myself.\n\nService: Good. There is usually a wait to get in because of the popularity but there is ample serving staff and i never feel like i'm invisible or ignored.

All good food, but it seems like the prices of the food go up every year. The service isn't consistent. I come here maybe every other week for lunch and/or dinner. Sometimes the service is quick and on point. They kind of rush you so the next group of people can sit down, though. But, if the wait is 15-20 minutes long, at least let us sit down and enjoy our food for that long. Other times, even if business is slow, the service is slow and poor. Every time I've gone, my food always comes before my drink surely. My drink seems to always come when I'm half way done with my food whether I order a smoothie, tea, specialty drink, or coffee."

Spring rolls with no pork: I love these. Slightly smaller, but flavorful with sweet tender shrimp and the obligatory peanut dipping sauce. My bf wasn't too please but then again, he might have been eating in his sleep.\n\n2. Pho with flank and rare steak: The broth is the winner hear, flavorful and oily. The meat and noodle was standard. Nick said he prefers more and better meat, but I was more than pleased with the noodle and broth. \n\n3.

If you're a fan of Bobby Flay, you would pay a visit too.\n\nWe came without reservations and waited 20 minutes.  We tried our hand at gambling but failed miserably and walked away with $2.  Bobby Flay is the boy next door and is known for his crazy spicy tex-mex dishes.  This restaurant could use a face lift.  I didn't care for the primary colors and the decor but I wasn't here for the decor, just the food.\n\nBoy meets grill here indeed.  We got started with blue corn muffins and an appetizer of chicken tacos.  They were three tiny tacos but absolutely delicious and mouth watering.  The peanut BBQ sauce was delicious and had pieces of chopped peanuts that added a sweet touch to the tacos. Our main course was the Chile Rellano and Pork Tenderloin with a side of mashed potatoes. \n\nThe Pork Tenderloin was served with an ancho chile sauce that was hot and topped with a pecan butter sauce and plated with a sweet potato tamale.  My Chile Rellano was a chile stuffed with eggplant and cheese.  It was drizzled with sweet red pepper sauce and balsamic vinegar.  I don't really like eggplant but paired up with a chile and manchego cheese and a superb cornmeal crust; I was in heaven.\n\nThe mashed potato side was topped with a green chile queso sauce that was absolutely mouth watering. We devoured that as soon as it hit the table.  Our only wish is that the blue corn muffins were served warm but we can overlook that.\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert but we were licking our fingers after a superb 5 star meal.

The queso fundido is the best cheesiest thing I have ever had( common theme here) comes with blue corn tortillas. For my first course ordered the sweet potato soup (creamy, sweet and spicy), Second course ordered his famous green chile burger with seasoned fries (perfectly seasoned), for dessert was a lemony sorbet with fresh fruit oh so refreshing to cleanse the palatte( and yes slight spice in that sorbet not in a bad way) Overall, we all left this place so uncomfortably full, but my table all agreed by FAR this was the best lunch we had all ever had!!!

After becoming addicted to the Food Network's competition shows I was excited to eat at a Bobby Flay restaurant - and Caesar's is always fun to walk through.\n\nWe had 10:45 a.m. reservations for the Saturday brunch - it's our lunch hour our in our home time zone! We each ordered an appetizer. The Tiger Shrimp and Corn Tamale is worth writing home about - amazing flavors in this unconventional tamale. Also tried the Goat Cheese Queso Fundido as the suggestion of the waiter - another home run. I was in the mood for a burger so I got the Mesa Burger - very good, the grilled Vidalia onions were the secret to the taste for me. The fries were not as good as I had hoped, but by that point I was so full that was fine. My husband ordered off the specials - a six shrimp / two tortilla taco plate served with three sauces - a guacamole spread, mango puree and green tomatillo. We both liked the mango the best.

Nice and warm with the Southwest flair.  We were excited about the prospect of ordering dessert as well, however, the appetizers and the meal filled us up so perhaps next time we will order dessert first.  :)\n\nIt was an enjoyable time.  However, because of the volume of people in the restaurant it was a little hard to have a conversation."

S'I went to Vegas a couple of weeks ago and was treated to Mesa Grill by some friends.  This was the second time I had been to the restaurant, the first time being about 7 years ago.  I had fond memories of Mesa Grill from the past, but was slightly disappointed this time around.  Since I was not paying, I only ordered an entree, so I ordered the ribeye.  The meat was perfectly cooked to medium ( the server suggested this instead of medium rare)  ... it looked like medium rare to me anyway.  Perhaps, she was heading off some potential problem that the cooks might have been having with undercooking meat?  The steak was flavorful, but could have been accompanied with more of the sauces that came along side of it.  My only issue with the steak was that it did not come with accompaniments.  Every other entree selection (besides the filet) came with a side dish or tamale of some sort.  For $48, I expected something.  The waitress suggested that we order a couple of sides to split, so we got the corn and the spinach.  Both portions were TINY and really could not be split unless your idea of splitting them is a tablespoon serving per person.  Our waitress was very knowledgeable although a bit condescending... maybe that is not the best word...  over-confident perhaps?  Anyway, she was ok but kind of icy.  The others at my table had the veal chop and pork tenderloin.'

S"My friend and I decided to come here because another restaurant we couldn't enter because we were not 21 and for the fact that its Bobby Flay's restaurant. Thank goodness we came here because it was awesome! We came here for brunch and the staff all greeted us with warm smiles and immediately we were seated. We came in around brunch time so we had the brunch menu. I ordered the spicy scrambled eggs and my friend ordered the blue corn buttermilk waffles but before all this came an assortment of bread. All of the breads were warm, soft, and delicious! Both entrees  were outstanding. The ham egg and biscuits in the scrambled eggs were phenomenal and the Waffle was crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, and the portions and prices were extremely good. The waiters and waitresses were also awesome and always refilled water and bread without us asking. It was definitely worth the 40 dollars we paid for such good food. I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas and this place does not disappoint!"

Got great seats for me and wifey at Celine concert (which in it's own right is legendary), stopped by busy Mesa Grill asked if they had anything after the concert and a very nice guy said we'll have a spot for you when you come out.    Exit concert enter Mesa Grill.  We've been to MG and it was great the first time... BUT you know about 2nd times right?  Well this put up an awesome repeat performance. They did have a sign saying they were closing early that night?  Was Mr. Flay making an entrance tonight?  Was that why everything was polished perfect?  I really could care less, everything was perfect and that's all that matters (after our lovely Olives evening - this was refreshing). \n\nPatrido Margharita - awesome, strong, no syrups\nTiger Shrimp Tamale -  Perfect, no other words\nCoffee Filet - perfect spice, perfectly cooked.... ummmm Perfect\nChile Crusted Pork Tenderloin -  another P for AWESOME\nCrushed Blueberry Tart - surprisingly light, very tastey great ending \n\nThe fact that the last 2x i've been there have put consistantly great dishes makes me give 5 stars.

S"I have a friend who's nemesis is Bobby Flay.  So I wanted to make sure we ate there.  The Bellagio buffet was packed, so I called last minute to make a brunch reservation for 11.  After about an hours wait in the comfy lounge chairs, we were seated.  Service was a bit slow throughout our meal, but I was just glad we were able to get a table for so many with such short notice.\n\nThe bread basket was delicious, with bite-size jalapeno cheese cornbread, mini cranberry scones, and coffee cake.  For appetizers, I tried the Bacon Queso Quesadilla w/ fried egg, which was okay, and the Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale, which was awesome.  The sauce, the jumbo shrimp, the tamale... everything was delicious and went well together.  I think I would've just been happy having a larger portion as my main entree.  I felt like a burger and since Bobby Flay is a burger fan, I figured I'd give the Mesa Burger a shot.  The burger patty itself was thick and super juicy, but it was a bit bland.  But the horseradish mayo and grilled onions helped.  The southwestern fries were pretty good, but didn't think they were as addicting as the server mentioned.  I think I'm still thinking about the parmesan truffle fries from a certain steakhouse.\n\nIn the end, I was stuffed and enjoyed my meal.  If I were to come back, I think it would definitely be for dinner, since the brunch menu was limited in choices."

S"After hours of poker at Caesar's Palace it was time for some lunch with a friend. Walking around the hotel on Sunday early doesn't give you many choices and we blindly stumbled into Mesa Grill (didn't even check Yelp reviews). \n\nWe were seated fast and taken care of from the second we sat down. Sadly the brunch menu didn't have the dish I was craving (their version of a Cuban) but I found up trying this southwestern steak sandwich item that was top notch. I special ordered a side of grits and they were to die for. I ended up ordering another side of them because I couldn't deal without more of that. Properly made grits west of the Mississippi is pretty amazing in itself. \n\nThe price was a tad steep for what I received which led to the 4 star instead of 5 but it is Vegas and we were at Caesar's so it is to be expected. I just think it notched the place a little back to reality for me."

S'I could care less about the "celebrity" chefs phenomenon. Can\'t help but think it adds 20% to the tab of such restaurants. In the case of Mesa Grill, we didn\'t really notice Mr. Flay\'s influence in that the meals we ordered didn\'t particularly stand out from any other restaurant of this type.\n\nWe were a party of six celebrating a birthday.\n\nOverall the service was very good and responsive. Oddly, they don\'t have salt and pepper shakers at the tables. I asked the server to bring it. She never did. Must have spaced it.\n\nI ordered the $50 bone in-ribeye. Couldn\'t get much flavor out of it. Gee I missed the salt and pepper.\n\nOthers at our table said they enjoyed their meal. No one was "over the top" in their praise.\n\nThe side dishes were ridiculously small and absurdly overpriced.\n\nThe setting was beautiful - lots of glass with casino views.\n\nI suppose Mesa Grill qualifies as a moderate to high priced "upscale" restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip. It\'s about what I expected in a tourist trap town.'

S'A group of us travels to Vegas each year in search of old NAB friends and dining fun.  We have had many superb lunches, but this dinner fell flat.\n\nThe appetizers were fine, which made the main courses that much more disappointing.  Our group ordered:\n\nThe chile-crusted rabbit with a bedding of cous-cous -- the rabbit was cooked perfectly, but the natural flavor of the protein could not be discerned.  I\'ve had a fair bit of rabbit and red squirrel in my day, and enjoy the flavors; our dining companion did not get that chance, the flavor was lost in his dish.\n\nAnother of our group had the Mahi-Mahi and declared it well cooked but under-seasoned.  \n\nThe third member of our table had the evening\'s special, the arctic char.  It was perfectly cooked with the skin crisped expertly and presented skin-up to preserve the texture.  The flavor of the protein was the star of this dish and we declared this the only success of the night.\n\nI had the pork tenderloin.  Eager to ease into the palate of flavors (boubon sauce, a touch of the habenero drizzle) I started with just a piece of the pork.  The rub utterly masked any porky goodness and left a sort-of spicy dirt aftertaste.  By cutting a piece of pork, ensuring a light coating of the bourbon sauce and a dash of the habenero sauce, I could "get" what the creator of the recipe had in mind.  Sadly, you could have rubbed a piece of soggy cardboard and then dipped the sauces to pretty much good effect.  Unfortunately, I wanted a wonderful protein to be the star, enhanced by some clever sauce choices.  The sweet potato tamale needed something to cut the cloying sweetness (yes, I know they\'re called sweet potatoes for a reason).\n\nThis might have been a one-star event, were it not for the skilled wait and bus staff and the wonderful arctic char.  For at least these reasons, we\'ll be taking Mesa Grill off our dining destination rotation in the future.'

This was our first meal of the day and we were starving.  We had a short wait of about 15 minutes but had a drink while we waited.  Our server greeted right away and his assistant brought us water and assortment of bread.  First of all the bread was really good.  There was a combination of mini bite size jalapeno cheese biscuit, blue corn and yellow corn bread (the best corn bread I've ever had) and two fruit type of pastry bars.  \n\nFor the appetizers we had the tiger shrimp tamales and a crispy bacon hash quesadilla topped with a over easy egg.  Both were outstanding.  My wife had the chillaquilles and I had the burger.  Both entrees were delicious and so flavorful.  \n\nService was on par and the atmosphere was great.

S"I'm a huge Bobby Flay fan so couldn't wait to try Mesa Grill when we visited Vegas recently. The reservation system is a bit of a pain, you call a central line for everything at Caesars and then have to say the name of the property that you are trying to make a reservation for. I had to call a couple of times because we had to make a change to our reservation, and every time it sent me to the wrong place on the first 1 or 2 tries. I was finally able to successfully connect to the correct reservations folks though and once I got through everything went smoothly. \n\nWe had a party of 6 and everyone loved their meal. Our friends were ordering wine by the glass and the server recommended a very nice bottle instead which was surprisingly affordable. Everyone loved their meal. \n\nMy DH and I started with the shrimp tamales since there were so many recommendations for them here and they are 1 of the 2-3 items that the waiter said have been on the menu since day 1. I thought they were very good, but wasn't blown away by them. Then we shared the coffee rubbed rib eye and the green chili cauliflower. both were outstanding. The steak was nicely charred on the outside and perfectly medium rare. The rub had a combination of savory and sweet in it and there were 2 sauces. A spicy green sauce and some kind of red sauce. They were both very good but the green on was my favorite. The cauliflower was to die for! I also had tastes of the salmon which was perfectly cooked and had a really lovely sauce and the pork tenderloin which has a very tasty rub. The fish portions seemed to be about average size, but the pork and steak portions were huge. our steak was 22 ounces, which was plenty for the 2 of us. \n\nMesa Grill is definitely worth a second visit."

S"First off, I love the decor and the mix of music.  I tried to get our server to give me their play list.  Apparently, Bobby Flay as some music company in NYC that compiles the mix and puts it into an iPod and ships it to each of his restaurants regularly.  hmm, how do I intercept that shipment .... \n\nAs for the food.  I've been here both for dinner and Sunday brunch.  The food was good, but maybe I'm just not the TexMex kinda gal.  The brunch basket was really yummy, I wanted to take that with me.  The grits were also really good.  Actually, if I had just the bread basket and the grits I would have been just fine.  The goat cheese queso fundido was also fabulous.  Just make sure you don't let it cool down too much before you dive in.  I was really hung over, so the cactus pear ice tea with the liquid sugar was my poison of choice.  The spicy chicken + sweet potato hash was good, but I don't see me craving it.  Same with my dinner selection on a previous visit.  I ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubber Pork Tenderloin, it was good, but not very memorable."

S"Sooooo, my lovely girlfriend and I decided to check this place out.  \n\nIt was pretty much what I had expected from a well known chef. \n\nWe had the concierge make our reservation for us, and arrived a little earlier than we had expected.  This was apparently no problem, as we were seated immediately.  Our waitress was pleasant and explained everything to us fairly promptly after we sat down. \n\nI ordered the pork tenderloin and my sweetheart had the Stuffed pepper.  We were probably expecting to wait a little bit for our food to arrive after ordering, but surprisingly we were served somewhat quickly.  I'd say within about 10 minutes of ordering our food, it was sitting in front of us. \nBoth of our entrees were really well prepared and very tasty. \n\nIf I had to complain about anything, it would be the ice cubes.  I had expected that maybe for once (in vegas) that when I ordered up a bourbon on the rocks, I'd actually, finally see a real ice cube. Especially in a restaurant where people are supposed to know about these things.  It was pretty disappointing to have three slivers of ice, that had basically melted by the time I was served.  Honestly I'm only really complaining about it since on the dessert and drink menu they list a glass of a nice bourbon for $35.  I feel like if you were to order the higher end stuff as an after dinner drink, you would be pretty disappointed if you ordered it on the rocks.  I know that this is a small detail to most, but I think many people that drink scotch or bourbon would agree.  If you're ordering a drink on the rocks, there is a reason for it.  \n\nOverall the experience was great, and I would definitely stop her again sometime, though I think maybe for lunch, and hit up someplace a bit more high end for dinner."

The dinner wait can go up towards an hour, so plan accordingly. The second time we went, we strategically chose to come during lunch time and there was no wait at all. SUCCESS!!!\n\nPROS:\n- Shrimp and corn tamale - best freaking tamale ever. You HAVE to order this.\n- Complimentary bread basket -  southwest corn muffin, jalapeno and cheese bread, and cranberry and walnut bread. Everything was delicious.\n- Ambiance and decor - that wood panel ceiling is incredible.\n- Service: attentive, kept our water and bread basket refilled. \n\nCONS:\n- They make you take your hat off! It felt a little intrusive, but I guess Mesa Grill is a nice enough place, where they can request such things. \n- Depending on what you order, the food can be SO HEAVY, my cousin and I were in a food coma for HOURS, and we only shared an appetizer and entree. \n- Spicy chicken and sweet potato hash - more an appetizer to be shared than an entree on its own. I got tired of it towards the very end of sharing, so I couldn't imagine having it all for myself."

S'We tried to get a table one night -- Wednesday, thinking this would be a slow night -- but couldn\'t get one until 7:30, which is just too late for us.  The hostesses were very nice about it but could not yield to our disappointment no matter how sad and pathetic a face I was wearing.  She gave us a card wtih their phone number and a sugggestion to call in the morning for a reservation.  We didn\'t because we weren\'t sure we\'d be available.  Several days later we stopped in for lunch and were prompltly seated in what we thought was a "good" table.  YAY!\n\nThe waiter was tall, good-looking, impeccably professional, and friendly.  I\'ve heard some people express concern about bringing kids to MESA... and we brought two of them.  He really knew how to take care of us and how to effectively take care of our kids.  (I think he mentioned having 6 of his own, incluing a couple the same ages as ours.)\n\nLunch was fantastic and commensurate with the price.  We had a Bobby Flay Burger, Ancho-crusted scallop salad, Cornmeal crusted chile relleno, and the youngest child had the Crimini mushroom quesedilla.  As an appetizer we shared a Goat cheese queso fundido.  All was great and well within the palate of even our 8 year old.\n\nAll of our plates were picked up by the bus boy empty... practically licked clean.\n\nHaving never had Flay food before, I had a ntoion of what it might be like only from watching Chef Flay on the innumberable TV shows he is on.  His food lived up to that expectation:  fresh, high-quality, punchy flavors, cooked perfectly, and plating that was both clean and pretty.  Like most tourists we photographed our food... no matter how goofy that may have looked.\n\nOne of the best parts of the experience was the way we were allowed to enjoy the experience without a hint of either slowness or rushing.  If we needed anything there was someone immediately available to help.  When we were eating and talking, we were left alone to have our privacy.\n\nAll-in-all, this was definitely one of those "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" experiences.

S'I am writing a review before reading any other reviews of this place.  I had an opportunity to dine there and took it.  I had New York strip as well as shared a blue corn duck appetizer and a bottle of wine.  The steak was easily by far the best steak I have had in my life.  I actually closed my eyes while chewing.  I love steak and am a bit of a cook myself but this was just heaven.  I could have eaten two of them.  The appetizer was very nice as well and interesting.  Even the bread that was served has some chili taste in it and was nice.  I also sampled the pork tenderloin and thought it was very good but I am a steak man and usually I would order something like a ribeye which is pretty much guaranteed to have flavor but Bobby Flay being from New York and all I decided to go with the New York strip.  Boy was it a life changing steak!!!!  It was 48$ for the steak and I think the two of us got out of the joint for around 200$ with one appetizer one dessert and a bottle of nice red wine.  I would absolutely be back to eat the same steak again.  It came with a red and green MESA sauce....I will probably order a bottle as I think they sell it separately.  Wow what a steak!  If you thought Bobby Flay was hype then you were very wrong my friend.'

Mesa Grill is easy to find in it's central location in the middle of the casino and with it's vibrant colors pouring out. \n\nThe staff was very professional and friendly. We were seated almost instantly and took in the surroundings - very eclectic and energetic decor. Opening the menu, there is a lot to choose from. I myself ordered the duck with the chile rilleno on the side, and the man decided to try the halibut with a side of mashed potatoes. And, of course - there were Margaritas. We just ordered the classic version on the rocks...\n\n...I can't rave enough about them. DELICIOUS! I could have had about 5 more. However, being in Vegas, one has to pace themselves. \n\nAfter a scrumptious bread bowl, the food came. Presentation was fantastic, and the taste even better.  My duck was some of the best I've ever had - savory, spicy, juicy. The homemade tamale on the side was delish and the chile rilleno - I died. ORDER THIS EXACT MEAL. \n\nAll in all - ambiance was A+.

They're small but they pack so much flavor in those three bites!!! \n\nFavorite entree: coffee rubbed filet.  It's got a great kick to it and meat was flavorful and juicy!! \n\nDesserts were good, not great. I'd suggest getting and extra appetizer or entree instead."

S'Mehhhh! So we had 5pm dinner reservations for 6ppl. 3 of us arrived a few minutes early and checked in, the host advised us we wouldnt be seated until all of our party arrived and that our table wasnt ready. Thr waiting area was packed and we sat at the bar. There were a ton of empty tables, but whatev. We ordered 2 Partida margaritas and I asked for a frozen one but it was either straight or on the rocks... Ok, when anyone thinks of a margarita they think of a yummy frozen drink. This was the second fail.  \n\nThe rest of our party arrived and we let the waitress know... But we still ended up waiting another 20mins. Finally we get seated and our waitress gives us our menus and 2 mins later asks if we are ready to order, ahhh! No way man!\n\nI look at the menu and first im in price shock, but then I was like "is this all?" The selections werent impressive at all. I usually only eat chicken and here they had only one dish!!! They had a ton of meat and a lot of fish. The entree prices are 25$ and up. We ordered a few apps: the shrimp tamale, the chicken tacos, the chorizo meatballs, and some salads.\n\nOk so heres the rundown!\n\nThe apps: ok so for 12$-18$ for apps I expect not just 1 tamale or 3 small balls... But this is what you get. The chorizo had a smooth texture, which I am not used to, and were sooo small! Basically each of the 6 of us got half a ball. We also had to share 1 measly tamale and 3 chicken skewers and soft tortillas... Ahh! \n\nDinner: I ordered 16 spice chicken. I noticed that the sides were 8$ each... What!? Whatever we ended.up ordering 2 mashed potatos which to me were creamy and bland &Some brussel sprouts. My chicken came and it was a piece of dark and light rubbed in what seemed like adobo spices. I tried it and it def needed salt imo and towards the middle it looked a little pink so I stopped eating it. Sad face for sure. I ended up just eating some jalapeno bread and the dark piece.\n\nMy gringo friends love it here; I am not a fan. Its a small amount of food for the price which was whatever. I didnt like that we had to wait for a reservation and my friend had to ask twice for items he ordered. The waitress was ok, a lil weird : ) we dropped 600$ with tip and they were acting like we were bothering them by asking them for things. Oh well! I did love their paper towels in the bathroom!'

S'Located inside the massive compound that is Caesar\'s Palace; Mesa Grill is brilliantly juxtaposed between the Corinthian columns and marble statues of ancient Greece and the impressive sports book and gaming tables of modern Vegas.  The restaurant\'s facade is cool, it is elegant and refined, yet laid back and calls to mind the island feel of the Caribbean.\n\nWe arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and were invited graciously to sit at the bar.  We promptly obtained drinks from the bartender, and were ushered to our table without issue.  However, our server seemed displeased that we had ordered drinks from the bar thus lessening his sale for our table.  We ordered two of the Tiger shrimp tamales which arrived at an unsettlingly fast pace.  Any hesitation by the "fast-food" speed with which they appeared was soon dashed by the overwhelming deliciousness that sprang forth from the plates.  Having eaten at many superb restaurants I feel compelled to say that these are some of the best starters I have yet to experience.\n\nAfter the table was cleared I sat in anticipation for the main courses to arrive.  Our table had ordered two of the Coffee Rubbed Filets, one of the Black Angus Strips and one Chipotle Glazed Ribeye as well as an order of collard greens, mashed potatoes and, upon recommendation of the server, an order of Brussel sprouts.  My steak arrived and I noted how truly pleasing it was to the eye; however, I was disheartened that such an exquisite piece of meat seemed over powered by the bountiful amount of sauce on the plate.  Once I had cut into my steak and taken a bite I was instantaneously reminded that this was Chef Bobby Flay\'s house and his cooking was inextricably linked to him.  The protein on my plate was classic and refined and delicious, yet it had been arrogantly and flamboyantly altered to meet the needs of a Chef\'s personality.  The two sauces on the plate competed with the beef and reminded me of an episode of "Throwdown" except no one won, and my palate was an innocent bystander.\n\nI looked for solace in the sides on the table and it was then I noticed that the recommended sprouts were missing.  After some time, we got the server\'s attention and asked him to forget the sprouts since we probably wouldn\'t need them or have room for them at this point.  He blatantly disregarded this request and demanded that we try them, because to do so would somehow be a personal affront to him.  We yielded.  When the sprouts arrived they were undercooked and over-seasoned to the point of sheer carelessness.  We each sampled one for the humor of it but left them on the table as a comedic reminder of how far off this meal had gone.\n\nIn summaton, this restaurant has the location, the ambience and the kitchen to be elite.  Yet when given an opportunity to let the cuisine evolve into greatness, it seems the staff from the highest to lowest get in the way of their own success.'

The service was very good, the food okay,as the portion are small for the price(on appetizers). My lamb chop was peppery, and lack a little flavor,, did not care for the brown sauce drizzle around it. I tried my friend's scallops, it was yummier.... The white peach margaritas were great, would of had a few more , but not at $14 ea,, maybe they need to sell it cheaper by a pitcher...I loved, the tiger shrimp tamale,, yummy-o.. Dessert were top notch, tasty.. Yes we had to order a couple of the tiger apps and blue pancake with duck,as all apps are only one on plate, if you are sharing a taste, more than a bite, the price adds up $$$$.."

S'Ok, so we just returned from vacation and I think this is the first time I\'ve written a Yelp review on vacation.  My boyfriend is a HUGE fan of Bobby Flay, and tries to emulate his own cooking after Flay\'s style.  I don\'t cook and I am a very picky eater, but what an amazing and fun experience Mesa Grill was!  I don\'t eat meat but I love seafood so I was happy to see spicy tuna & salmon tartares on the appetizer menu.  Every ingredient enhanced the fish, and the combination of various spices and herbs was a symphony of flavor!  Loved the appetizer!  Being the salad person that I am, I ordered the grilled asparagus salad...grilled asparagus, pecans, wild roasted mushrooms and mixed greens, and I asked for no blue cheese crumbles though that is also part of the dish.  It was gorgeous, both in plating appearance and taste.  Rob excitedly ordered the coffee-rubbed filet mignon and I think we took multiple pictures of his dish before he cut into it.  I didn\'t taste it, but he swears up and down that it was the "best meal I\'ve ever eaten".  The service was spot on and the wine sommelier even came to our table to help us pick out a spectacular cuvee that went with our meal.  We\'re already planning our next trip to Vegas...or maybe NYC or the Bahamas where the other Mesa Grill venues are located.  :)'

After a day of watching sports in an electric environment it is a luxury to be able to sit down for an extraordinary dinner without missing a beat. \n\nThe food is classic Bobby Flay. A mix of NYC and Southwestern flavors balanced to perfection. The interior of the restaurant is modern and chic, but not overly formal. You can come dressed in a suit and tie or casual and feel equally at home.\n\nCongrats Bobby on creating a restaurant that is approachable to the masses yet serves world class cuisine."

S'Mesa Grill, is Bobby Flay\'s restaurant. Like it name-sake, it sucks. I\'m sorry but just because he\'s on the food network doesn\'t mean anything. Maybe, I\'m the only person that feels this way but I only came here to see if maybe that although he\'s such a tool on TV, "He has to be a good chef/ restauranteer, right?" No. The answer is a resounding, "No." There are so many good eats in Vegas... especially at this price range, so I suggest you end up there instead.'

S"This is a very solid restaurant.  It located in Caesar's.  We ordered the Tiger Prawn Tamale and Duck Blue Corn Pancake for apps.\n\nThe Tiger Prawn Tamale was so delicious.  The tamale was silky and creamy.  The flavor was magnificent.  \n\nNext the duck was cooked perfectly.  It was tender and the star anise sauce complimented the duck well.  The habenero sauce added extra heat.\n\nThe New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin was really great.  The pork was cooked to a perfect pink medium and also was juicy.  The ancho chile sauce worked well with the pork.\n\nThe Chile Relleno was really good.  The crusty exterior was cooked perfectly.  But the inside was moist and has tons of flavor.\n\nFinally the Chipotle Glazed Rib-eye was a little underwhelming.  While it was cooked perfectly, the chipotle glaze didn't enhance the meat.  If anything, I think it disguised or masked the nice beef flavor.  I think it would have been better just with salt and pepper.\n\nAnyway, very solid restaurant."

S'One of my "go to" spots when I take my semi annual Vegas trip. Never been here for lunch but my dinners have always been superb. I almost always order the Coffee rubbed fillet and typically some sort of starter (I saw a few people on yelp  complained about the tiger shrimp tamales but I have always found them to be quite good). Also the bread basket is YUMMY! Sour dough, tomato  and Corn bread oh my! Todo we are deeeefinately not in Kansas anymore!  \n\nJust one word to the wise... This is not your typical "Tex Mex" restaurant. Sure i SUPPOSE it does have Mexican flavors and some Texan influence. But, you will not be getting refried beans, chili con queso and 5 dollars nachos.  After all people.. This is a Bobby Flay dining experience and he would NEVER allow such typical dishes that lack innovation. \n\nIn short, yessss i am a fan. My favorite restaurant in the world? No... But still one i go back to over and over again. If you are a foodie, this is 100 percent worth at least a meal or two.'

Both the pork tenderloin and ribeye are top-notch, spicy, sweet, perfectly seared. The buttery sweet potato tamale with pecans is awesome! Better than the side of blue corn basil tamale. Even the bread basket is awesome - chili asiago cheese, walnut raisin, blue cornbread... Yummy. We had some chocolate pudding that was delicious, creamy milk chocolatey. Service is friendly, helpful and responsive. My son loves the cheese quesadillas they will make for kids.

My mom was definitely thrilled.\n\nWe started in the bar where we sat and enjoyed a drink while waiting for our table.  I was impressed with the wine list and enjoyed a Pinot...but mom took a recommendation and ordered a house Margarita.  She was not disappointed.\n\nI ordered the Pan Seared Halibut and it was one of those meals where I ate teeny, tiny bites because I did not want it to be gone!  Mom ordered an over the top New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin - even though I was loving my selection...I was envious of her's as well.\n\nOur waiter started out a little on the cold side, but he quickly warmed up and was very enjoyable.

S'I love watching Bobby Flay on Food Network, so my friends and I had to try Mesa Grill when I went to Vegas. Customer service was awesome, and we were seated in a corner booth. \n\nAppetizer:\nWe were first served with a basket of warm baked goods - savory muffins, sweet biscuits, etc., which was a very nice touch. We shared the rough cut tuna nachos ($16), and it was very light and refreshing. The portion was small though, so not really good for sharing among a group of 3+. \n\nMain entree:\nOrdered the Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich with Southwestern Fries ($16; grilled red onion, Argula ancho chile mayonnaise) - DELICIOUS! The pork was thick, juicy, flavorful and tender. The mayonnaise really brought together the entire sandwich, and the fries were so good that my friends ordered another side dish of it. Definitely recommend this sandwich. \n\nOne of us also ordered the Spicy Chicken + Sweet Potato Hash ($18), which he liked very very much.'

S"Upon entering the restaurant, one of the men in our group of eight was asked to remove his fedora hat. They said that it was a hotel policy that hats are not allowed in the dining room of the restuarants, yet we also dined in Rao's and 9 and people wore hats in both dining rooms. \nWe sat near the kitchen, and a man in a sweatshirt and knit ski cap leaned against the kitchen window throughout our entire meal. When we asked why he could wear a hat, the manager said that hats were allowed in the lounge. If they are going to implement a dress code they should start with shorts and sweatshirts, and make their guests aware of the policy.\nAs far as the food, they were out of three dishes and had no specials. I ended up ordering Sophies chopped salad which should be on the kids menu, it was mostly cheese cubes, tortilla chips and garbanzo beans. For dinner I ordered a coffee rubbed filet, which was so spicy, I went through a tube of tums while out after dinner. The shrimp in the tamale appetizer was good.\nThe margaritas were too sweet. The margaritas at Dos Caminos in Palazzo are much better."

S"Lunch here was unexpectedly good!\n\nI had never ate at a Bobby Flay establishment before and was not really in a hurry to try.  Truth be told I've never really been a fan of his but, after reading several reviews of some trusty yelp friends I decided to give this place a try.  The resto is located in Caesar's palace.  The decor is warm but clean and open.  We came here during lunch with no reservation.  Waited about 15min and was seated near the kitchen.  Im realizing more and more that there are tables for 2 which I get but seriously can the tables be a little bigger!!!  I'm just saying!!\n\nSo after looking over the menu I remembered that everyone was raving about the tamales so we ordered that, and another appetizer to share and our main.\n\nTiger shrimp roasted corn tamale ~ First let me say the masa was very light unlike other tamales I've had.  The shrimp was plump and cooked perfectly.  The cilantro sauce was creamy but also very light and really brought the entire dish together.\n\nBlue corn pancake ~ Barbecued Duck with Habanero Chile and Star Anise Sauce.  Holy moly I would have to say this was the star of the dining experience.  I never would have thought to sauce up duck with BBQ.  This was a fantastic dish.  \n\nSmoked Shrimp Tacos ~ Skewered shrimp with Cabbage Slaw and Grilled Tortillas.  It came with 3 salsas to use.  The shrimp had a decent smoke flavor to it.  There was not heat to it although it looked like there could be.  To me it was just your typical shrimp taco.  Nothing too exciting.  The mango salsa with a bit of kick was really tasty.\n\nGrouper ~ I only had a bit of it.  The portion was really bit and had great flavor.  It didn't appear to be dry which I don't care for when eating fish.\n\nWe passed on dessert since lunch already started off late plus we had other plans.  All in all I would have to say it was a pleasant experience.  I would not mind coming back here to eat.  \n\nEyes ~ Warm and inviting decor.\nNose ~ Even though we say near the kitchen there was not a smell that was present!\nEar ~ Not very loud.  Just your usual!\nMouth ~ Duck in BBQ sauce!\nTummy ~ Very well satisfied!"

The sweet potato tamale was heavenly, although next time I'll get more pecan butter.  My mom got the rib eye without all the sauces and it was one of the tastiest pieces of beef I've ever had.  It was much better than the flavorless filet my dad had, but then if you're looking for a tasty piece of cow, you don't order filet.  I also loved the blue corn muffin and the prickly pear iced tea.  \n\nThe rest of my family had tickets to see Bette Middler, conveniently located just feet from Mesa Grill, so we didn't have time for appetizers or desserts.  It hurts me to think about what I missed, but I take comfort in the fact that while they were watching Ms. Middler sing her heart out, I was in my hotel room eating their leftovers.\n\nupdate- I just got the Mesa Grill cookbook from Costco.  It's that good.  I'll be heading back to Vegas just to eat there and see O."

After that, a bread basket came out pretty quickly- all the breads were delicious!  Because we were starving, we cleaned out the breads before our food came out. \n\nFor appetizers, we ordered the shrimp with roasted garlic corn tamale, as well as the blue corn pancake with barbecued duck. Both were delicious!  \n\nFor entrees, I had fish, and my bf had the pork tenderloin. We also ordered sides of corn (omg!!) and baked potato. We were both very happy with our entrees, but between the two, I think I enjoyed my bf's pork tenderloin a tad more.

Also, your entire group needs to be there before they seat you.  The hostesses aren't the best, but whatever.  It's rare that I find a hostess station that I would say has great service.  \n\nThe steaks are enormous, so I like to find someone willing to share.  The Jalapeno Cheese Bread is so good you have to hold back to save room for the actual meal.  This time I had the Wild Mushroom Grits.  It was spicier than I anticipated, but I love spicy foods so it was a pleasant surprise!  And the pork tenderloin was wonderful, and cooked to perfection. Oh and the Red Apple Martini, so yummy!  \n\nOur server Michael was fabulous as always!  He is definitely part of the reason we keep going back!

This dish is excellent and lighter fare than I generally go for. This meant more room for dessert and having perfectly paced this evening, tonight was the night for Churros! Not just any churro, but Bobby's special churros dusted with cinnamon sugar and star anise, \ndark chocolate and  coconut dulce de leche dipping sauces. \n\nWow!

I had a big ribeye which was excellent. The dessert of banana pudding was super good. Great service, extreme care in the food quality and presentation. \nBe warned, when making reservations, they take your credit card # and will charge you $50 per person if you cancel outside their terms.'

S'Fun restaurant, great service. My family loves Bobby Flay so we couldn\'t wait to come here while in Vegas. Our waiter was really outstanding and knowledgeable. That is one of the perks of eating at a restaurant owned by one of the more well-known chefs in the country... they always have knowledgeable, informed, and helpful staff. \n\nTo start, they give you homemade corn muffins made with yellow and blue cornmeal. These were very tasty! I can\'t remember the rest of the bread basket contents, but the corn muffins really stood out. \n\nFor an appetizer, I ordered the gala apple salad. If I came for lunch I would probably order this as my meal... delicious. Great combination of flavors, and I especially loved the combination of toasted pecans with spicy orange vinaigrette!\n\nSadly for me, the restaurant only has 1 vegetarian entree option. But that is probably more than most places. It was the cornmeal crusted chile relleno. Normally more cheese than I would order for a meal, but it was a good choice. The chili is stuffed with manchego cheese and red peppers which was a real delight. Very flavorful, definitely not your average dish from a Mexican restaurant! It was very rich, and I was already pretty full from my salad so I took most of it back to the hotel. Yummy, and not a bad option for vegetarians, but sometimes I wish restaurants had less cheesy options as well. \n\nFor dessert, our table of 4 split the banana cream pie and sticky toffee pudding. Although I had no complaints about the banana cream pie, the sticky toffee pudding was really my favorite. It was to die for!! \n\nWith dessert, our waiter recommended something called "tequila crema" that is apparently one of Bobby Flay\'s specials. YUM! Ask for this if you get a chance. It is a sweet, creamy, spicy dessert drink that we all loved. Overall, a great experience here!'

I was hesitant (because I'm kind of cheap) to spend $38 on a dish with no sides, starters or booze, but it was worth it. I'm taking my wife here when we go to Vegas later this summer.\n\nThe other guys raved about their food (and we eat at a lot of nice places) and said it was some of the best food they've had. There was tuna, pork, and steak...all of it was great."

My wife and I were lucky enough to get to go this year and I practically packed a fork and knife in anticipation. \n\nMesa Grill was the first restaurant we tried on the trip. I ordered the Tiger Shrimp Tamale for an appetizer and it absolutely hit the spot. The flavor was extremely bold, and I literally used my spoon to scrape the remaining sauce from the plate. Delicious.\n\nFor the main course I decided to try the pork tenderloin sandwich and I absolutely loved the combination on the plate. I love to combine my food, and I recommend putting the fries in the sandwich as you eat. By the way, the pork is served cold and medium rare, which the waiter warns you about in advance. For this reason, I don't understand fellow yelpers complaining that the sandwich was not hot, or undercooked.\n\nMy only small complaint would be I didn't like the corn bread served before the meal.\n\nAfter it was all said it done, we ended up going to the Mesa Grill two out of the three days. This is no small fact considering we could eat wherever we wanted. I now find myself having dreams about that pork tenderloin sandwich. Loved that sauce.\n\nRecommended."

When our food arrived, the plate had a big hair on it, I immediately brought it to the attention of the server and the manager who got my food to the table, they took it back and immediately got one back, just by removing the hair, when I asked them why did they get the same plate, they lied and said they made a different one, it was impossible, first of all I had to wait for a good 20 mins before they got my entree out so there was no way they would do another one in seconds, secondly I was sitting very close to the kitchen and saw it with my own eyes that it was the same plate. I decided not to contradict as I had my 3 yr old around, we barely ate, paid the check and walked out, they did not compensate the dish, neither did they apologize. So not done....not going back.'

Perfectly cooked eggs! So delicious and great presentation. I think next time I might want to share and entree or skip the appetizers cuz the bread basket they bring is outta this world! The bread basket is filled with like 5 different kinds of breads and muffins. Corn muffins, cranberry muffins, normal bread, jalapeno cheese poppers! Carb heaven!\n\nThe decor is very glamorous and trendy. Service is attentive. There was a 10 minute wait on a Sunday around 11am. Not bad at all. You can always go to the bar to wait =P'

YUM.  probably the best part of the meal.  jalapeno biscuits, crumb cake, and some other pastries that got me excited about the entree\'s to come.\n\nfirst we had our "grapefruit mimosas" we ordered off the menu.  they were quite tasty but at $12.50 a pop, i should have gotten a bloody mary or something.\n\ni had the burger.  i got it medium well bc our server said their "medium" was more on the medium rare side.  well, as i bit into the burger, parts of the patty were well done while some parts were sorta pink, i guess.  eh, it was still pretty tasty.  the pickled vidalia onion was a nice touch.  i\'m a huge fan of mustard but i think i would have liked a more sweeter, tangy-er sauce to balance out the pungent, sharp cheddar on top.\n\nthe fries were OK, a little too cooked for my taste.  they had a nice cajun spice sprinkled over them that wasn\'t overpowering.\n\nmy fiancee had the salmon.  the description sounded better than it tasted.  i was expecting an explosion of sweet, spice, savory, etc., etc., especially from Mr. Flay.  but the fish, albeit fresh and cooked properly, wasn\'t very flavorful.  oh well.\n\nw/ tax and tip the lunch came out to a little over $80.  not sure if we\'ll be back.'

Gordon Ramsey steak was sold out :(.\n\nThat being said the food here was really good! starting with the bread basket, the asiago cheese jalapeno bread was soo yummy. I had the grilled chicken and it was excellent. I also really like the tamale that came as my side dish. I also ordered the twice baked potato as an extra side and the spicy horseradish that came with it was so good. \n\nFor dessert i had the chocolate pretzel tart with peanut butter icecream. sooo good!! even if i only got a small piece of pretzel (The boyfriend stole the rest!) \n\nBest part was the quick seating (we had a reservation) and the SUPERB service from the staff.

Oh my god. My husband had the tacos and he had food envy for sure. Tacos were definitely delicious but TINY!! 3 of them could be eaten in 6 bites or less. The soup was absolutely incredible with the maple cream and marcona almonds...highly recommend.\nWe shared the romaine salad, very good and not overdressed. Yummy cheese crisp in the middle. \nI had the filet mignon for dinner, perfectly medium rare and very very yummy. Spicy chipotle coating, which was not overpowering.\nHusband had the pork tenderloin - then it was my turn for food envy - wow. Extremely delicious, the sauce was to die for.\nCoconut cake for dessert, skip it. It was totally dry and tasteless. I was very sad because I love coconut cake. Eh.\nWould definitely go back!\nAs an FYI, most of the recipes that the restaurant uses are in Bobby Flay's cookbook...I'll be picking that up soon so I can make that soup. Mmmmm.

'Oh, there's something you should know' was the comment after each of us told him what we wanted to order, which helped make sure there were no surprises when we got our food :). The complimentary bread basket they serve is one of the best yet, with a great variety of breads both sweet and savory, and softened butter to go with! My greatest pet peeve at restaurants is when they give you rock hard butter for your bread, how are you supposed to use that thing?! \n\nI ordered the bbq lamb cobb salad, which was just decent. The lamb was done very well and was very tender, and the bacon slices were tasty, but nothing about it was spectacular about it. They didn't seem to have the dishes that my friend had tried before during their brunch menu, so perhaps I need to come for dinner some time instead. For a first impression though, it was just ok."

S'We ended up sitting at the bar at Mesa Grill, which I like because sometimes you can meet interesting people at the bar. The gentleman to my left suggested the Veal (Fire Roasted Veal Chop w/Horseradish - Maple Glaze & Wild Rice Tamale + Sage Butter). Being that he was a meat distributer, we took him on his word. We also ordered the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin w/ Bourbon - Ancho Chile Sauce & Sweet Potato Tamale + Crushed Pecan Butter and for an appetizer, the Blue Corn Pancake w/ Barbecued Duck + Habanero Chile-Star Anise Sauce. The Blue Corn Pancake w/ BBQd Duck came out first. It was yummy and quite different from what I\'m used to. I\'d definitely would recommend it for anyone that wants to try BBQ Duck that\'s not typical Peking Duck.\n\nOur entrees came out next. The veal chop was probably a bit hyped up. The best way to describe it was that we were underwhelmed by the veal. I\'ve had really tender roast veal at Pines of Rome (Pines of Rome on Yelp) where I didn\'t need to cut it with a knife; it just fell of the bone. The veal at Mesa Grill was a bit tough to cut up and eat and we could barely taste the maple in the horseradish-maple glaze. The wild rice tamale w/ sage butter was definitely tastier than the veal. Kind of disappointing being that the veal dish was $42 and we only enjoyed the tamale! The pork tenderloin was much better but not quite living up to the reviews we\'ve read on Yelp (reviews). The spices seemed to overwhelm the pork and I struggled with rubbing off some of the ancho chile sauce which was liberally "drizzled" all over the pork tenderloin (it was also all over the blue corn pancake w/ duck). The saving grace of the meal was the delicious sweet potato tamale w/ pecan butter. That definitely helped balance the heavily spiced pork and it was all around yummy goodness! All in all, I definitely would give Mesa Grill another shot but wouldn\'t feel compelled to order the veal or the pork tenderloin again.... But definitely the sweet potato tamale!'

The previous two times, somebody else ordred it and I'm the kind of person who wants to see variety on the table.  I was in Vegas by myself, so this was a perfect time to try the Tenderloin.  WOW!!  As good as everyone else has described.  The habanero tint to the sauce on top really gives it a nice heat.  Not too hot.  Just a warm feeling.  I asked for it Medium Rare nowing all chefs working with pork will tend to overcook it.  So, I got it between medium and medium rare.  Just the way I was expecting it."

I traded one of my scallops for one and it was an excellent trade. \nBecause my Aunt and I were both eating Gluten free they brought out some blue corn chips for us while the others noshed on bread.

I was tempted to cancel my entree and get another one of those! 16 spice chicken was loaded with flavor.

I can get better at my local taco stand. We had the churros for dessert and the delicate anise flavor was just right. It should be noted that I typically will avoid this flavor but in the churros, it worked.

Both were really good. I usually don't like tamales (no offense, maybe I've only had bad ones) because they are always so dry, but this one was moist and full of flavor. The corn was the perfect accompaniment too. As for the margarita, you can custom-create your own from their list of tequilas or choose a concocted mix. I had the white peach margarita which was fantastic.\n\nWe had the chicken with sweet potato hash and the steak and egg. The first is very unique and very Bobby. It's a little spicy, and it is basically two huge mounds of chicken and hash mixed together. Very creative. The steak and egg was more traditional; you pretty much just make your own fajitas from guacamole, sour cream, egg, peppers, etc. Also good (although not spectacular) because of the fresh ingredients. \n\nService was slow, although our server apologized because it was really busy.

If you enjoy strong cheeses like me, however, you'll definitely enjoy this dish. \n\nCoffee crusted steak sandwich - the name screams flavor. Unfortunately, the only flavor I could taste was the onion. I was greatly disappointed with the coffee crusted steak because there was absolutely no coffee flavor. The sandwich was unimpressive and something I could make at home. \n\nPork tenderloin sandwich - now THIS is the sandwich to get. It is much tastier than the steak sandwich. The flavor were much better. I also heard from the table next to me that the Cuban burger was the best burger they have ever had. \n\nThe chicken hash (not sure of the exact name but it had egg hollandaise on it) - the best dish on the table. The flavours melded together beautifully and I would get this dish if I return. \n\nThe fries that came with the sandwiches were good. Very salty though. \n\nThe bread and the corn muffin was super delicious. I would definitely come back for lunch because the prices were okay and not too obnoxious.

Since our dinners were taking a bit of time, we also had an amuse bouche courtesy of the chef. It was a similar tuna appetizer. \n\nFor main course, I ordered the 22oz bone in Chipotle Glazed Rib-eye. It was cooked to perfection. The only thing I didn't like was that they don't really let you have it your way. I like my steak a little more rare, but they suggest that you have it medium, as that is the chef recommendation. Nevertheless, the medium was good. \n\nI polished the whole thing down and then... for sides there was the roasted corn with grilled cactus, lime and cotija. This by far is THE BEST THING on the menu. While we got other sides... we only really finished this one and were licking the bottom of the bowl it came in.\n\nFor dessert we had some delicious churros and a cake that I can't remember now.

Yeah, you\'ll probably be looking at roughly $30 for two people not including drinks, extras or tip but I think the atmosphere and food make up for the price.  They bring you a nice array of baked goods as the "bread" while you wait.  All of the egg entrees are served with grits or home fries.  I ordered the scrambled egg enchiladas (eggs, chorizo, goat cheese) and they were delicious, paired with an interesting mix of sauce to provide enough spiciness to give the dish some authenticity.  My dining partner had the ranch eggs tostada which was surprisingly large and equally as tasty.  The grits were a little heavy but so tasty that I couldn\'t avoid eating them.\n\nProbably the only knock is that the drinks are kind of expensive (11.2oz bottle of Chimay Blue = $12) and our waitress seemed a little condescending when we told her we didn\'t want appetizers.  Otherwise the service was actually quite good with the waiters being right on top of refilling waters and coffee.\n\nGiven the prices you pay in Vegas, I think you could do a lot worse on price and food quality, making Mesa a pretty solid choice for any meal.'

So yummy.\nThe goat cheese queso fundido is an appetizer on both the brunch and dinner menus.  It is cheese heaven and the portion is so ginormous that four people can easily share it.  \nAs far as brunch entrees go, both the chilaquiles and the tostada are fabulous.  I love eggs and I love spicy and I doubly love spicy eggs.  Next time I am going to try the enchiladas.\nThe brunch entrees come with either grits or potatoes.

By that time, my dining companions and I have to share one because we are so full, but their desserts are a perfect end to a perfect brunch."

S'Oh Bobby, I know you probably don\'t make it out here a lot, and I know it\'s likely just an extension you of shilling stuff with your name on it, but damn this is a stellar place. As much as it pains me to admit it, this place is on point.\n\nDecor is cool, drinks were awesome, prices were actually pretty reasonable considering the location. \n\nAnd that lamb.\n\nMan, the lamb porterhouse I had was completely out of this world. I don\'t know if the kitchen was just really "on" that night, but I\'ve taken drugs that were less euphoric than the experience of consuming this lamb. \n\nOut waiter was clever, knew the menu, the food, the philosophy, had a "I\'ve been doing this for a while but still totally love it" vibe about him and generally added that last star to put us over the hump. \n\nThere\'s a lot of big name restaurants vying for your company credit card in Vegas. There\'s either another (former) Iron Chef (don\'t get me started on the former part) with a big money place also begging for that coin. I would consider it a mistake to not stop at Mesa during a trip out here. Not a tragedy, but something that you will regret.'

S"Mesa Grill is a Bobby Flay restaurant so there are lots of chiles in everything. Not that this necessarily makes everything spicy, but you should know in case you have a pepper or spice aversion. I arrived late one evening to Vegas and after checking in to my room at Caesar's Palace I decided 1, I needed dinner and 2, I didn't want to go far so Mesa Grill answered my needs.\n\nI've said it before but I'll say it again so no one thinks I ate all this food by myself - I'm a sharer so when I go anywhere I like to order lots of stuff and share it with my dining partners. With this in mind we started with a Caesar type salad that came with chorizo as the meat and it was definitely an interesting take on this basic starter. One that I definitely enjoyed. We then ordered the black bean soup, grits with poached egg, and the pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamale as our main course to sample.\n\nThe black bean soup had just the right amount of spice to it and so I slurped most of it up. The pork tenderloin was indeed tender and the sweet potato tamale that accompanied it was amazingly good. But, the real highlight of the meal was the grits topped with a poached egg. Coming from the South I've had my fair share of grits, sometimes they are made sweet with butter and sugar, sometimes they are made savory with spices and bacon, but I'm going to start suggesting they always come this way from now on. It was an item of food that would be just as comfortable at breakfast as it was at dinner and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.\n\nOur service was also marvelous, the man who served us told us he'd been with the restaurant since they opened and his expertise in suggesting certainly made it seem so."

S'If you do not like what is on the menu, you are in for a bad time.\nOne of my party asked for the grilled Veal Chop without the spices, was told, "that is the way we serve it, no changes", which led me to think, this stuff was prepped way ahead of time.\nFor dessert someone asked for a bowl of choclate ice cream, once again, it will only be served with a ganache of nuts and chocolate(allergy issues be damned).\nI had a seared tuna that was excellent. If you aren\'t willing to bend your culinary tastes, this is probably not the place for you.'

S'I was already scoping out places to eat at while at the San Diego Airport prior to our flight & remembered Mesa Grill.  I couldn\'t wait to get into Vegas & go have lunch here.  Ok, I thought, let\'s see what you got Bobby Flay....\n\nFirst of all, to my disappointment, only the brunch menu was available (at 1pm? really?).  Ok, it\'s Vegas I guess.  \n\nFirst they bring you a bread basket w/ a nice assortment...poppyseed blueberry muffin, cornbread w/ jalapeno, a crumbcake, etc.  Great while you are waiting for your appetizers/entrees.\n\nI ordered the ANCHO CHILE-HONEY GLAZED SALMON with Spicy Black Bean Sauce and Roasted Jalapeno Crema...this was really good.  The flavors came together really well.  \n\nThe BF had the cuban sandwich w/ adobo fries.  The fries were really good.  The sandwich was ok.\n\nI was basically disappointed b/c I expected better.  I would have preferred to come here for lunch or dinner...much more choices.  Also pricey.  We were also warned that all of the dishes were "spicy" b/c that is Bobby Flay\'s style, BUT it wasn\'t spicy at all.  Some spice would have been nice  :-)  I would give this place another try....for dinner.'

S"I have heard many good reviews about Mesa Grill. I made a reservation a month ahead. The interesting part is that Mesa Grill required the customers to provide their credit card numbers. If the customers didn't show up on their reservations, they would charge the credit cards $50. That is interesting, but I don't mind it. I think if people really want to go, they would be willing to go through the trouble.\n\nI love the ceiling with the flaming painting. Nothing would match better with Bobby Flay's cooking style, chili peppers and spices. Before going to Mesa Grill, I was very worried that I couldn't get anything to eat, because I don't eat spicy food at all. When we got there, I talked to the server. He said that most of Bobby's food is not that spicy, and the chili add flavors. He gave a couple of suggestions, and I went with the WILD STRIPED BASS. My husband got the New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin. And, we shared BLUE CORN PANCAKE for appetizer.\n\nThe BLUE CORN PANCAKE is served with shredded pieces of duck. The first bite definitely reminded me of the Chinese Peking duck. The duck was good and juicy. Even though there was Habanero (one of the most intense chili pepper in the world), it wasn't spicy at all. It was very flavorful. My husband loved it! His pork tenderloin was placed nicely on the plate. The rubbed was definitely spicy. Bryan said it was a bit spicy for him, but it was edible. The side SWEET POTATO TAMALE was sweet and delicious. It was a perfect balance with the spicy pork. My WILD STRIPED BASS was crispy on the outside, and cooked perfect on the inside. My favorite was the Piquillo Pepper Clam Chowder under the bass. It was packed with different layers of flavors, and it was not spicy! Fantastic!\n\nThe meal was great. For the two of us, our check was about $120. The food was very good. Bobby has lived up to his reputation. I definitely respect him more. I would love to go back again. This time, I will save some rooms for dessert!"

We were very interested in the twist it had in breakfast/brunch foods so we were sat down and given a chance to look through the menu and they had some different items.  I even took a chance to look at Yelp to see what some of these inventions were.  We ended up ordering the spicy scrambled eggs and the sweet potato hash.  Both were really good and we enjoyed our meals. Would recommend."

S"I rate restaurants on four things: the food I eat, the way I am treated, how comfortable the environment is while I'm eating, and how much all of this costs.  This means I don't eat at a restaurant because a celebrity is associated with it, and therefore any feelings I may have - positive or otherwise - in regard to said celebrity, don't mess with my meal. Good food is a serious business.  It should never be adulterated with bile. \n\nTHE FOOD\nAfter consulting with the waiter, I ordered a cocktail... a Cactus Pear Margarita, a Blue Corn Pancake appetizer, and the Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash.  \n\nThe Cactus Pear Margarita (Herradura Silver Tequila, cactus pear syrup and lime juice) had a strong background flavor of grapefruit, which was not to my taste.  The replacement drink was a White Peach Margarita (white peach puree, Herradura Silver Tequila, lime juice).  It was exquisite.  A perfect balance of flavors.  Not too sweet.  Not too sour.  Not excessively fruity.  \n\nMeanwhile I had the bread basket to explore. It included three breads; a jalapeno cornbread muffin, a slice of nutty whole wheat, and a few wedges of light as air foccacia.  Okay... the muffin was actually the highlight of my entire day.  Maybe several days.  Crumbly, salty sweet, just spicy enough to be interesting.  I immediately wanted a dozen more, and my appetizer hadn't even arrived.  Later I sampled the whole wheat - which was somewhat pedestrian after the muffin, and the foccacia - another delicious surprise.  I could have dined on bread alone and gone away full and happy.  But more was to come.  \n\nThe Blue Corn Pancake is just that, a blue corn pancake filled with barbecued duck, topped with at least three sauces, including the habanero chile and star anise listed on the menu.  The blend of flavors was powerful, exotic, and extremely rich.  People who cannot or don't care for spicy foods should avoid this dish.  The heat of the smoky sweet barbecued duck was balanced with the mild blue corn, then kicked again into high gear with the sauces.  Wow!\n\nThe Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash was... well, interesting.  Topped with a poached egg the combination was relatively mild.  The consistency of the whole dish was soft, almost deceptively so, because the sauces drizzled over the dish were quite spicy. I ate half and brought the rest of it home to Los Angeles to eat later.  It was actually better tasting when I heated it up the next day.  \n\nSince I was taking leftovers home, I went ahead and ordered a dessert.  The waiter and I spent some time talking about what would travel well, eventually settling on the Smoked Vanilla & Toasted Walnut Flan.  Actually, it was a coffee flavored flan with a smoky vanilla caramel top and some candied walnuts on the side. I may sound more blase than I feel, but the description on the dessert menu just did not do it justice.  Even after being hauled onto a plane and stuck in a refrigerator for a day, the flan was creamy, subtly flavored, and absolutely splendid. \n\nIn fact, the whole meal was a five star experience.  It takes a truly superb kitchen to create the effortless complexity of flavor and presentation I got at Mesa.\n\nTHE SERVICE\nI had my luggage with me when I came into the restaurant and the Greeter immediately offered to put it aside in a private locked closet. Although she didn't give me a claim ticket, she did recognize me when I left.  I did wonder how that all works when the restaurant is particularly busy.\n\nAs you can tell already, I take up a waiter's time.  I expect them to be knowledgeable about the menu, familiar with the dishes, and to have an opinion (their favorites).  I did not order the waiter's favorites, but any really good waiter appreciates fine food and WILL have at least one dish on the menu that they rave about.  Great restaurants hire great waiters.  Mesa Grill gets five stars here as well.  Not only did I have a great waiter, I had two, plus a busboy who might as well have been a third, and a personable bartender who brought me my second drink ... AND STOOD THERE waiting to make sure I was happy with it. \n\nMind you, I was there at 1:30 in the afternoon on a Monday.  So most people should not expect to get quite this level of attention, but I have no doubt that these guys are steller even at the most hectic of times. I really put them to the test at the end. I asked to have the hash and a couple of those amazing muffins packed along with the flan.  Then I had them repack it so that I could fit it into my carry on bag.  No fuss.  No looks.  Just whatever help I seemed to need.  (many thanks Joel, Dario & Adam!) \n\nI would write a longer review, but I have run out of room.  Let me just say that the environment was excellent (quiet, light enough to see, but not too bright, and the bathroom was clean), and the bill, including tip was under $75.  For this level of restaurant, that's dirt cheap."

S"Not the best value, but can't deny the excellent flavors here.\n\nI had the pork tenderloin dish here, and it was juicy and well-spiced as promised. I ordered two side dishes, mashed potatoes and Brussels sprouts. The potatoes were runny but had an excellent cheese flavoring. The sprouts were amazing-roasted on the outside which created a caramelized surface with the pomegranates and a smoky flavor. \n\nThe server was friendly but not available as much as you'd like. I suppose it was busy, but could have been anticipated on a Ricky Martin Saturday night. Incidentally, the bread service did not come out for a while, although the jalape\xc3\xb1o slice made it worth the wait.\n\nI was not impressed by dessert. I had the coconut cake, and at least when I was a kid, light and fluffy was the way to go. This cake was soggy and cold-I don't get it.\n\nI paid a fortune for the privilege, but the crowd suggests this won't change soon."

S'Even though Bobby Flay is one the more arrogant chefs on Food Network (what chef isn\'t though?) I still love his food, I\'ve been to his burger joints in NY and wanted to give this restaurant a try. \n\nWe had to order the margaritas since we were told they were phenomenal. My husband had the house margarita and I had the peach margarita and they were really good. For an appetizer, we got the goat cheese queso fundido with blue chips, DELICIOUS!!! I ordered the New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon-ancho chile sauce. Sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter and my husband had "the most expensive steak on the menu" aka black angus new york strip steak and both were phenomenal! \n\nOur sides were mashed potatoes, roasted corn with creme fraiche and green onions (waiter\'s recommendation)\n\nWhen making reservations, we wanted to see if it was ok to bring our daughter who was 9 months, they were very catering to it. Make reservations early, sometimes you won\'t get a reservation until 10pm! \n\nThe meal came to about $190 for 2 people, but completely worth it. Mr. Flay, you are a genius, that is all.'

We saw one of the food prep employees take a french fry off the plate that was set out for a customer and EAT IT! Then, even worse, we saw another food prep person, who was wearing gloves, pick something out of her coworkers hair as he bent down then continue on her job.

We arrived a few minutes early, but we were promptly seated.  \n\nWe were greeted by our waitress who was more than willing to offer suggestions that were quite reliable based upon the smiles on our faces by the end of the meal.  When we asked about wine, she made some recommendations, but also she had their wine guy, Bernardo come over and greet us.  He was fantastic.  He spoke well and made great recommendations for a group of six with very distinct tastes.\n\nOur meals were served in a timely fashion.

S"For a Latin restaurant owned by an Irish dude, this is legit. I went there for brunch on Sunday and highly recommend making reservations because the place can get pretty full. \n\nService was prompt, we had drinks and menus and a run down of the best things to order within 2 minutes of being seated. You start out with various baked savory/sweet pastries while waiting for the food. The chilaquiles were really good and i was glad that they didn't skimp on portion size. My friend got the ranch style tostada which was ok but the sauce was surprisingly sweet, almost too sweet. The drinks (mango&carrot juice and the blood mary) were a nice compliment to the meals, I'd probably order both of them again. \n\nThis is a great place that's more on the casual-upscale side compared to other restaurants on the Strip and the food is worth going back for, especially because the service was so quick (we finished a full meal in 1 hour)! One quick tip: their napkins are super linty, don't put them on your clothes!"

S"Okay, so I understand that Bobby Flay is the owner and creator of this restaurant, and that's not the reason for my 5 star rating.\n\nMesa has the most amazing service I've ever experienced at any restaurant, EVER! The servers work together as a team. It's not just one single server to your table, we had different staff refilling drinks, changing out utensils and asking if there was anything we had needed.\n\nWith that said, the food was amazing! I had ordered the chef special, which was 30$ or a three course meal! What a steal! And 5$ was donated to helping the hungry in Las Vegas... What a great cause. \n\nMy meal included: for my starter, the raw tuna 'nachos' (amazing) the main course, a blue corn tortilla crusted halibut (so flakey and buttery) and for dessert a hands down best cake I've ever had, coconut cream 4 layer cake!\n\nEpic meal!

S'I was referred to Mesa Grill by the Concierge and surprisingly enough, had never heard of Bobby Flay before this, even though I watch the Food Network (how is that possible??).  \n\nMeat was highly recommended by our waiter so I ordered the N.Y. Strip Steak with Mesa Grill House sauce for $48.  Definitely one of the most tender steaks I\'ve eaten in my short life.  The steak was marinated and aged and once I took the first mouth-watering bite, I was glad I ordered the it.  Although it was ala carte, the steak was a good portion, around 20 oz. or so.  I would recommend this piece of meat to any steak lovers out there, but at $50 a pop, I would probably try other things first before repeating.\n\nSides were $8 a piece.  The spinach was okay, I could\'ve passed on that but I needed some greens.  The garlic mashed potatoes however, were excellent.  I\'ve had better before, but they definitely complimented my steak.\n\nTried the Tiger Prawns as my appy and although it was good, it was nothing to write home about.  \n\nOther favorites at the table were the Coffee Filet Mignon and the Tuna Steak.  \n\nTo sum up, the food and service were excellent.  Just figure to pay a little extra for the "Bobby Flay" name.'

Along with the venison was a grits tamale it also was tasteless, dry and overcooked. The side dish was delivered 20 minutes after the main dish was served. I was totally disapointed.

It is pretty amazing how he can put just the perfect amount of spice. Its not overwhelming, but has a little bit of a kick to it. Ive had all different kinds of dishes here and all have been good. Plus extra points for the sticky toffee pudding desert.\n\nPlus Mesa Grill is not crazy expensive either. Well, everything in Vegas is expensive. So this is not wallet breaking expensive.

S"Bobby Flay has a reputation for being a grilling master.  I mean, even his famous restaurant in Las Vegas is called Mesa GRILL.\n\nHowever, my Mesa Burger just didn't have that awesome grilling taste that one would expect.  A properly grilled burger should have been more charred from the high heat of the flame.\n\nMy burger tasted like any typical burger from an ordinary restaurant.  Nothing really stood out.\n\nAlso, the service here was not good.  We had to repeatedly ask for the same request over and over again.  It really wasn't that busy, so I don't understand why the waiter couldn't get the request right from the first time.\n\nThe bread basket was good here though.  It had that heat that one expect from a Southwestern cuisine.\n\nETA - We went there during the weekend lunch (brunch), so they didn't have the classic entree like the Rib Eye.  Maybe the dinner menu would have tasted better, but since we couldn't make it for dinner we had to settle for what was on the lunch menu.  Nevertheless, they have the proper equipment and the knowledgeable technique so the burger should have tasted better.\n\nOverall, I love Caesars Palace and respect Bobby Flay, I just didn't love Mesa Grill.

Back last night and the food was just as awesome.....Mesa Grill gets it RIGHT!\n\nFor once, a restaurant where the portions are equal to the $35-$50 entree prices, but more importantly, the quality, flavor, and execution far surpasses it.  \n\nBRILLIANT:\n-Bread/Muffin basket.  Says volumes about a restaurant when they put so  much care in their nibbles.  My fav of the 4 different bread types was the blue corn muffin.  Dab of butter and you're done.\n-Honey Glazed Salmon.  Spiced and cooked to a perfect medium rare as requested.  Served on top of a yummy black bean puree.\n-Roasted Corn.  A side order of corn niblets baked in a cheesy/creamy/spicy sauce.  Not too heavy, but a great accompaniment.\n\nF-ING AWESOME:\n-Chipotle Glazed Rib Eye Steak.  WOW  WOW  WOW.  Best steak preparation I've had in a long time if ever.  Slightly charred and crispy on the outside and juicy and tender inside.  The glaze was not spicy at all, just light, smokey, and a tad sweet.  Sooo worth the $48 bucks.  As good as the salmon was, I stopped short of finishing it just so that I could have more Rib Eye.\n\nService was never under foot and timed well.  Can't wait to come back!"

This restaurant was close to five stars but the service let me down.\n\nWent as a group of four on a weekend night (with reservations). We still had to wait about 10 minutes but that is not out of the ordinary on a Saturday in Vegas. \n\nThe decor of the place is...unique. It's like some kind of post-modern-meets-old-southwest looks with colorful window tiles and earthy toned walls. Odd but cool. Anyways, the food was simply amazing. I can't remember anything I ate except for the Coffee Rubbed New York steak. That's because nothing else really mattered. It was a unique experience for steak and it was simply amazing. The sides that it came with were also amazing...wasabi mashed potatos and aspragus I believe. I loved it.\n\nThe one complain was with the service...it took our waiter about 40 minutes to bring us our check at the end of the night..which was enough to ruin it for most of group (I was still happy with the steak). Looking at other reviews, maybe this was a one-time blunder or a rare occurance, but I can only speak to what I saw.\n\nRegardless...good center-Strip location the Caesar's...good decor...and awesome Bobby Flay food!"

It\'s an interesting setting, but not really my style. The menu was--surprise--southwest, but with hints of new flavors, such as the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon with Spicy Black Bean Sauce or Spicy Chicken with Sweet Potato Hash. Vlad ordered the latter and I ordered the Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad (no goat cheese, vinaigrette on the side). \n\nAfter taking our orders, the table bread arrived, which IMO really was the highlight. The basket came with jalapeno cornbread, dried fruit scones, and blue corn muffins. . . rather than your average bread that looks and feels like it\'s been sitting out all day. Vlad and I really enjoyed the blue corn muffins - they were both sweet and savory all in the same bite. While we waiting for our mains, I looked over at the table next to me only to see the most gigantic burger ever. The Mesa Burger does not mess around! It looks like you literally have to dislocate your jaw in order to take one bite. Luckily the lady who ordered it cut it in half and shared with her man. In retrospect, maybe I shouldn\'t have been closely observing these poor patrons like they were lab rats? Whatevs, it\'s Vegas. \n\nVlad was pleased with his dish, while mine was a bit bland. After taking out the goat cheese and vinaigrette, there really is nothing to that salad but chicken and spinach. Actually, the chicken was atop a mini blue corn tortilla, but that\'s about it. I had to pull off the "sixteen spice" fat from each chicken strip, which I believe was intentionally included for "flavor". Once the fat was taken off, they were just season-less chicken strips. I think the waiter felt sorry for my substituted dish and brought out 3 vinaigrettes for me to add variety. It helped a little. The green onion one was the best tasting.  \n\nOverall, I\'d come here again for the festive table bread but will definitely order something else. Perhaps the Roasted Pumpkin Soup with Smoked Chiles and Pomegranate Crema?'

S"Bobby Flays Mesa Grill - this restaurant requires a credit to make a reservation. I checked in and the hostess didn't offer any smile or greeting. Just asked if my party was all here. I said three of us are here and the 4th is on his way. This information put her in an even more sour mood.\nWe sat down and waited 15 minutes and decided to order. Our waiter was also concerned about our late friend. I ordered the pork chops which was excellent. The Churros were ok but not transcendent . The late diner arrived right after we put in our order and quickly chose his dinner. \nFood was great but felt rushed and the whole dinner vibe was off. Yes we had one diner 15 minutes late but our reservations were 5:45pm not prime time dinner hour.\nNeed to work on customer service."

S'Loved it.  We went with another couple for dinner on a Saturday night.  We made reservations.. The service was top notch.  I usually am the one at the table that finishes her water and then waits...for more.  I never had more than two sips out of my glass before it was full again.  It was awesome.  The waitress was outstanding.  \n\nNow the food.\nThey brought a basket of bread and let me tell you I was in heaven.  There was a raisin nut bread, a jalapeno bread and corn muffins.  They were so good we asked for another basket and finished it. \n\nMy husband and I had margaritas, me peach, him the special agave nectar one.  They were good.\n\nWe had the TIGER SHRIMP+ ROASTED GARLIC CORN TAMALE which was fine.  I didn\'t like the tamale much but the shrimp and sauce were wonderful.  Next I had the GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS which were out of this world good.  I ate all of them save for the bites I gave around the table and it was a big portion...the tamale that came with it "meh" not so good but who had room for it.  My husband had the MANGO + SPICE CRUSTED TUNA STEAK and it was delicious too, not as good as my lamb but still really good.  Our friend had the black bean soup - which was delicious and he also had the taco dish which I can\'t find on their online menu but he didn\'t think much of it.  Our other friend had the chicken dish which is also not on the online menu and it was ok...it was chicken.  \n\nWe finished dinner off with the TOASTED COCONUT LAYER CAKE and it was so good I am now ruined for all coconut cake.  It had a coconut cream over the top of it and the layers were moist with I think a simple syrup.  It was so good.\n\nI want to go again as soon as possible.'

S'I think Bobby Flay gave me food poisoning...or at least his Mesa Grill did during a recent lunch.  This one-star review is because I became terribly ill after eating here.  I\'m going to contact the restaurant, but haven\'t yet as we just got back.\n\nI had the "Spicy Chicken, Sweet Potato Hash with poached eggs, green chile hollandaise".  It was decent but not exceptional. The waiter said it was the spiciest thing on the menu, but it didn\'t seem spicy to me at all.  I\'m wondering if the poached eggs is what made me ill.  \n\nMy cousin had the burger, and she liked it.  My husband had...well, I forget.  \n\nAnyway, I was very disappointed by my experience here.  I had looked forward to having lunch at Mesa Grill, and being sick for nearly two days because of a meal was not a rewarding experience.  I can\'t think of anything other than food poisoning given my symptoms, which I\'ll spare you.'

Cheap I know.\nGiven that Mr. Flay is an iron chef I just HAD to try out his cooking.\nThe restaurant is tex-mex so keep that in mind. I read that the shrimp tamales are the best thing to get here...but sadly I did not get it.\n\nThe bread basket was a nice perk as its not filled with your usual baguette or French loaf. It had blueberry bars, cookies, and mini biscuits. The dishes were carefully thought out and plated beautifully. \nI personally felt that the home fries (which are not french fries, btw) were a little tooooo salty.\n\nI admit that this place is pricey. You'll pretty much be spending $20 or more per person. But you are in Vegas! Splurge a little!"

S"I don't like to give 5 stars, but I almost did this time around.\n\nFirst off, I didn't know this was a Bobby Flay place and I say they did a good job. The decorations were fine and I liked the set-up. We had reservations and we were seated very promptly. The tables were decent sized.  The server was attentive, but sometimes way too much. I understand fine dining, but you don't want a pushy server. She was just overly attentive. I dug the way she threw in the merchandise they sell at the restaurant.  It's a hard thing to do at a fine dining place.\n\nThe menu... I personally thought the appetizers they had available were mediocre at best. I'd like more of a selection. We ended up with the Queso Fundido and it didn't disappoint. Even the bread that came out beforehand was quite yummy. I liked the cranberry type one.\n\nFor their entree's I was happy with the selections they offered. I was kind of stuck between the Salmon and the chicken. I usually don't order chicken when I eat out, but this time. It just sounded very good. WE both got it and wow. It's this 16 spice rubbed chicken with pest mash potatoes. It knocked my socks off! It was sooo good. And the portions were overwhelming. I got 2 acutal chicken breasts. I couldn't believe that! The 16 spice rub was delicious. The mash potatoes were delicious. I can't complain.\n\nWe took home half of our meal because we were stuffed. We skipped dessert.  There was no way I could eat any more.\n\nI'm buying the 16 spice rub online at their store - that's how much I liked it.  Ate the chicken the next day - still good, but a little dry. I can't complain.\n\nI'd go back!"

While at Caesar's we run across the MESA Grill and look at the menu, it looks like there are items we would give a shot.  \n\nThe decor is kind of contemporary with bright colors kind of yuppy-ish/tacky like a trendy bar out of Sex and the City.  I got the tuna and salmon tatares and my girlfriend got the pumpkin soup for appetizers.  I liked my tatare dish enough although it was kind of bland for the price and the spices were the ingredients that picked it up.  My girlfriend was dissapointed by the pumpkin soup because it tasted a lot like pumpkin pie mix.  \n\nFor the lunch entree, we ordered the Mesa Burger and the Sixteen Spice Chicken salad.  The burger itself wasn't memorable because...I really can't remember what it tasted like, but I loved dipping the fries into the horseradish sauce that came with the burger.  The salad disappointed my companion; the leaves were whole and were as big as your head and the dressing wasn't that great either."

Always love that. \nI had the seasonal soup, a bit pricey at $13.00 but oh so tasty - this time it was sweet potato with a touch of peanuts on the side. Then Sophie's chopped salad - romaine (not my favorite kind of lettuce - I prefer kale), black olives, a few bites of cheese, and tomatoes ($13.00). My husband had the Chiliquiles ($16) eggs, tortilla, jalape\xc3\xb1o and cheese.

In a rare moment I decided to go for the stuffed poblano Chile...OMG. . .This sucker was stuffed with eggplant. . .cheese - dusted with corn mean. . .before cooking. . .It might be the best vegetarian mean I have ever had.  My only suggestion would be to add something to the plate.  Some little side of rice or maybe a small piece of corn bread.  You are only served one (large) but it is kinds of lonely on the plate.  Hubby got salmon . . . he thoroughly enjoyed his mean as well.\n\nThis place is always crowded so make a reservation . . . The staff was aware that we had a show reservation and made every effort to accommodate our schedule even suggesting a back door exit to be nearer to the theater entrance.  \n\nMesa Grill has been at Caesars for a long time. It is consistently excellent.  I have seen many "glamour chefs" open and close restaurants on the Strip. . Not so with Bobby Flay and the Mesa Grill.'

S"I took my husband to Vegas for his 40th to fulfill two great desires - see Love (the Beatles Cirque du Soleil show) and eat at Bobby Flay's restaurant. I also made a reservation at the restaurant at the top of the Stratosphere which is one of the highest rated restaurants in Vegas. We canceled so we could eat at Mesa Grill again. \n\nYes Bobby Flay is all over Food Network, but he cooks to the flavor profile we prefer (and he's disdainful of Rachel Ray which makes me happy because she annoys the heck out of me). \n\nAmbiance: Modern with an nod to the Old West. Good for a romantic dinner, a professional meal, or an upscale meal with friends. They also have a private dining room. \n\nService: Best waiter I have ever had in my life. He could speak intelligently about the menu in the way a hardcore foodie or critic could (an accomplishment in an establishment that frequently changes their menu). He was present when you wanted him, an absent when you wanted some privacy. He was awesome. \n\nFood: Sex on a plate. In the realm of appetizers we had pumpkin soup and a lovely tartar plate of tuna and salmon with these AMAZING sauces. For entrees we had a 44 spice rubbed steak, lamb, chicken, and pork - all perfectly prepared and exquisitely seasoned. One of my favorite bites was a side dish of a sweet potato and chile tamale. \n\nPricing: Not cheap, but worth every dime. I've paid more for less enjoyable fare. I've rarely had more enjoyable food. \n\nThis place is in my list of top dining experiences of my lifetime. In fact, when we drive to New Mexico for the holidays, we are going to drive 4 hours out of our way just to eat dinner at Mesa Grill."

S'Mesa Grill\nThe restaurant decor is absolutely stunning. The wait staff is abundant and the place was teaming with high rollers and gorgeous people, then again why not, it\'s Bobby Flay\'s place, and it\'s in Caesars Palace.\nWe only had appetizers; I plan on going back for dinner later this year. \n\n$14.00 Goat Cheese "queso fondido" It had rajas and blue corn strips. I\'ve had better goat cheese, but the idea of goat cheese in fondido sparked my curiosity, unfortunately the dish did not satisfy my curiosity. The rajas were rajitas, meaning they were sparse. The blue chips were too thin, they broke when you dipped them into the fondido. Did I mention the presentation was awesome. \n\nNext we had Crispy Squash Blossoms $15.00. Filled with Ricotta Cheese, Corn and basil with yellow Haberno sauce. I think I remember 3 or 4 on the plate. It was the only appetizer we completely devoured. They were fresh, crisp and very tasty. Wish we had two orders of Blossoms. They reminded me of chile rellenos without the pepper. Encore!!\n\nNext was the Blue Corn Pancake $15.00. It had BBQ Duck and a habanero Chile -Star Anise Sauce. Nice idea, but someone spilled the Hosin sauce into the Habenero sauce and ruined the whole concept. The duck was on the dry side and the pancake tasted like a corn pancake. A little oil and butter in the batter would have done wonders to the pancake. Nice try, but it needs to be re-worked or change the price to two bucks. \n\nWild Mushroom Quesadilla, came with white bean hummus and white truffle oil. $14.00. Not a home run, but I would say at least a double. It was tasty and moist. Had some magic chile powder sprinkled on top of the tortilla that needs to be reformulated. A call to McCormick should remedy this. I think a little garlic-butter instead of the chile powder would have earned a triple with me. \n\nI\'m looking forward to going back sooner than later. The appetizers were good, but I can\'t wait to try the steak or lamb. I really love their open kitchen and the action behind the three dedicated grills in plain view for all the customers to witness their food being grilled fresh. \n\nI\'d estimate this place does 15 to 17 million in annual sales given the number of tables, the bar and the advance notice we had to give just to get a reservation.  Great Job Bobby! Rock On Dawg.'

We each ordered the highly acclaimed New Mexican spice rubbed tenderloin with bourbon-ancho chile and a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter.

S'I admit it. I\'m a foodie and I have high standards. I eat out a lot in New York. I\'d heard good things about the NYC Mesa Grill, so I figured this place would at least have some edible food. Error on my part.\n\nThe food bumps this review down to one star. The waitstaff could not have been nicer, which I why I\'m bumping it back up to two. But honestly, don\'t you usually go to a place like this for the food?\n\nThere are three sauces: an off-white one, an orange one and a dark brown one. Add some combination of these three to a meat or veggie substance and you\'ve got your entire menu. Creative, it ain\'t. Our party of eight tried just about everything.\n\nNot much flavor to the sauces or the dishes in general. Boring is the word that comes to mind. What kills me is that our waiter spent about half his time telling us "don\'t worry, nothing on the menu is spicy!" He might as well have said "don\'t worry, nothing on the menu is flavorful!" I have no problem with mild food, but it\'s a little weird at a southwestern themed restaurant.\n\nI can recommend the cactus pear cocktail though. That was tasty, and maybe after a few of them you won\'t notice the lack of flavor in the food.'

And I am SO glad that we did! They have the best ramen that I have had so far (in life). Oh my goodness! \nSo the restaurant itself would be best described as cozy... I wouldn't come strolling in 10+ people deep. Most of the seating appears to be surrounding the kitchen in a bar-like fashion. The menu is pretty basic and to the point - easy enough to order. You have a selection of noodles/ramen dishes to choose from... then you can add extras like egg, nori, etc. The basic ramen dishes are pretty filling themselves....but I added egg and nori for more flavor. Oh. My. God. It's like a flavor explosion. Maybe I'm not experienced enough in the ramen world.... but view become a bit obsessed trying it everywhere I go... and I'm not even exaggerating when I say that this is the best ramen I've had (so far).

S"I have previously mentioned that I subconsciously have high ramen expectations.  But for some reason, this place just somehow managed to smash that.\n\nI was first taken here on something of a whim.  We were going somewhere else, then the plans changed.  I'll admit, I was definitely not happy about it, as I know that any ramen place has a 90% chance of disappointing me.  But the second I walked in, I was taken aback to the tiny ramen shops back in Japan, with 1 long bar and a few tables.  Immediately my attitude changed for the good.  I looked at the menu, just 3 kinds of ramen, but you really don't need an exotic variety, just the ones you're really good at making.\n\nBeing kinda picky, I had ordered the Miso ramen, but with no mushroom or bamboo shoots, and added an egg and corn.  The soup came, and I did my usual broth test and was very surprised to find it was really good to me.  I added some sesame oil and went to town.  The egg was a nice addition, and the corn just reminded me of the food in Japan.  \n\nI was highly satisfied by the food and the place.  I will definitely be back again."

We ended up waiting a really long time for our seats.\n\nThis place is supposedly the best ramen place in Las Vegas. Came out here and expected it to be awesome. However my opinion wouldn't matter because I'm not Japanese so how would I really know if this place is legit? \n\nI ordered the spicy tonkotsu shoyu ramen with extra egg and pork. It was alright... Kinda meh. I expected more. This place is just an ordinary ramen place to me. \n\nWe came in as a group and asked for separate checks, but the worker didn't want to give us separate checks because apparently it was too complicated for her."

They put a lot of care into their food, which I under appreciated in my previous reviews. Yes, I still think service is sometimes a hit or miss, but lately its been great the past few times I've been here. Hopefully, this is just consistent and not my amazing luck. Also, they listened to their customers and opened up a new location in Henderson. I really appreciate restaurant owners who lend an ear to their customers and act accordingly.\n\nNot much else to say about Monta, if you are looking for ramen in Las Vegas, you've come to the right place."

I have not wanted to write this review because this place is like y secret treasure and very small. There is almost always await. The food comes out very fast it has a limited menu of Ramen noodles.  It is awesome. The fried rice is out of the park good.  The bowls of noodles are quite big and you pay like $7 bucks. You can't go wrong with that.  The wait staff is nice and fast.  I can eat here everyday since Ramen noodles are one of my favorite.  It is a bit out of the way for me plus its small and often packed. Definitely worth going and checking it out and even if you have never had Ramen (the pack for .25 cents in the grocery store does not count) for less then ten bucks its worth it try."

It like melts in your mouth and just has the right perfect amount of seasoning. =D\n\nRamen: FYI get extra chashu. You will not be disappointed! The meat is like a fluffy cloud pillow floating on your tongue til it melts down and it is just bomb dot com\n\nSpicy Tonkotsu - Spicy sauce. The broth was very good and flavorful. Spicy wasn't as spicy as I wanted it to be but it did give it a good flavor.\n\nKurobuta Ramen (black garlic oil) - Saltier I would say, it was still good. the broth was very flavorful, but I felt like it wasnt as garlicy enough, so I added some garlic and it was pretty good. \n\nOverall: Definitely would coem back.

I forget what the name was on the menu but it was so tasty.  It was packed with flavor when you eat.  It also had that refreshing taste to it.  You leave the restaurant, not sluggish, but having a refreshed feeling, which isn't normal.  Well to me at least!

Definitely wish there some chicken options. The price is great and the flavor is just right. It gets packed, so expect to wait, especially if you are more than two diners. On a warm Vegas night, you can't go wrong with some cold noodles and an ice cold Japanese beer. The gyoza is also pretty delicious and comes out exactly as pictured in the menu...every time! One of my favorite things about this place is the spicy horse radish mustard that comes on the side. It is made in house and unreal. Was not a fan of the pork belly bowl, a little too fatty and more rice than anything, but it looks like a crowd pleaser. They also have some typical Japanese canned beverages.

S'This is a tiny place that seats maybe 20 people and then another 8 or so at the counter bar area.  If you think you\'re going to be clever by getting there right when they open for lunch, you really need to get there right when they open, not 10 minutes after they open!  We arrived at 11:32am on a Saturday as a party of 5 and were the first guests and thought "Hey, that was easy! Maybe this place doesn\'t get that busy for Saturday lunch?"  Suddenly, over the next 5 minutes, several other parties of 2 or 3 people came in one right after another and the place was suddenly full!  If you arrived at 11:40am, you were then looking at a wait of 30-45 minutes until the initial parties were served, ate and left.  So go early!\n\nThe ramen was good.  I do wish they would give you more than 2 thin slices of roasted pork.  I don\'t know that I\'d go again if the wait was over 15 minutes though.

Once seated, however, I had a surprisingly generous amount of space -- didn't feel crowded like I do at some places.  On the recommendation of a friend, I had the kimchi fried rice and pot-stickers.  I liked them both.   I was a bit leery at first because the odor from kimchi made just about every other way is a real turn-off for me, but I had no problem with it in this case."

S"Monta, according to one of my friends who lived in Japan, is as close to authentic Japanese ramen as you can get in Las Vegas. I'll take his word for it.\n\nThe small ramen joint does not fit many and there is often a wait. Your entire group has to be there in order to be seated as well. There is a $10 minimum for card.\n\nThe waitresses are obviously experienced and seemlessly work together and with the chefs to efficiently serve customers. They are friendly, but not overly so. Food comes quickly as well because their menu is pretty small.\n\nMy usual order is a miso ramen with corn. The main reason I get corn is because the broth is a little too salty. Many people complain about this but I never really felt the extent of Monta's salty broth until the past year or so. It just seems thicker and more unhealthy than it used to be. I'm not sure if their recipes changed or if my tastes changed.\n\nYou get nori, chashu, and bamboo. Condiments you can add include garlic puree, pickled ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, sesame seeds, and chili powder. One thing that used to bother me when I first started coming here was that they only have green tea iced and in a can. \n\nThey also have a few other dishes besides the various ramen, including rice bowls, friend rice, cold noodles, and gyoza. For recent additions to the menu, they have the option to make your noodles spicy (+$1) or the kuro ramen, which is black garlic ramen. It's actually pretty tasty in my opinion, but I am an avid eater of garlic.\n\nRegardless of the heavy mouthfeel of the ramen, the consistent service and food keeps regulars like me coming back."

The staff is nice enough and the service is fine when it comes to refills or getting extra noodles for your broth. No one is overbearing, but they don't snub you either -- just right.\nAs far as the ramen, I had Tonkotsu-Shoyu with chashu, nori and shredded green onions. The broth was perfect and the chashu was tender with the right amount of fat. Ramen is considered to be Japan's ultimate comfort food, and I can see why."

I was soooooo relieved that Monta did not disappoint as I was also feeling a bit guilty for making my friend wait so long with me.\n\nTheir ramens are surprisingly good and the broth is flavorful, but not overly heavy. I ordered the tonkatsu broth with chashu and egg. The chashu was fork tender and I really appreciated that the yolk was not fully cooked. We also LOVED their Mentaiko bowl. The scallion, nori and touch of soy with the mentaiko was a match made in heaven. We went back on our last night in Vegas just to have it for the last time. \n\nMaking the trek to CT for Monta is so worthed it.

Personally, I don't think they deserve a 1 minute wait, never mind the craziness of 2 hours - and rude on top of that.\n\nI can only hope that Monta opens up a spot in NYC.

You can also get extra items like more pork, butter, corn, sliced egg, all make your soup even better.\n- Pork  Belly Over Rice is a winner, just like it sounds, the pork belly will melt in your mouth.\n- Gyoza is the best I have ever had!!\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and the service is quick and friendly.'

The noodles were perfect, the bowl came out immaculate. I did learn that as much as I LOVE animal fat, I am not a tonkatsu broth fan. There was too much black garlic oil in my bowl as it over-encompassed every bite, and I feel like it should have been more of a nuance... so I could barely eat half the bowl. \n\nBut I could see the quality and consistency (otherwise) in their food.

The flavor is spot on the depth nice light broth and depending if order additional topping can be hearty noodle dish. I prefer couple extras. Other thing find must really perfect compliment too big bowl of ramen is gyoza. It steamed perfectly then seared off on flat top too perfection and the filling is tasty. The gyoza sauce optional but must only way too have it combine together is divine. \n\nThey other sides I order the kim chee good but stand out is kim chee fried rice. It could ordered big bowl of that if they had it on the menu. =( It not over spicy but just the right amount of balance. They even have one beer offer on tap never think see small the place is never been good one too. I not remember name of it. Sorry.\n\nThe service is excellent.

Actually, the reason why I even decided to check this place out is because the day before I was at the Japanese Curry spot just a couple hundred feet away (in the same plaza) and noticed a long line at Monta Ramen. I was curious. Why were so many people waiting outside to eat ramen? Well, I needed to found out! So the very next day, my friend and I arrived around 11:15am (the place opens at 11:30am for lunch). There were already a few people in line waiting for the doors to open. I peeked inside. It's very small! There's only about 6 tables and a few seats at the bar. We got seated at 11:30am and when I looked out the window, there was already a line. \n\nWe ordered their top two special daily ramens: Spicy Tonkatsu and Black garlic Oil Kuro ramen. Both are fantastic! Very flavorful and unique! I've never tasted anything like the Kuro ramen before. Truthfully it looks gross cuz it's black and oil, but damn the ramen tastes soooo ono (good)!!!! The noodles are perfectly cooked, al dente! The service is fast and friendly (they kind of want you out of there quick, though! lol). \n\nIf you're ever in Vegas and you love ramen, you def have to check out Monta Ramen. You won't regret it!

S"My first experience with authentic Japanese ramen, and I was not disappointed. Prior to Monta, the only types of ramen I ate were in packages, cups and bowls, usually Korean in descent and instant in nature. So I was surprised, in a good way, when I discovered that Japanese ramen is nothing like the ramen I've eaten before. \n\nMy boyfriend was craving ramen for dinner, so I immediately suggested Monta Noodle House after remembering all the positive reviews on Yelp. We entered the restaurant and, thankfully, they had a table for two available. The restaurant itself is small, reminiscent of an authentic ramen house in Japan (at least in my mind). Service was friendly and quick given the ratio of servers to customers. \n\nAfter reading over the menu, he ordered the Miso Ramen with extra char siu and a Mini Mentaiko while I ordered the Tonkotsu/Shoyu Ramen and an order of Gyoza. Here is the breakdown of the food:\n\nGyoza- Hot pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings with just the right amount of crisp from the charred skin which contrasted well with the soft and juicy meat filling. Overall, very good and savory. \n\nMiso Ramen- He enjoyed his ramen, saying that it tasted very authentic. I tried some of his ramen, and while I preferred the broth of his ramen, I liked the thinner noodles from my ramen more. \n\nMini Mentaiko- He enjoyed this as well. I think it was the perfect light contrast to the heavy ramen. \n\nTonkotsu/Shoyu Ramen- Delicious! The noodles were perfectly cooked, and the vegetables added texture and mildness to the rich broth. My only complaints are that the broth was just a tad too salty for my taste and the char siu lacked the meatiness I wanted. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed dinner that night. I enjoyed my experience there so much that two days after my initiation into the Japanese ramen world I went again with my mom."

S"I've been a regular at Monta for a few years now.I recommened the Tonkotsu or the Tonkotsu-shoyu.I really enjoy the Tonkotsu broth.I like to order extra Chashu pork along with ni-tamago (boiled egg).Montas Ramen noodles are good also,not like some other places that seem like they busted the noodles out of a package(Not that I think all packaged Ramen is bad).So if you want to try out Ramen for the first time or you just want good ramen ,I recommend Monta.Oishi!"

S"This tiny little ramen place was everything it was cracked up to be.  My parents live locally and they'd heard from several sources about how great this place was, so when we were visiting, we took them out to Monta.\n\nWe managed to get there at the perfect time because only 1 table was occupied, so getting my dad in was quick and easy (he is in a wheelchair).  They don't have hot drinks, so enjoy some UCC Oolong or Green Tea or a can of Calpico (I wish they had UCC Iced Coffee!!)  We placed our order and watched as the crowd built up very quickly.  Food arrived fast and piping hot.\n\nThe gyoza was fine - crunchy on one side, steamed on the other, hot all the way through.  My mom and hubs got the pork belly bowls and my dad and I got the miso ramen (I got mine with corn)\n\nThe charsiu/chashu/chasyu (how ever you want to spell it) WAS SO AMAZING - I do not use this phrase lightly.  It was LITERALLY melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  The pork fat was flavorful and rich and just melted away when it hit your tongue.  So amazing!  I am sad that I didn't stop and order a side of it immediately.\n\nThe ramen noodles had a great chewy texture and the miso broth was delicious.  My mom was very pleased with the pork belly bowl, as well.\n\nThe only thing that didn't live up to everything else was the mentaiko bowl.  I got it because I love hot rice and tarako (and my mom had made some for me the night before and I was still jonesing for it).  Unfortunately, the rice was not very hot and a little on the dry side, so the bowl was disappointing.  I ladeled some of the miso broth into the bowl and that made the rice more palatable, but it messed with the flavor of the mentaiko.\n\nAll in all, it was a great experience and I can't wait to go to Vegas again so I can go to Monta again! \n\n**ACCESSIBILITY NOTE - The parking lot is not very wheelchair friendly and Monta itself can be a little tight to try to get a wheelchair in and out.  The only wheelchair ramp up from the parking lot is blocked by the car when you park in the handicapped space, so once you get the person into their chair, you have to move the car to get them up to the sidewalk level where the restaurants are."

S"This is another go to lunch spot for us. Spring Mtn restaurants are close to his work so we frequent them every so often. This is one of our faves!!\n\nThey open at 1130AM. But don't wait to come then get there before! There is always a line by 1115-1120 when I usually am nonchalantly rushing to the line in fear I'll miss my window of opportunity to enjoy my oh so fabulous bowl of noodles. It is small and fills up fast and they don't seat you unless your whole party is there which sends me into another panic until The boyfriend shows up and I can breathe again. Also they only seat singles at the bar heads up, no table for you, no room for your laptop, this is not a working lunch spot. In and out. Once you're done you'll feel the eyes stating at you till you leave with your head down feeling like you might have taken just a little too long to enjoy your grub. \n\nThe service is always spot on and fast. Sometimes they ask if its ok sometimes not, I don't care though its always good! Sometimes being the first customers the wait for the food is sometimes sluggish with all the orders going in at once but I understand and gives us time to chat and admire the others. I always get my Ramen with corn and butter hold the shrooms. Yea I know they're not poisonous but these shrooms are just weird to me. The Boyfriend gets the Pork Belly Bowl and always shares generously, we'd have a fight on our hands if he didn't. This thing is to die for! Yummy baconey porky deliciousness! You won't regret it!"

S"we ate here twice in 3 days! the first time we actually came to eat at the snowflake shavery for dessert, but noticed the crowd milling around monta and decided to throw our name on the waiting list. since we had our baby in tow, we weren't exactly expecting to wait it out. however, the woman working at monta was so incredibly nice, she save us a table and made it as comfortable as possible for the baby, even helping us store the stroller in the back! now to be honest we weren't incredibly hungry after the wonderful shavery but we managed to still enjoy my tonkotsu and shoyu ramen with the egg and my wife the black garlic oil flavored kuro ramen. I've definitely had better egg in my time so next time I'd try some other add on.\n\nwhile the food was good, the service was what stuck in our minds that first night. nicest wait staff ever! we also vowed to take my noodle loving 10 year old nephew and my sister when they rolled into town the next day.  \n\nso today we went around lunch time, and longer line so again we hit the snowflake shavery first! while waiting, we saw the flyer that they opened a monta in henderson! we'll definitely try that next. This time the wait was longer and we worked up our post-snow appetites...and score! the nephew and sister loved it! also i tried the takana fried rice this time which I thought was great. Just the right amount of spiciness and with the mustard green, unique from chinese fried rice. my better half had the shoyu ramen this time, which was indeed lighter than the tonkotsu broth. I think I preferred the tonkotsu but it was good to have tried them both.\n\nnext stop will definitely be the one near my parents house on eastern. thanks yelp for the recommendation!"

S"This place was such a good find. Never had been here before and we just searched up a Ramen place to try (since our favorite ramen joint closed down) and I would have to say that Monta Ramen is probably our new favorite. Their menu is small and simple, which I like because then I don't have to sit there forever trying to decide which one I want to order. I was able to see what they have and decide what I wanted quickly. We ordered the Tonkatu Shoyu and added an egg (extra $1.00-$1.50) and it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO yummy! We also ordered their fried rice and gyoza. All was delicious. \n\nThe only downfall I have is that it is such a small restaurant that many people enjoy going to, so if you're there on a busy night.... most likely there will be a wait for a while and you'll be stuck waiting outside. (No inside seating area, hardly)\n\nIt was definitely worth the wait for us though. We enjoyed eating here and will be back again for sure."

Great broth, but wasn't a big fan of the thinner noodles, but they were very good. my friend got the shoyu one.. wished I had gotten that one.

S"Very nice noodle house.  Good service, quaint layout, and the price can't be beat.\n\nI'm struggling giving it another star because I noticed somethings in the 20 minutes I was there to make you go hmmmm.  You heard me 20 minutes to get in, order a shoyu ramen and asahi and get out.  Can't beat that for efficiency.\n\nMenu is straight and to the point, if you are not here for Ramen, go somewhere else.  Broths are Tonkatsu, Shoyu, and Miso.  Shoyu is the base for me (kinda like vanilla ice cream).  Soup comes standard with a few thin slices of roast pork, green onions, bamboo shoots, and some seaweed.  The noodles were decent but not homemade, very stock machine made ramen.  I like my ramen al dente, these were not.  I did add the pat of butter for $.50 which was a nice addition, but totally over priced.\n\nSat at the bar so had full view of kitchen and how things were prepared.  Didn't like how the cooks did not sanitize very well, bare hands on food doesn't bother me, but when you grab an egg and some  pork slices, I'd like to see you wash them hands before moving on to the next order.  Also noticed their Kim Chee was out of a bottle, which they could have done a better job at concealing if they kept it towards the back.\n\nIf you are looking for a nice spot to get your ramen on, I would totally suggest going here.  Keep your party to 4 or less otherwise it would be a stretch to find seating for everyone."

S"I'm no ramen guy. Actually, this is my first experience with true ramen from a restaurant. It definitely met my expectations. I got the tonkotsu-shoyu ramen on my friend's advice, and I also split some fried rice. Loved the rich broth, the texture of the noodles, and the way that the chashu (which isn't like what I'm used to) just melted away in my mouth. I can see how some people would complain of saltiness, but I liked it just fine. The fried rice was also delicious, although it did seem pricey for, you know, fried rice.\n\nI was surprised at first by how small the place is, but after it became apparent that this is a spot for a quick meal, including rapid filling of orders, I saw how they could get away with it. You definitely shouldn't pick this place if you wanna linger around for an hour or more."

S'I am a true ramen foodie: lived in Japan for 16 years. The ramen at Monta is the same quality as the instant cup ramen I buy in Japan. The chashu is tender, but too fatty and the noodles are not of restaurant quality. \nThe last time I was here, I found a sign on the door asking customers to close the door behind them quickly for their AC system was not keeping up. On a hot 106 degree day in Vegas, the last thing I want to do is eat hot ramen in a hot restaurant. The place was definitely a little too warm. Beware!'

S"If you're craving for a steaming bowl of ramen, this place is IT! \n\nNow I only gave them 4 stars as I wish they would expand even just a tad. Seating is so tight but I guess it also adds to highlight of when your name is finally called and you sit on their wooden chairs and get served almost immediately. The menu consists of 4 simple but very different ramen bowls and a few add ons and very minimal side dishes. But so much easier to choose from.\n\nLove the Tonkatsu Shoyu ramen. I order mine with thick noodles instead which are seeped in pork AND chicken broth. DOUBLE the flavor. I make sure to always order extra chasyu (pork) although all ramen bowls come with 2 slices.\n\nLove the slurp of the noodles and melt in your mouth pork. Slices of mushroom are added as a garnish but even that helps enhance the flavor.  This is only my second time here but I enjoy it immensely and even more so that I got to share it with 9 of my other friends...at the same time! :)"

S'Their pork. That chashu pork, oh my god. K first of all it\'s like my crack when I\'m in Vegas; it\'s the first thing I hunt down when I get here. It\'s like the most amazing thing I\'ve tasted in my entire freakin\' life.\n\nThe restaurant is quite a modest noodle house, very small, and they have a simple menu. It seems this kind of place would just be something to overlook. But NO. Their ramen is the best ramen I\'ve had.\n\nTheir broth is very rich and flavorful-- I\'ve been to ramen houses were they put a lot of salt and MSG in the broth for its lack of flavor--not here! Very rich. Noodles were not too hard nor too soft, just right in the middle.\n\nBut, the pork. Dear god the PORK\n\nNext time I go I will get extra chashu pork in my soup. Their pork literally just falls apart. I\'ve had soft pork before, but that was because I\'d get nothing but cuts of fat. Here, the meat is so tender and flavorful. I don\'t know what they do to it, but it\'s just downright amazing.\n\nEach one of us got a different bowl of ramen they offered, so we pretty much ordered the whole ramen menu. Each one is delicious. Their shoyu (soy sauce broth) is the original ramen, but it is very delicious. I enjoyed mine. Everything else was delicious as well.\n\nWe got a chashu bowl, and it was a simple bowl of chashu pork with rice over it, but it was just the best thing ever. The pork is so amazing, I could go on and on about it forever.\n\nTheir kimchi rice is also quite good! Not too spicy, but it does give a kick.\n\nYou really can\'t get anything "bad" or "ok" here; everything on the menu is amazing.\n\nOur group of friends were rock climbers and just got done climbing in Red Rocks for the day, so they were quite famished. We each ordered one bowl of ramen to ourselves, split a chashu pork bowl, one plate of gyoza, and one plate of kimchi fried rice, but they decided to get extra noodles. Nope, even famished rock climbers could barely finish what we got. And the price we paid for was so small for the generous helping of delicious food we got!\n\n5 stars for Monta! Cheap prices, excellent food, and great service.'

And I absolutely did with the Tonkotsu Ramen here- enjoyed it a lot!\n\nThe broth had hearty pork flavor and thick, creamy consistency, noodles were QQ- had the right amount of springy texture and chewiness to it, egg and Chashu Pork cooked perfectly. Everything blended really well together in flavor and texture. Anddd, what you get for the price makes it that much better! Super affordable and delicious always makes for a great meal!\n\nThe fried rice was one of my favorites as well. It's one of those dishes you will end up craving after you leave. Just get it when you go, trust me. I was hesitant when my friend ordered it because it's just fried rice- I could make that at home, right? I ended up eating most of it and left wanting more. \n\nI've been patiently waiting for Monta to open in Richardson and when it does, I hope it's just as good as it was in Vegas. Can't wait!"

Due to limited seating and people seeming to socialize with their friends, the wait time may be ridiculous.\n\nThe food is great, but their should be a plan to keep the flow moving.

Forget that! \nConsidering this would be my PFGT\'s experience with quality ramen, I punched in best ramen on Google and Monta came up.  Typical ramen shop.  Small and yet comfortable.  Just after lunch but was still 90% full but sat almost immediately in the corner table. Perfect.  I ordered Asahi, gyoza, Tonkutsu Shoyu Ramen for me and Miso Ramen for her.  Gyoza came out first and that was decent gyoza.  Ramen came in about 10 minutes.  The smell was outrageous but that first taste before I added the 3 pepper blend was insane!  I told my PFGT, "This is Ramen!" Her Miso Ramen was just as good.  Needless to say, down to the last slurp of the broth, I would definitely go back!  Prices are fantastic!'

There's a little bench in front of the restaurant that had at least four people sitting on it and three more people waiting. \n\nWhen we got there, we were seated immediately. The place was very small and tight, but there was definitely a Japanese feel to it. I ordered the Shoyu ramen with cha shu pork and green onions. Gerald had the same thing but instead of the green onions, he added a soft boiled egg (after I saw his, I wanted an egg too!!!) The service was quick, pleasant and honestly, was what was expected. I was not disappointed. \nAs for my ramen...it was delicious!!! It was the perfect temperature, had just enough flavor and hit the spot!! I only had two disappointments: \n\n1) The limited menu - I enjoyed what I had, but I think I would have liked to see more choices. \n2) Feeling rushed - not by the staff, but by the people who were waiting. They just stood by my table and I felt like they were rushing us because their party was seated right next to me. Not the restaurant's fault, but perhaps they should come up with a seating system or take reservations for large parties or peak periods. \n\nI will definitely try this place again! I give my ramen 4 stars, but until I try something else on their menu, I'll stick with my 3. Yummy ramen if you're craving it!"

Nothing too fancy for just getting a good wholesome bowl of Ramen \n\nSee below my lunch meal after a crazy night in Vegas.  Everything is an additional w/cost.   \n\nMiso Ramen 7.25 \nPork Broth w/thin noodles (you can choose between chicken or pork broth, thin or wide noodles) \n\nSpecial toppings for your Ramen:\nChasu Pork $2.50\nSpicy $1.50\nShreeded Green Onion $1.50\nSeasoned hard boiled egg $1.50\nTakana Mustard Leaf  $1.50\nCorn .50\n\nOther: \nGyoza $5.50\n\nSo this place is off the strip, you would need to take a cab here.  It is located in the Chinatown area of Vegas.  We waited for about 45mins, got seated and went straight into ordering our meal.  The service was fast.  Ingredients on the ramen are placed on top, but before I mixed everything altogether I tried the broth and it was very good.   Adding the ingredients of the spicy sauce, Mustard Leaf and Chasu in Pork broth made the soup just way too salty for me to eat it.  I really wish the server would had informed me that this would have happened.  Otherwise, the Chasu was really tender and the thin noodles were not too overwhelming.  Everything in the bowl was well portioned. Then I had the gyoza, it just tasted like any frozen gyoza purchased at a super market.  Overall, I would come back here and not make the same mistake by ordering too many salty add ons in my ramen.'

I didn\'t even end up getting ramen just because I didn\'t want to bloat and be all big before going out. I went with the Regular Fried Rice. I mean there wasn\'t anything amazing about it. It was like ordinary rice that I could\'ve whipped up myself! \n\nMy gf got the ramen. The broth was okay. I\'ve had better. The noodle on the other hand was super fresh. It had a crisp to it when you bit into it too. \n\nThe cool thing about our experience was we sat at the bar so we were able to see the chefs prepare all the ramen bowls and cook the meats and what not. What bothered me the most about this place is its efficiency and service. They are super slow and move like ants here!

S"The restaurant is pretty small and they are almost always packed. So get there right when they open if you don't want to wait. If you like thin straight noodle, get their tonkotsu ramen. One of the best bowls of ramen you'll ever find anywhere especially in Vegas. Parking is pretty sparse so it can be a gamble finding a parking spot."

S"Fantastic! I've eaten ramen is numerous ramen houses in Japan and the US. Monta is delicious! Most ramen houses are very small and have a long wait due to their popularity and greatness. So I was prepared to wait. Lucky for me I came at the perfect time and didn't wait long!\n\nI had the miso ramen and goza! Their gyoza was made to order and prefect! The miso ramen was awesome! Broth was balanced with just enough miso to make it perfectly creamy how I like it! :) I got all the toppings and they came in big portions and complimented my ramen well. This is one of my new favorites for ramen! \n\nVery nice prices and worth the wait if there is a line! Try it!!"

The noodles were good, & so was the fried rice. But the pork made me gag, and I normally like pork.\n\nNot what I was expecting. Neither of us would go back."

S'Ordered the kim chi fried rice, green tea (did not expect it to be in a can), and a light brothed ramen noodle soup with pork belly, shredded mustard greens, bamboo shreds, and black mushroom strips. The pork belly was first class, the rest of the soup was too salty for my taste...I can imagine that it would have been perfect with 50% less salt. The kim chi fried rice was also a little salty. For the price, the overall quality was only soso. \n\nOh, I also ordered gyoza, which was just average at best.\n\nI will say that the atmosphere seemed authentic and very Japanese with the cute waitresses screaming the orders to the kitchen in Japanese.\n\nIf the food were less salty, this place could easily get at least 4 stars.'

S"Attention: This is NOT the ramen you ate in college, it's about 1000x better.  The Tonkatsu I had tonight was delicious, and the pork they serve with it was flavorful, buttery, and fell about when you tried to pick it up, in other words, perfect.  The noodles were done perfectly, to what most would consider al dente, and held up really well to the broth.  I got a side of kim chi to go with it, and they paired really nicely.  It's a small restaurant in the back of a strip mall in Chinatown, but if you don't mind the drive and maybe missing it once or twice, I would say you need to go here at least once to try good ramen if you haven't had it before."

S"I'm so glad my gf found this place on yelp for our final lunch at Vegas!\n\nWe ordered:\n- Tonkatsu Ramen: Absolutely wonderful smooth & milky pork-based broth. My favorite ramen is at shin sen gumi, and this bowl of ramen was very comparable, if not better. I also added toppings of a hard boiled egg and extra slices of pork - they gave 6 extra slices in addition to the two slices of pork that came with the bowl by default. I decided to avoid the kimchi because I didn't want the Korean toppings to dominate the Japanese broth. Noodles were cooked perfect, and you can order extra noodles for $1.50.\n- Shoyu Ramen: This is the darker one, I believe it's miso/soy based. My gf had this, and I tried the broth and it seemed equally as delicious.\n- Gyoza: It's like lightly grilled potstickers\n- Fried Rice: typical fried rice as expected - not something to die for, but good.\n- Kimchi Fried Rice: Pretty much exactly like the fried rice, except that it had a bit of the tangy flavor that the kimchi added\n- Pork bellow bowl: This was my favorite out of the fried rice bowls. Lightly cooked, tender, moist and juicy pork belly strips layered on top of white rice. Definitely worth getting along with the ramen.\n\nService was fantastic. Our group of 5 was sixth on the waitlist, but it moved pretty fast; we waited maybe about 20 or so minutes.\n\nCliff Notes: Tonkatsu Ramen with hardboiled egg and extra pork. Pork Belly bowl."

S'As an avid lover of all Asian styles of food I was excited to finally try Monta Ramen since I had heard good things. At first glance it looked like this little noodle shop was going to have a very long wait. However, we did not have to wait too long even with people waiting outside. There are not many seats, but this is not really the place to linger for long. Most people seem to leave fairly quickly once they are done. My friend and I sat at the counter and had fun watching the bustling kitchen while we waited for our ramen. The seating may feel cramped for some people, but I really liked the busy, controlled chaos feel of it. \n\nOn to the good stuff. I ordered the Tonkotsu-Shoyu ramen with the regular house fixings and my friend had the Shoyu ramen with thin noodles. I was instantly impressed with my choice as soon as I tried it. The broth was slightly creamy and full of flavor, the thin noodles cooked to the perfect point so they were not mushy at all. I found the soup very flavorful, but I had to add a liberal amount of chili oil since I like my ramen spicy. The Shoyu ramen was also very tasty, the clear beef broth had just as deep a flavor as my selection. We both had a can of green tea to drink, which was a refreshing counter to my spicy soup. My only gripe was the fact that I was not completely full when I left, which is mostly my own fault. They offer the option of extra noodles, which I will surely do next time. The gyoza and fried rice are also on the list to try in the future. \n\nAnother great aspect is the price. The total bill for two bowls of ramen and two drinks was $18 and change. A great deal for any sit down place. Bottom line is that this place is a great option for a fun, cheap meal. I will definitely be going back.'

S"Holy crap..this place was good.\n\nI went there around lunch time and the place looked like it was going to blow up.  The restaurant is very small and it was jampacked.  I'm talking like elbows to elbows.This might annoy some people, but in a way I found it to be charming and like any standard ramen venues you will find in Japan.  It's as real as it gets, as for the venue at least.  As for the ramen, it gets even better.\n\nI waited about 10-15 minutes, sat down, placed my order and waited for about 10 minutes for the ramen to come out.  Not bad, considering there was a lot people in the restaurant.\n\nThe ramen was so, so tasty.  Not too hot, the noodles were juicy, and the soup was not salty nor sweet.  I have tried Japanese ramen many times in the past, and I notice that the ramen is ruined because the ramen is too salty or there's too many damn vegetables floating around.  Luckily, for the ramen here at Monta, it was all love.  I had the Tonkotsu-Shoyu, and it was pretty damn good.\n\nThe service was speedy, but great nonetheless.  The waitress took our orders, filled our waters, and gave me the check as soon as I asked for it.  All in all, great experience.\n\nI wanna point out that this is a ramen house, so don't expect a variety in their menu.  They have some chicken bowls and gyozas, yeah, but nothing like sushi or whatever.  You won't be wanting it anyway, the ramen steals the show.\n\nPRO: The ramen is great, service is speedy, food comes out quick\nCON: May get a bit crowded, might have to wait 10-30min on peak hours"

S"I am no connoisseur on Japanese food or ramen, but this place really has me addicted lately.  I found it while browsing reviews on Yelp, and Yelp was right on target!  \n\nThe place is quite small, seating maybe 30 people, including the bar.  During lunch, there is a wait to get seated.  The cooks are out in the open, similar to the sushi bar trend.  I've always had good service, although sometimes there is a little bit of a communication problem... my English isn't so good sometimes! ;-)  But that's never annoyed me because I love the soups here.\n\nSo far I have only tried the Tonkatsu. I ordered with extra pork, egg, and (I know, shame on me), butter.  you can also order extra noodles if you aren't a big broth eater.  The Tonkatsu is, I believe, a pork based broth.  Its thick (for a broth), a little salty (but not too salty), and very flavorful.  The pork was cut very thinly, and was so juicy, almost buttery.  I barely had to chew it.  Now, I am no expert in homemade noodles or anything, but the noodles for me were quite good... filling and tasty.  \n\nI can't wait to try the other two main ramen dishes they have.  I know now isn't the perfect time for hot ramen, but I'll make an exception to that rule for this place any time!"

S"Amazing!  And I have to say some of the best pork I've ever had at a ramen restaurant.  It's unctuous and meltingly tender!\n\nSo hubby and I are sort of ramen fanatics and have had ramen all over the ramen hot spots in the US- Ippudo and Totto Ramen in NYC; Daikokuya, Tsujita, Ramen Jinya, Santouka, Hakata Ramen, Mottainai in LA.\n\nAnd this place is probably the best ramen we've had, perhaps second to Totto ramen.  Their tonkotsu- shoyu ramen is awesome, I love the mix of the pork and chicken flavors.  They cook the noodles just right, and of course, the pork is to die for.  I also love how cheap the ramen is.  \n\nThis place made me so happy after our 9 hour crazy traffic filled ride from LA!"

S"I'm not a big fan of Monta, maybe it's because I get sick every time I come here and eat something with the charsui (which I figured out after I was about to give up). Everyone else claims it's the best ramen in Las Vegas, maybe, but I haven't been to enough places around to say for certain just yet. So far it's a no for me, because of the way I get sick.\n\n\nGrowing up in Japan with a Chinese family, I know what good ramen tastes like and they're decent but when they're busy the noodles are hard (not cooked long enough) which I hate, they have to be consistant! And on top of that I can't eat the charsui without getting sick which then it's game over for me for the day, so it usually ends with me giving it away to someone. \n\nSo like I said, when it's busy they're not that consistant because they're trying to keep up with the demand and not be slow, but it shows in their cooking. I always get gyoza with my ramen and would feel weird if I didn't! Something I've done since I was a little child, besides the pair together taste great! \n\nThe soup base itself is light as it should be, though sometimes I feel it's a bit salty (maybe my Asian taste buds were a little too active then, but it's good. Also depends on the one you want, I'm pretty traditional and don't stray from the shoyu (soy sauce base). The noodles is a hit and miss, since they're usually busy and rarely not, though I like going when most people aren't eating, the noodle can be either perfect or too hard for me. People like their noodles differently and not many places give you an option (very few in Japan do), but like I said hit and miss usually it's okay. \n\nOutside of their regular toppings you can add extra stuff like corn, butter, green onions, etc for some extra costs which isn't much at all! They also have kaedame which is a second helping of noodles, but you need to leave some soup base and not drink it if you're going to do that.\n\nOverall the price for what you get is decent and not too bad especially comparing it to places in Japan. My only complaint is that the charsui gets me sick every time I've eaten it and since I've stopped it's been okay."

S'I must say, out of all the ramen places I\'ve tried, Monta definitely sticks out. I\'ve had ramen from NorCal, SoCal, and New York. I don\'t call myself very knowledgeable but I sure as hell know what I like to eat. The best ramen place that I\'ve tried is Ippudo, which is located in Manhattan NY. However, Monta does come close.\n\n\nMonta is quite a small restaurant and it has one of those homely feels to it. One thing I didn\'t quite like was how stuffy it was. I went during one of the warm days, it wasn\'t even hot, but all they had was fans and I couldn\'t even feel them. So the place had pretty poor circulation and stuffy. I\'d hate to see what it\'s like during an actual summer temperature where it hits over 100 degrees. \n\n\nI had their tonkotsu ramen with corn -- definitely recommended. Their broth is rich and full of flavor. It is yummy. However, because of how rich and yummy the broth is, I don\'t suggest adding an egg to it. Because once you do, the egg loses its flavor and the broth overpowers it. So no point. \n\n\nI would\'ve given this place five full stars if it were not for the waitress that helped us. Oh the service was fine throughout our meal. When we first took our orders down, she offered us, "Would you like everything on one check or split checks?" We were a party of 8. Obviously, some had cash and some didn\'t so we would prefer the latter. So we answered with, "Split checks would be nice :)" But then she responds with, "I could do that but could you please not do 8 separate checks? It\'s a little bit too much."\n\nI\'M SORRY? Really, why did you even bother to offer? \n\nI didn\'t feel like arguing or bothering so we just went with one check. You don\'t offer something then take back your offer. Or at least lay your own terms down before you finish offering. Thank you. \n\n\nBut hey. Food\'s good. :) Just that tiny bit irked me.'

Their place is rather small and it's quite popular, so if they could just get another bigger location or something, it would be perfect. Sometimes there's a long wait, so it's a hassle to sit outside in the heat, but once we're in, and we have our food, it's all worth it! The food is inexpensive and delicious! I only want to also add that if your order is less than $10 or something, you cannot use your card, which was a huge inconvenience for me twice when I went."

S'Very good place to go after partying all night... The ramen fills the stomach and helps the burn of alcohol. I like how they kept the place small so it had an authentic Japanese ramen house feel. Food is inexpensive and the wait is not as bad as other ramen places I have visited. The meat just melts in your mouth and has a very soft texture. You can order the noodles hard if you want to help with the hangover from raging all night.  The style of the ramen is very similar to the ones I had in Fukuoka japan.

It's a bit saltier than the miso and tonkotsu versions, but at the same time it also had the most pork flavor, making for a delicious combo with the chashu.

S"I was told on several occasions that Chinatown was the place to eat in Vegas. I didn't believe it until I took the first bite at Monta.\n\nIt was a chilly day, and nothing could beat the satisfaction found at the bottom of that ramen bowl. Monta is tucked in a small strip small. There's limited seating inside, but we didn't wait long at all and sat at the bar. I actually prefer this since we could watch the kitchen in action.\n\nEverything is EXTREMELY affordable. I got a huge bowl of ramen (with a few addition) for the same price as 1 fancy hot dog on the strip. I opted for the Tonkotsu and added corn and egg. We also had the Gyoza to start. The Gyoza were perfect, so light and airy. Dipping them in a mix of soy with sesame oil with a dash of their spices made it that much better. The bowl of ramen was huge! I tried to force myself to finish it because it was so good. I was going to add spices to the broth, but it was fantastic on its own so I didn't mess with it. The noodles were soft and the egg was the perfect addition. I wish I could have another bowl right now with this cold outside!\n\nWhat I also enjoyed about this restaurant was the design. It wasn't the typical meh photo with a description underneath. They took the time to take beautiful photos of all their dishes and explain them appropriately. It really makes a difference.\n\nThe staff was nice. The place was busy and they kept everything on pace. I will definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas."

S"As comfort food goes, Ramen can be such a go-to meal when it's cold outside (We both sweat WAY TOO MUCH to be slurping noodles in mega hot molten lava broth in the summer)! So during the colder months, we make our way as much as possible to Monta for Ramen\n\nIt's tiny noodle shop, the counter seats ten and five table tops that seats twelve total.  It's open until late at night and it cranks out people like no one's business-prety much there's always a waiting list to get into this place!\n\nAnd it is well worth it,  the Ramen is some of the best that we have had, (and that includes Japan!  Gasp! Horror! Blasphemy!) but it's true-we went to Hide Chan Ramen in Fukuoka and the broth wasn't as good as Monta's!\n\nAs we always do, there's a couple of things that we order and not much else, (it's hard to venture out when you know a dish is that good).  We start the Japanese journey with an order of the Gyoza; these pork dumplings are perfectly cooked, a crunchy charred exterior that holds in the moist juices of the pork.  Add Sujoyu, (a mixture of Vinegar and Soy Sauce) Rayu (Chili Oil) and some raw garlic, dip these little moon shaped suckers in it and pop' em in your pie hole! \n\nAfter you've wet your appetite, it's time move onto the Main Event; the Ramen.  As is, we're partial to the Tonkotsu (Pork Bone) Ramen- the broth is made from simmered Pork Bone, Fat and Collagen which gives it its super rich, almost creamy soup that can easily fill you up and warm your body.  It's most definitely the most satisfying noodle soup on this planet.  And especially since this is a Kyushu dish, (Fukuoka is on the  island of Kyushu) I'm particular to the flavor.  (Japan based on its regions have different tastes and styles to the same dish).  \n\nMonta's Tonkotsu Ramen recipe is from Kurume, (not far from Fukuoka) so it's really close to my heart.  Which is why you won't see me ordering the other Ramen, (there's Shoyu, Miso and Tonkotsu-Shoyu).  One of these days, We'll get to them......\n\nThere's a couple of add ons and I would definitely go and order an extra Chashu, (Roasted Pork) these tender slices of heaven are as much as a main character as the Noodles and Broth.  Getting to the Noodles, have you ever had anything better than Ramen Noodles? They're just so unique; chewy and Monta really cooks them right.  We also get the Nitamago, (cooked egg) Takana, (Mustard Leaf) and sometimes Nori, (Seaweed) -the egg for extra protein, the Takana for the vegetable and crunch and Nori for the contrast in texture.  You can also order an extra helping of Ramen Noodles (Kaedama) if you have extra broth, but there's no way I have ever had enough room for that!!!\n\nIn the Summertime, they serve Hiyashi-Chuka (Cold Chinese Noodles). It's refreshing and cold perfect for the summer with bits of Ham, Cucumber, Bean Sprouts, Takana, Nori and Sesame Seeds over Ramen noodles in a light Soy; it's the best on a hot day!!!\n\nI forgot to mention the Rice bowls that they serve as well; I'm not the biggest fan of these bowls but that just me- a lot of people rave about them!  I know what I like and I'm happy staying on my side of the menu if you know what I mean...The service here is excellent, the waitresses are terribly polite and the the food comes outs really fast! (They need too, cuz they have to get people in and out of there)!\n\n\nRatings (Out of Five Stars)\n\nFood          4.75\nAmbience  4\nService      4.5"

S'I was hoping Monta would be a good replacement for my normal hangover pho craving but it was not. I think it was little overrated.\n\nParking lot is pretty big. Service was good. The restaurant itself is super duper small. Like 5 tables and a bar area. \n\nSpicy Tonkotsu - $7.95 - Basicly the same thing as the tonkotsu but with a spoon full of a chili paste. I do not think that spoon full is worth the extra dollar they charge. The broth was clean and the spice was decent. Not to salty. I like the noodles. Had good bite. The chashu was over cooked, fell apart in the broth. I had to dig around for it.\n\nMiso - $6.95 - Clean broth with good miso flavor. It was super salty. I did not like the noodles in this ramen. The texture reminded me of the dry bagged ramen. \n \nCorn - $.50 - Plain sweet corn. I like corn in my ramen. Good price.\n\nSeasoned Egg - $1.50 - Basicly an egg seasoned with soy sauce. The yolk was good. Not worth the price though. \n\nBIG ISSUE. There was a hair in one of our ramens.GROSSS!!! Usually when there is a hair in your food, they replace it and do not charge you for it but they still charged us. That was a little annoying.\n\nOverall, decent ramen mixed with bad gross luck. Still perfer pho.'

S"Ramen seems like it would be a simple delicacy to create, but this place makes it such an exquisite dish and it is quite delightful to the taste buds. \n\nI noticed a lot of bad reviews are due to the size and service of the restaurant as opposed to the food. But everytime I've came here I have never had that problem. \n\nFirst of all, if you know this place is going to be small I wouldn't suggest bringing large groups. Everytime I've been here was with only one other person when I've had a craving for good ramen and some Japanese beer. With that said I've always been able to get a seat without having to wait too long and my food has always come out speedy, fresh, and fantastic. \n\nThe tonkatsu-shoyu ramen is awesome and if you'd rather opt out of the mixed broth they are both good stand alone too. There are a lot of toppings you can add to your soup which is pretty awesome also. \n\nGreat place for anyone to check out, but just remember the size capacity issue when trying out this place!"

S"Whenever I wanted to eat ramen in Las Vegas the best option was to stay home and cook a bag of Maruchan. Why is that you ask? Because at least then I'm already prepared to be disappointed. The ramen scene in Vegas is not that great, there are few choices of where to go and even fewer options of what type to order.\n\nHearing from my friends that we were planning to visit a new ramen place I got quite excited. Were we finally going to find a place worth eating ramen at after all these years? The simple answer, yes.\n\nAs soon as I walked into Monta I knew that this was going to be a place we would eat again. The decor was simplistic in nature and at the same time very enchanting. There were few seats, maybe 26 at most, but you didn't feel cramped at all. We chose to sit at the bar seating and got a great view of the chefs at work.\n\nA first look at the menu told me that there were three different types of ramen to choose from. This may not seem like a lot but accompanying that was a decent sized list of sides that you can add for a small price. As my nickname is Miso, I decided to stay true to it and order the miso ramen. I requested no bamboo shoots or mushrooms, that come with the order at no extra cost along with some slices of pork. I also decided to add an egg to my order because egg in my opinion makes everything better.\n\nThe staff there was very upbeat and happily took our orders. They were very chatty with each other, but not in a bad way. This is the kind of staff that you know they enjoy their work. If anyone needed a refill on their drink the staff was very quick to notice and refill them without any trouble.\n\nAs the food arrived all of us looked at our food putting off the first bite in fear of being disappointed once again by another bowl of ramen, boy were we wrong. The first bite was amazing and with that we began to devour our dinner with gusto. The flavor of the miso was a little on the salty side but not so much to over power it. The noodles were prepared well and the texture was enjoyable. The egg that I had ordered did not disappoint, and the pork was a pleasure to eat. The size of the order was enough to make me content. Had I wanted more there was an option for more noodles for $2.00, which is not that bad at all.\n\nOverall the experience at Monta was a great one. It may not be the best ramen out there, but it is for sure the best ramen you are going to find here in Vegas. The pricing is reasonable, the order came out to under $10.00, and the food did not disappoint. If you are looking for some good ramen, Monta is the place to go in town!

S"A nice little hole-in-the wall near Chinatown.  They serve really good ramen here.  I was a little doubtful when I first came, but this place is legit!\n\nThey have four different broths (Tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and tonkotsu-shoyu)  I've tried three of the four, but I have to say that the tonkotsu is my favorite!\n\nThere's definitely a pork flavor, rich and soothing.  The soup is steaming when it comes out, but it makes it taste even better!  The pork they have is a little thinner than I would've preferred (due to the fragility when picking the meat up with chopsticks) but it's still so delicious.  I had my tonkotsu with the garlic mash that they have and a soft-boiled egg.  Perfect for a winter day!  The soup is great by itself, but every new topping that is added just gives more depth.\n\nI found that the broth gets saltier the longer it sits.  =(  It kind of sucks because by the time I finish the noodles, the broth is too salty for me to drink.  Can't wait to go back!"

The ramen varieties were limited to only 4: Shio, Shoyu, Tonkatsu, and Tonkatsu Shoyu.  I've been spoiled by Ramen Parlor with variety.  Definitely worth checking out if you have a ramen craving and in try Las Vegas surrounding area."

When I bit into the meal I was a little disappointed because it wasn't what I expected it to be.  The bacon waffles was something different, I liked that part.  The chicken on the other hand I wasn't too much of a fan, the breading was a little off to me and the sauce that was on the plate did not go well with the meal, it tasted like soy sauce.  I'd rate it a 3 but I gave it a 4 because you definitely get what you pay for!

The portions are huge, go hungry or be prepared to share.  If you do share, order a side because you'll be charged a plate splitting fee - this was suggested by our server - if I remember correctly, the splitting fee cost more than ordering a side.  He was one of the best servers I have experienced.  People are not kidding when they say the portions are huge.  I saw the pork tenderloin being served to someone, it seriously looked like the size of my head.\n\nWe went with the chicken and waffles with a side of bacon.  I guess we totally missed reading the description because inside the waffles there are whole slices of bacon!  The chicken was fried perfectly, but the maple sauce was just too sweet for my taste with the chicken, it's nice with the waffle though.

I usually have no trouble knocking off "large" plates, but this one was definitely a challenge... The steak I had was a good 24 oz. and all the side dishes were enough to feed the starving children in Africa, and then some. I saw so many people sitting around our table, just in awe of the portions that were being served at their (and others\') tables... Aside from the huge portions, the variety of dishes here were surprisingly nice. They even offer breakfast dishes during dinner hours, so that\'s a plus for anyone that craves pancakes at 10pm... Beware of the pancakes though... they are about the size of a pizza, and enough to definitely make the hungriest of people full. So, if you enjoy large portions, and a challenge... or an opportunity to impress your friends by finishing off a freakin\' cow-sized steak.... this is the place! The service was also quite nice here the few times I\'ve eaten here... and parking has been no trouble as well...

I love it!  \nWe did not have to wait for seating although this place was full of people.  The portions are HUGE.  This is not an exaggeration.  The service we received was rather slow, but maybe because they are very busy, however, our waiter seemed to ignore us.  I had the French Toast, which I never order for breakfast anywhere, but the description, "griddled french toast dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup", made me want to order it.  How could I resist anything dipped in banana cinnamon cream?  My taste buds had such high expectation, but sadly, they were let down.  Where was the creamy taste of banana cinnamon cream?  The french toast was fine, but truly nothing exceptional - in fact, it tasted just like the french toast I\'ve made for myself at home, which is not saying much.  However, if you are in Vegas, I still suggest you visit, especially if big portions are calling your name.  Just order something other than the french toast, in fact, if I ever go back there, I think I would check the place out for lunch or dinner because I\'ve discovered at other eateries that I\'ve visited, that a place can have awesome food, but breakfast tends to be a weak link.  Or maybe I would return because it\'s just my wishfull thinking that a place with such a cool name surely has to deliver.'

S'If you are looking for a great place and want to get off the strip for a bit this is a fun place to take the family.  It is great for larger parties and kids. The staff was very friendly and accommodated our group of 8 with 4 of those being kids.  \nThe portions are crazy big, but as some places with huge portions they like on quality, this is not the case there.  The quantity and quality are both done well.  I was able to order one dish and share with my 2 kids and there was plenty to go around.  \nThis is not a place to hit up if you are looking for a light meal, but more a splurge to indulge while on vacation.'

S"Granted the timing of my visit could not have been more ideal - the day after running a marathon (read: Monday) at 8am.  No line, super service, and enough awesome food to replenish the previous day's ridiculous caloric expenditure.\n\nWe had specialty drinks all around, including the Oreo mocha (so good my non-coffee fan husband sucked the whole thing down), banana latte (delish!), and a blueberry lemonade that my dad loved.\n\nThe food portions are epic.  The selections are creative and oh-so-tasty that it'll kill you to not be able to finish.  Most of the breakfast items strike me as superb hangover/post mass alcohol consumption delights (fitting for any LV breakfast haunt), but are still well-suited for a non-inebriated experience as well.\n\nThe scramble with the salmon and brie was amazing.  The crispy potatoes are quite good, but the griddled mash puts up a darn good fight.  The chicken and waffles are more of a visual novelty, but are still pretty good.  They had an awesome special scramble that included a delicious lump crab cake on top - total yum!"

S'Hands down, it\'s a 5 star.  Didn\'t need to think about it.  It\'s always packed and there is a reason for that.  My husband and I go here for Breakfast only...never been for lunch or dinner so can\'t speak to anything but the breakfast...which is the BOMB! \nPortions are enormous.   I usually get the same thing every time \'cuz it\'s so darn good.  I get the omelet or I think they refer to it as a "scramble"  but it has eggs, feta cheese and sun-dried tomatoes.  Never had a breakfast that was better than this place.   I am always surprised when I am looking around and I see people ordering cocktails at 10 am but it definitely is happening at the Hash House.   One weird thing is I don\'t think they bring butter with those huge fluffy biscuits.   No big deal for me as I usually save the biscuit for last and then am too full to eat it.  It\'s kinda on the pricey side but it is so good that it\'s worth it.   If you get a chance to order the au-gratin potatoes instead of fries, DO IT.

In fact, if you have a moment can you please update the Wiki, the pictures there are boring and this menu is truly exciting and imaginative. \n\nThe biscuits and gravy are a must. Wow I loved these.

So unless you are a very big eater (or a sumo wrestler in training) share a plate or make sure you have some place to put the leftovers.\n\nThis place is located in Imperial Palace which in itself is a pretty fun kitchy kind of joint.  You have to take the escalator behind the bar up to get to it and you will wait no matter what time of day or night you go.  The servers are nice and very fast and they have to be fast.  This place is always packing.  We went for lunch but we did see some breakfast items go past us.\n\nPancake I swear was size of hubcap; chicken and waffles had to be about a foot high on the plate.  Hubby had the BBBLT sandwich which had almost half a head of lettuce, almost a whole tomato, about 8 slices of bacon, and milk bread that was about 2 inches thick. It came with a steak knife stabbed in the middle holding it together.  I had the cob salad platter - errrrr I mean plate.  Big chunks of everything in it including a whole avocado and a biscuit about the size of a softball.\n\nA lot of people were gawking at other tables food orders cause they were all huge.  One guy at a table behind us just stared at his plate for awhile before he figured out how to attack it.  The prices aren't too bad, but you get food enough and then some for what you pay.  \n\nCome hungry - leave happy and waddling off.  Good times!!!"

After suffering through a miserable meal -- bad service, bad food, bad attitudes --  at the now-closed location at the M Resort, I said I would never go back.  But while in Reno,, staying at Harrah's Reno, I unhappily noticed that the hotel has almost no other choices, so I tried the Hash House there.  Yuck!

S'Having heard about Hash House A Go Go from the show "Man vs Food" we gave it a try on our last trip to Vegas.  We went to the branch that just recently opened in the Imperial Palace rather than the original one on Sahara Blvd.\n\nThey call it "Twisted Farm Food."  I call it "Mutant Meals."  Everything is so out of proportion that you would swear it was injected with steroids.  My son ordered the fried chicken and waffle combo.  My wife and I had the Banana-Cinnamon waffle with grilled mash potatoes (our ten year old daughter opted for a bowl of Frosted Flakes--oh well). We really enjoyed our fare.  The pancake was outstanding and the grilled mashed very good.  Needless to say, we couldn\'t finish it (just barely half).  My son ate most of his chicken and waffle duo but said the chicken was dry.\n\nThe service is very friendly but not very swift (they make everything to order and it is quite likely that the size of the portions restricts what they can cook at one time.)  We liked the atmosphere and would definitely go back.\n\nEnjoy but don\'t expect any diet plates.  In summary, when in Vegas, I i recommend that you "go go" to this place.'

Lady I sat next to on the plane, a local, told me I had to go while in town.  Glad I did!

S'The Hash House A Go Go has an interesting menu and has been on a travel channel show, but in my opinion, it is more fluff than substance and your typical example of "sounds better on paper."  You get large portions at a premium price for your typical diner (aka Denny\'s style) food dressed up with a sprig of sage - it\'s not bad but you might feel a bit disappointed if you were expecting something awesome.  Stay away from some of the gimmicky items, and you will have an experience similar to an IHOP.\n\nAs a person who usually orders waffles, I have to say this: order the pancakes.  The waffles have a slight baking soda taste, and when you get the bacon cooked in the waffle, it makes the flavor more pronounced.  Most people are too hung-over or impressed by the serving size to care.  It took me 2 visits to come to the conclusion that decent pancakes trump weird waffles, and trust me, you don\'t want to order the bacon waffle unless you really like grease.  Despite the yummy sounding menu, the best items to get are their "regular" dishes like an omelet or eggs and bacon.  Their food tends to be bland, as if adding salt or ketchup is a requirement.  The chicken is ok for the first couple of bites, but it\'s actually a bit too dry and bland to enjoy without dipping it in something.  The omelets and pancakes were never bad during my visits.\n\nThe service is efficient and professional, though not particularly friendly.  If this place is on your "Vegas to do List" then you should try to come during non-peak meal hours to avoid lines and a busy waitress.  \n\nI know The Hash House A Go Go tries to create a nice breakfast/diner experience but the inconsistent flavors makes it difficult to really like.  If you\'re here to experience Vegas, then stick with some basic breakfast or menu items and you should be fine.  It\'s not a bad place, but I think it is more hype than taste.  There are cheaper and tastier places to have breakfast, but then again, Hash A Go Go does provide some very interesting menu options.  You should go just to see how big some of these dishes are.'

I was looking all over for just your traditional bacon and eggs and hash browns and that was $13-14.  Finally found it and the hash browns are country potatoes that were hard and cold.  They make their own jam, sort of.  It was a gelled mess of a real strawberry.  I saw other people get waffles or pancakes that are huge but you only get one as a serving.

A group of us came here to try this place cause we heard great things about it. It was pack on Saturday and we waited for about 45 Min's and we were starving so we couldn't wait to eat. The drinks are good My OJ was fresh u can taste that they just made it and my cousin had the watermelon kiwi it was sweet but good. \n\nThe food took about 25 Min's but they tell u that on the menu because they cook everything fresh so a Lil wait won't hurt. I got the MVF special which is the Andy sage chicken and omg that bad boy was da bomb. I thought the chipotle sauce may ruined it but no it made it better and the griddle mash on the bottom so freaking delicious they kept picking at it. It is a big portion but if u love to eat then get it. My cousin got the Chicken and waffles and since I live in L.A we have Roscoe's and they known for the waffles and chicken. My cousin said wtf is that bacon inside my waffle F***ing hell ya. The plate looks like a freaking sky scrapper when it comes out he said it was the best chicken and waffles he ever had but I still like Roscoe's but the best fried chicken is at HHGG IMO. \n\nMy cousin In law got the tractor farm with the banana Cinnamon french toast and holy cow that toast had to be 3 inches thick it was ridiculously but I had a bite and it sent me to the moon it was that good. Overall we paid 63 bucks for 3 people which is cheaper then the buffet and I was the only one to finish my meal.

The wait time was about 20 minutes, which I did not mind and was expecting anyway, seeing how crowded the restaurant was. The waiting area was pretty small, but it was fun looking at the autographed pictures of celebrities that they had on their wall, such as Penn and Teller, Ne-Yo, and Neil Patrick Harris. \n\nMelissa was our server. She was alright, but not the greatest. It took a while for her to greet us and take our orders, but I understand that they were extremely busy. After we got our food, she did check up on us twice, but did not refill our drinks once. The thing that annoyed me was that she seemed extra friendly to the party who sat in back of us. I heard her asking them if this was their first time at the restaurant, and they responded that it was. She gave them a friendly welcome and explained the menu to them. That's funny, it was our first visit here as well and she never bothered to ask us that!\n\nMy husband and I decided to share the chicken and waffles. We also ordered two sides - bacon and the biscuits and gravy to avoid the $2.50 split plate charge. \nJust an FYI: yes, they charge $2.50 if you are splitting plates, but you can avoid it if you order a side dish.\nI have to say, the presentation of our food and everyone else's around us was nice and pretty! But, I wasn't impressed. The chicken was dry, and even though the waffles looked awesome because they had strips of bacon cooked into them, it didn't taste that great. Our order got screwed up as well. Apparently our biscuits and gravy = a side of sausage. \n\nI'm willing to give Hash House A Go Go another try in the future. Maybe we just ordered the wrong dish.

Not too bad at all!! \n\nWe were helped by Nick!! He was awesome!! I could tell that he was very busy with many other tables but he was still positive, cheerful, upbeat and attentive to our table. \n\nWe ordered 2 Andy Sage Fried Chicken ($13.50/each) a Tractor Driver Combo ($13.50) with scrambled eggs, bacon, crispy potatoes and ($1 upgrade for a Hash House famous flapjack) a Brown Sugar Banana Flapjack and another Tractor Driver Combo ($13.50) with scrambled eggs, sausage and ($1 upgrade for a Hash House famous flapjack) an Apple Cinnamon Flapjack. For drinks we ordered 3 Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade ($5.50 each) and a Banana Latte ($5.99).\n\nMy Andy Sage Fried Chicken was AMAZING!!!!!! The portions here are huge and I was able to each this for\nmultiple meals :D It is served with a layer of mashed potatoes on the bottom, then two biscuits, tomatoes, bacon, the huge fried chicken, 2 scrambled eggs on top. And all of that loveliness and covered in their tasty special sauce. I highly recommend this item!! I think Man vs Food even featured this item of one of their episodes!!! \n\nMy friends really enjoyed their Tractor Driver Combos but it was too HUGE!! They were only able to stuff down half  of their order, but the flapjacks aren't ideal to togo. I would recommend sharing this item if you order it :) \n\nYou can't come here without trying their award winning Kiwi Watermelon Lemonade!!!!!!! It is refreshing, well balanced AND pretty for the camera.

I really do.  \nBut other than the fact that they have ginormo portions, the food is just ok.  The chicken and waffles are good.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good.

S'Okay, so I guess I should start by saying that we came for breakfast, first time trying their breakfast menu. They had tons of yummy sounding options, but I settled on a blueberry pecan pancake, over medium eggs, and bacon. My boyfriend got the french toast.\n\nHis french toast sounded soo good on the menu description, and when it was served, it looked fantastic, except for the griddled bananas (served in the peel, which was black and mushy, tasted good but very unappealing looking) his french toast tasted like nothing, and was mushy and in general, just kind of blah.\n\nMy pancake was HUGE, and yummy, but my over medium eggs were basically raw, I mean the yolks were super runny (which is fine, I never, ever send food back) I was going to eat them until I noticed that the whites werent even cooked, I mean, runny whites on an over medium egg? Yuck! I asked the waitress for new ones and she obliged saying, "oh sure, you might want more of an over medium." Um, yeah cause that\'s what I ordered. She brings the eggs back out and clearly the cook was annoyed that they got sent back, because he cooked the crap out of these eggs, I mean, they were beyond well done. Whatever, I mean the pancake was so huge I didn\'t even need the eggs at that point.\n\nFast forward to them picking up the bill, I was paying by credit, they took the card, and then a different person came back and asked for Id, which I accidentally left at home. (If its your policy to get Id for credit cards, that\'s fine, but maybe ask for the identification before you run the card?) I explained I didn\'t have it and instead of offering another option he glared at me and asked if it was really my card. I mean, come on. I said that yes it is my card and he just mumbled something under his breath and walked off! We had cash, and would have paid in cash! To top it off we had to wait another few minutes for them to bring me a pen so I could sign the receipt.  Really? I wanted to love this place, again the menu for breakfast is really enticing. But our general experience was way off.\n\nAll in all, I\'ve eaten here a few times (other times for dinner) and in general, they definitely wow you with portion sizes but they lack actual flavor. They describe their food as midwestern farm food with a twist. After eating here a handful of times I\'m convinced the twist is the portion size and the giant sprig of rosemary they serve with everything.'

I had my 94 year old grandmother with me as well as 2 children and they would not give her a childs meal.  One of the kids ordered off of the adult menu too.

Well, it's a vegas experience I am not incline to have too often. \n\nOk, so it's a bit of waiting on weekend noontime.  We had to walk around to kill time but ended up came back really too late.  However there wasn't too many people waiting and we were able to get the table quickly."

S'Midwest size portions meets Las Vegas excess.  Or maybe brunch on steroids?  This place came highly recommended and it did not disappoint.  Located away from the hordes of the visitors milling about the strip, this place is so popular that there is usually a 45 minute to 60 minute wait just to get seated.   Thankfully there were several of us so many dishes were sampled.  I ended up with the chicken and waffles which were excellent.   The chicken was perfectly fried up, not soggy or greasy.  The waffles were stuffed with bacon of all things!  Genius!  I also got to sample the hand hammered pork cutlet covered in some type of sage cream gravy which was pretty fantastic.  The portions are ludicrous.  I felt like we were in an episode of the Flintstones.  Huge portions and reasonable prices.  Most entrees ran about $15 but the quality and portion size made it pretty reasonable.  Not to mention that most buffets on the strip are much pricier with hit or miss quality.  Seriously, those of you with normal sized appetites might consider splitting some of the larger entrees they are so huge.'

It was very tasty and it was my 1st exp. with chicken and waffles which i missed out on when I was in LA b/c i stood for 3 hrs in line for Pink's. argh. Anyway everything on the menu sounded so good. i havent been back b/c i'm trying to trim down and let's face it going to hash house is kinda counterproductive to that goal! but oh so good!. \nOne thing i thought was the strangest thing. they have the smallest shortest water glasses I've ever seen, but they consistently came by to refill them so it was ok.

A tower topped by a sprig of local rosemary, it had something different with every bite.  Ham, fresh spinach, smoked bacon, grilled mozzarella, scrambled eggs, mashed potatoes...all covered in chipotle cream.  Only the unripe hothouse tomato disappointed.\n\nService was unattentive, slow and hairy.  The waiter's beard was long enough that it probably should have been in a hair net.

S'Huge portions? How about delusions of grander; delusions that the food is unique and good for starters. This place is a con job from beginning to end. They serve the food in over sized plates and stack the meat on top of the French toast and people seem to think they are getting something worthwhile. Its beyond lame. My friend ordered a "sirloin" and when it arrived it was about 1/4 cup of meat and the rest cheese and undercooked potatoes. The pancakes were tough and the wait was insane. $46.00 for breakfast food, long waits and a broken bathroom. Sticking a twig of rosemary on the food does not make it gourmet, just goofy. Maybe if you have never had really good "farm" food, you will enjoy. Otherwise, do NOT believe the hype. Its bizzaro world in this place.'

However, I was not a fan of its burger. The patties were dry and overcooked. Yes, it was huge, but no, it was not as tasty as it looked. It did not come with fries and to add a side of happy meal portion fries, we had to pay 2.99 more. Plus, our waiter spilled 1/3 of the fries on the table by accident and he just walked away.

S"Definitely a place to go if you are uber hungry, and with quantity ALSO comes quality at this establishment.  I have gone to the Hash House in San Diego many times, mostly for breakfast and once for lunch, but I gotta say although this one is so distant, it still has the same standard of quality.  It may SEEM pricy, but for the portions you get (enough for maybe 1-2 other meals), it's worth it.\n\nFor Dinner our first night on a week long road-trip, we stopped by Vegas to try this place out.  I had the Boston Hash- the crab cakes were pretty tasty- the only other kind I have to compare it to is the one from Rainforest Cafe (EWWWW!!) and Fisherman's wharf in San Francisco (specifically Sabella and Torre- deLish!)  But the breakfast that takes the cake here is the Crispy Hand hammered pork tenderloin benedict.  The pork is just bursting with flavor and the creamy benedict sauce really complements it really well :)  \n\nI requested Jam for the huge biscuits that usually come with the entrees, and although they don't have any in the evening, the server was able to find some that was saved from the morning (Thank you!!).  It was strawberry preserves, and although it was really good, the BEST is the fresh fruit one made with blueberry/strawberry/peaches.  I commend them for their excellent service, and hope they perhaps open one in Nor Cal ;)"

S'Twisted Farm Food....that\'s pretty accurate\n\nMy only regret is I am not actually a cow, with the four compartment stomach and the ability to ingest 2.5% of my own body weight, which for me would be 4.2 pounds. If you do the math, you can figure out how much I weigh!\n\nI couldn\'t finish my brunch here.  I was defeated by a loaf of meat and mashed potatoes.  I\'m actually somewhat glad I didn\'t attempt the chicken and waffles, because my wife did, and she ate exactly half, so we decided the next time we come here, we would just split one, that way we can both feel accomplished in our eating endeavors.\n\nGargantuan proportions...Just look at those pictures!  The food doesn\'t come on plates; here, they come on PLATTERS.  Seriously consider whether you should donate a portion of your meal to charity.\n\nSage fried chicken and bacon waffle tower.  It wasn\'t that architecturally sound, but at least it looked and tasted great.  Bacon baked into the waffles, 2 pieces of crispy and NOT greasy chicken breasts on top of the waffles, with delicate fried leeks strewn about the plate, and a giant sprig of rosemary holding it all together.  Usually comes drizzled with syrup, but we asked for it on the side and they were happy to do that. \n\nHH meatloaf with mashed potatoes.  Pretty much like normal meatloaf, but crispier and meatier(not meteor).  You know how meatloaf usually comes with either gravy or ketchup on top?  Hash house does it with BBQ sauce!  They are seriously changing the meatloaf game...The dish also came with the biggest biscuit I have ever seen in my life.  It was about 4 and a half fingerbreadths tall and about 7 inches around, and perfectly "biscuit-y".  You know what I mean?  A good balance of flakiness with fluffiness cut with a pinch of butteriness and saltiness, all in equal proportions.  I kind of love biscuits.\n\nI had a bloody mary to accompany my mini smorgasborg of a healthy brunch.  It was well made, as far as bloody marys go, and came with a garnish of a petite dill pickle and 2 jalapeno stuffed olives.\n\nProps - Great food, tip-top service, good bloody mary\n\nNegative props - SERIOUS FOOD COMA.\n\nWe\'d planned to partake in all manner of adventure after brunch, but Hash House decided to ruin our plans by knocking us out with the force of a cast iron pan a la Tom & Jerry for about 4 hours.  We woke up and the sun was gone.  Does that properly demonstrate the power of Hash House a Go Go?'

S'So, consider this My Big Fat First Official Las Vegas Yelp Review since moving here to Sin City.  My partner, Bear, strongly recommended this place after having lunch here with his cousin, who\'s a \'local\'.  And I can see why...HHAGG takes their "twisted farm-fresh" sensibility really seriously, all the way down to the rust-covered "Green Acres"-era tractor perched out front near the parking lot. \n\nBut all else you could notice about the place - even the Wall of Fame at the entrance, that contains the autographed photos of dozens of celebrity past-diners - falls away once the food takes front-and-center stage.  It is no surprise that MAN VS. FOOD\'s Adam Richman considers this one of his all-time favorite places to eat.  The portions are HUGE.  And I mean so big, even ravenous farmhands just in from a full day in the fields might have to step off a bit. \n\nOur friendly, animated waiter warned us away from having individual side orders of fries with our sandwiches, having us opt instead to share just one order between us. WISE call.  The Stuffed One-Pound Burger that I had (with the incredible applewood- smoked bacon and melted cheddar), was cooked to perfection, but more like a TWO-pounder than just a single.  And I was HUNGRY.  If you are gorge-a-phobic, I would strongly suggest that you bring a friend, order one entree and split it.  Uhh, actually, you might even want to make it a couple of friends....\n\nThe amazing thing here, though, is that the food doesn\'t sacrifice the quality for the quantity, which is nothing short of amazing. I do plan on coming back and trying more of the scrumptious-looking items on the menu...just probably not until Thanksgiving!'

Probably the best corned beef I\'ve ever had.  I was going to order that for myself, but my BF was like, "why don\'t you share this with me and order something else so we can try something different?"  Umm okay, what do you want me to order?  I ordered another scramble dish with chorizo in it.  So  yeah, my second attempt?  FAIL!!!  That dish was equally disgusting.  At least I have my BF\'s corned beef to share right?  WRONG!

(If you're coming here, try not to eat for the day because the servings are monstrous!)\n\nI have been to both this location as well as the one in Imperial Palace and would definitely recommend this one by far. (Imperial Palace had equally good food, but MUCH lower quality service). The decor is a bit different for both locations, with the Sahara location being much bigger, livelier, and more attentive service. \n\nAs soon as we got there, we ordered. My boyfriend got the Sage Fried Chicken Benedict and I got the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles....sorry, my mouth started watering just thinking about it.... The wait for our food was unbearable, mostly because waiters were walking by with pancake platters  with pancakes that took up the entire plate (about a foot in diameter)! I ordered a mimosa to ease my nerve. It was okay - too much champagne. \n\nFinally, our food came. Two plates of enormous proportions - my chicken and waffles were the size of my head! It looked really good, though: four bacon waffles, topped with perfectly fried chicken topped with a not-too-sweet maple glaze. (They had to drive a steak knife through it to make sure it didn't topple over). The chicken was tender, but fried in a bit of a spicy batter, which paired with the sweetness of the glaze, waffle, and bacon really well. \n\nLooking at his benedict, though, I had to take a sliver....which turned into half of his plate, haha. It was amazing! A perfect biscuit, topped with sage fried chicken, two eggs, bacon mashed potatoes, and hollandaise sauce. (Oh, and a slice of fruit to be healthy). The flavors came together so well! \n\nWe ate so much, our stomachs looked like two balloons ready to burst. It was worth it, though. It's been a week, and I'm having withdrawals. \n\nIf you're looking for a GOOD meal or want to be filled for days, or both, then go to Hash House - you won't regret it."

Omelettes are ultra tasty and so are the potatoes! Mmm. Orange juice does taste really fresh. Sure exceeded my expectations here. I definitely want to try out their signature watermelon kiwi lemonade next time. It looked SO good when someone else ordered it. Definitely will come back very soon!'

I could not finish a whole order of Biscuits and Gravy...  possibly made a mistake ordering french fries on top of potatoes that came with my oder - but our server said we did a "great" job and came closer than most to finishing our dishes.\n\nMy friend had a burger with hardwood smoked bacon, avocado and cheddar cheese.. the burger was huge and yummy looking...I snuck a bite....\n\nNobody left the Hash House hungry...in fact, just as some of the reviews have said, we needed a nap after.... the food was a fun take on breakfast classics and the service was down home friendly...and the atmosphere was pleasant and the decor was Midwest modern and relaxing for the middle of the desert.'

My man ordered a steak sandwich. It was so big, it came to the table with a steak knife through it, instead of a toothpick. We had a great time laughing at ourselves for attempting to eat the over-sized food. \n\nThe portions may have been enormous, but the prices were surprisingly moderate.

S"I live in Huntington Beach, CA. and vacation in Vegas when possible. My last trip to Vegas I had the extreme pleasure of eating breakfast at this fine establishment. I have to say in my honest opinion i haven't had a breakfast that has ever or will ever compare to it again. I ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffles. Huge Portion, enough to fill me up till dinner time! Bacon was cooked finely into the waffles which had carmelized or crystalized maple syrup on top of them, I thought how weird but good lord it was like a symphony of dankness on my palet. The fried chicken was very freshly cooked and on the plate there was a sauce for the chicken of the likes of which i cannot compare with any other. These combinations made for a breakfast I to this day wish i could enjoy over here in California. I heard there is one in San Diego but am unsure if its the same company or not. People rave about Roscoes Chicken and Waffles down here, which i have not had, but given the quality of this food and the way it was prepared i cant imagine that any other breakfast joint has anything on Hash House A Go Go. This is a must people. Manditory for any tourist or local to dine at. Very Original, Very Clean, Very well done! Thnx Hash House!"

S'We took a cab from the airport to "Hash House a Go Go".  The cab ride was a bit pricey because the restaurant was far from the airport but a friend wanted to try this place so we gave it a Go Go... Hehe ok that wasn\'t funny.  It probably sounded more funny when I was typing it out.\n\nWe came to Hash House at about 11:00AM on a Saturday and had to wait for about 30 minutes.  The place was busy and did not take reservations on weekends.  I\'m not sure if they take it on weekdays.\n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles.  The portions were huge and the chicken was decent.  The dish included four waffles, each with a strip of bacon inside the waffle.  When my dish came out, I looked at it and said, "Hell no I\'m eating this thing..." but to my surprise, it was actually pretty good.  I never thought  fried chicken, bacon, waffles, and syrup would taste good together.  Service is average so expect to wait a little.\n\nAll in all, a good place to have breakfast.  One portion is more than enough for two people.  The price is really good at about 13 bucks for the chicken and waffle, which could feed a family of four without a big appetite.  I finished all of my chicken but only ate one of the waffles.  I did pick out all of the bacon from the other three pieces of waffle though.'

S'When visiting my parents In Las Vegas, my husband likes to try all the different buffets.  This weekend I wanted to try something different, and I\'m glad we did.  Their slogan "Twisted Farm Food" encapsulates the menu pretty well.\n\nWe went to HH for breakfast around 10:30 on Sunday morning and sat down immediately.  Lucky timing -- because when we left about an hour later the line was huge.  Much like the huge portions of food we were served.  My husband had one of the Sunday Specials -- a giant skillet with pork tenderloin, home fried potatoes, green beans, corn, sun dried tomatoes, mozzarella, 2 fried eggs and a huge biscuit.  I had a scramble that consisted of salmon, pesto and brie that was also served with home fries and huge biscuit.  We switched plates half way through and still brought home a (you guessed it) HUGE box of leftovers.\n\nMy husband liked the very strong coffee that was refilled often.  I liked the homemade blackberry jam atop the biscuits.  The food was good, but needed a bit more salt then we\'re used to adding.  The service was top notch, especially considering how busy the place was the entire time.  And the music was all 80s alternative which made my meal that much more enjoyable :)'

They have always strived to make the dining experience shine. Their knowledge of their products and their friendly yet professional demeanor are very high pluses. Edmund, our waiter, was great at explaining everything and keeping us happy.\n\nOkay- the dinner menu isn't the shining star of the restaurant.

HUMONGOUS. \n\nDespite the portion size, I set out to conquer my cheeseburger. Half way in, it was clear that the burger would win the battle, as I began gasping for air and drinking water to clear my stomach for more. All futile attempts at this point.\n\nService was ok. Our waitress was awol for several minutes, it was difficult to get her attention as she appeared overwhelmed by the amount of customers in her care at that moment. \n\nPrices are quite reasonable for the amount of food.

S'Overrated. \n\nMy boyfriend and I were so excited to go here because of the great reviews they had. Sorry to say that I do not feel like the reviews lived up to my expectations.\n\nThe line was extremely long and we waited a good 20 minutes for a table. Not a problem at all. We weren\'t in any rush. We were seated and the waiter came about 5 minutes after which was also fine. It gave us time to look over the menu which I wasn\'t impressed with. The menu was large, didn\'t offer anything to me that appealed to me. I ordered a vegetarian option since everything had with meat included pork which I do not eat. I must say, it would be nice to have turkey sausage or turkey bacon on the menu for those of us who doesn\'t eat pork. However, having a vegetarian breakfast wasn\'t a problem. \n\nI order an egg scrambled with veggies and cheese added. It came with fresh fruit, potatoes and a humongous biscuit. This biscuit was bigger than my palm! Sadly, that was the highlight of the meal. The potatoes had no flavor and were kinda cold. You can tell that they were cooked in large quantity earlier in the day and served out of pot. The fruit was sweet so I didn\'t have any issue. My eggs and veggies again lacked flavor. I had to add a nice amount of salt and pepper to give it some kinda "umph". The food was just OK. \n\nI was very disappointed with the food considering all of the hype including chefs like Rachel Ray. I have experienced MUCH better brunch/breakfast food.'

The burger had no flavor to it at all. The fried chicken on my waffles were also flavorless. The waffles were a bit dry too.\n\nWe had a table of people across from us walk out after complaining to the waiter about how bad the food was.

S'"Hello, stomach? Did you mention that you were hungry? Oh, you did...? Alright, you asked for it.  Get ready to stretch those muscles because we\'re gonna test your endurance today..."\n\nLike many of my fellow Yelpers, I ventured towards Hash House a Go Go after seeing a Man v. Food episode.  This place does not disappoint!  3 people + 2 meals = full stomachs AND leftovers!!  \n\nWe came in at 8:30 on a Friday morning .  We were promptly seated and attended to.  The menu is extensive, but we finally settled on two dishes and ordered.  We mentioned to the waitress that we had a tight schedule (a 10:00 spa appointment... I know, you\'re jealous...), and she noted that the service was quick!  \n\nFood came to the table and all of our eyes went big.  Yowzah.  \n\nCorned Beef House Hash - Corned Beef, red onions and swiss cheese tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit :: The corned beef itself was just okay; I appreciated that they used strips of real corned beef, but the flavor and texture didn\'t really wow me.  On its own, nothing special, but combined with the other items on the dish and it was a winner.  The potatoes were perfectly cooked, and the biscuit was flaky and moist.  There was fresh jam on the table (score!); the flavor of the day was peach-mango.  Peach-mango jam on a biscuit... mmm... YUM.  \n\nThe Tractor Driver Combo -  Two Eggs w/ bacon, sausage or potatoes with griddled french toast, which is dipped in banana cinnamon cream and served w/ pecan maple syrup :: Texas-style toast, moist and packed with flavor.  The syrup just brings the whole dish over the top!  \n\nThe portions were HUGE.  We all ended up sharing our leftovers for breakfast the next morning and it was still more than enough. I\'m interested in seeing the atmosphere in the evening and trying other dishes.  I already know that I want to try: Andy\'s Sage Fried Chicken w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatoes & biscuit, Flapjacks (flavors include Blueberry Pecan, Blackberry Granola, Snickers, Mango Coconut, Strawberry Frosted Flake, to name a few!), and the Chicken and Waffles.  The service was okay; refills of coffee and water at the ready.  \n\nI\'m sure it\'ll take me quite a few visits - and regular trips to my cardiologist! - to get the full Hash House experience. But, hey, go big or go home, right?!'

S"I came in this morning for the first time and ordered the crabcake hash breakfast plate special. What I received was a lukewarm crab cake that had no flavor, on a bed of what seem like six potatoes chopped up and browned, and a couple of eggs. First of all my son could've made those eggs and potatoes. There was no seasoning on them and nothing to them at all. When I ate the crabcake and got to the middle and found it to be cold, I asked my waiter for help. He was good enough to bring me another plate and that's what I was shocked. There was such a difference between the first place I was served and the second that it really turned me off. The crabcake was hot and even though it tasted basically the same it was freshly cooked. I can't figure out for the life of me why they would serve me that first plate, but I guess since I was by myself and sitting in the bar it wasn't any big deal. I don't have any idea if the other plates of food are better than what I got but I can tell you that I won't be back after this morning's experience."

S"I thought Cheesecake Factory is the only restaurant that serves oversize portions, boy was I wrong! Hash House a Go Go serves gigantic portions with its unique menu items, from Chicken and Waffles to elegant prepared Mahi Mahi with blue crab cake.\n\nHubby and others ordered the special for the night, which was the Chicken and Waffles for $12.95 compared to $18 something on other nights. When it came out, it was taller than me (sitting down, of course). I was very surprised that the chicken were 2 thick pieces of huge breast meat. The chicken was crispy and a little sweet from the glaze. I thought the batter may need a little bit more seasoning but still decent.\n\nI ordered the Mahi Mahi with blue crab cake ($27). The presentation looked like I was at a fancy 5 stars restaurant; it was gorgeous. The taste was different but good enough for me to almost finished the entire entree. The dish started out with a bed of two mounds of mashed potatoes, then layered with with two pieces of Mahi Mahi and then the blue crab cake which was covered with the pesto sauce. It also came with a side of carrots.\n\nOver all the experience was enjoyable because the entree were fun to look at and atmosphere was nice.\n\nThe service was great. We arrived here 30 minutes before closing, and still sat all seven us down with a friendly smile. They didn't rush or anything even though we felt bad."

The chicken was bland and dry, and the leeks on top made the whole dish have an onion taste. The waffles tasted completely like bacon, and there wasn't enough syrup. The entire dish was dry. I also couldn't decide how to tackle it. It was a really tall stack of waffles and chicken. I ordered a child sized pancake for my toddler, and it was the size of a small table. The portions are huge and I feel like its a waste of food. Also, I hated the atmosphere. The music was so loud that I couldn't talk to my family members that I had gone out to breakfast with unless I was yelling, and then they had to yell back. The service was pretty slow too, and not the greatest. Finally, the food that didn't live up to the hype was overpriced. I had been looking forward to trying out Has House A Go Go for quite some time and I was thoroughly disappointed."

If I happened to be in LV again and someone suggested going here, I'd happily say yes, but I'm not going to be dreaming of it or talking reverently about it like some of my friends.\n\nI was very pleased at being able to get a table immediately on a Sunday at lunch time.  The menu, while not huge, had a lot of interesting possibilities (especially if you eat meat and/or eggs).  I decided on the apple cinnamon pancake - that's right, singular.  One pancake was the size of a serving platter.  It did have a good amount of cinnamon, and thin green apple slices cooked in all over it, which I liked better than the pie filling apples you sometimes get on top of apple pancakes.  My friend had the vegetarian hash; I only tried some of the potatoes and tomatoes, it was okay but not stunning.  Service was fine, price was reasonable.

S'The food itself is very good if you enjoy the all american southern type of food. I cannot complain about the food because it was large portions, well made, and very unique in itself. I got the corn beef hash and was barely able to finish it. It gives the complete satisfaction of being full. \nThe service however was absolutely awful. My friends and I came into Las Vegas hoping to visit this place for their breakfast. When we arrived we were seated and ordered from the menu. Right after our food was brought out the checks were brought with them. This is always troubling because when the checks are brought out right away then everyone is concerned about the cost of the meal and not enjoying themselves. It also means we can\'t order anything else if we want to since it\'s already been printed. \nThe next problem was how difficult it is to get water there. I\'m not sure if it\'s a delicacy in the Hash House A Go Go, but the first time we asked the waiter was like "I\'ll get that right away." He then comes out and starts taking orders from other tables. We then give him a second chance and ask again and he replies "sorry, ill get that in a second." He comes out again without any water and is ready to collect the bill. We then beg him to please get water after all our meals are finished and he finally decides to to come out with the response "the long awaited water." When I go to a restaurant I base my tip solely on how quick they are at refilling my water, how pleasant they are, and if they are checking on our table or not. If these are done I\'ll give 20-25% tip. It was hard to give a tip at this place because of how poor the service was.'

Our coffee and water arrived within a couple minutes. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash. I figure that if this is a hash house they should be able to do this right. This was without a doubt the best corned beef hash I've ever eaten.  It came out on a platter. When people say that the portions are generous, that's an understatement. The corned beef was shredded, mixed with swiss cheese and put it over these amazing potatoes. It was served with a real biscuit and eggs. I like my eggs over hard. I hate runny yolks. I've sent eggs back at many a fine establishment. THIS PLACE GOT MY EGGS RIGHT!!!\n\nBF got a pumpkin cranberry waffle. It was huge. Served with butter and whipped cream. Yummy! There was so much food that we ended up switching place, he finished my hash and I finished his waffle.  The next time I go to Vegas, this is going to be a regular stop.

S'When people write of the downfall of America, Hash House A Go Go must be included.  I say that because if we all go here, it will makes us fat, happy and complacent.  I ate there five days ago and I think Im still full.  Giant portions are but a small (Large?) measure of Hash\'s greatness.  \n\nWorking under the moniker "Twisted Farm Food," Hash has the decor of an industrial style barn.  While being seated, you notice every table gawking at other tables in sheer awe of what is being delivered to other tables.  Imagine being at a Hospital nursery and all the babies are 25 lbs, and the fathers are just looking at each other and smiling.  That\'s whats going on here.  \n\nFirst thing I noticed was the prices...they\'re really cheap for the amount of food I saw coming out.  I dont think anything was more than $15.  The waitress explained that the restaurant makes everything from scratch and that there are no heat lamps meaning food can be brought out at different times.  Working under that guise, I contemplated what would I like to try in giant form and made of scratch that Ive probably never had before.  I settled on the Pounded Pork Tenderloin sandwich with crispy french fries.\n\nWhen my sandwich came out, I desperately asked my waitress for tactical help on how to eat it.  The sandwich was so large I had no idea where to begin.  She laughed no doubt having heard that 100\'s of times before.  I finally dove in and found the pork cutlet to be tender and tasty.  Not the absolute best I ever had, but for the price and the portions I felt it was more than acceptable.  The fries were excellent and actually crispy...rare is it when a restaurant advertises crispy these days and actually delivers a crispy product.  My party also really enjoyed their oversized sandwiches of various ilk.  \n\nAs we descended into dreams of wearing elastic pants for our expanded waistlines, we became part of the peanut gallery looking at other peoples tables and what they had ordered.  The burgers are ginormous and the breakfasts really steal the show.  Pancakes the size of pizzas, hash brown servings that must be made of two full potatoes and toast truly of the "Texas" variety.  There are so many things I need to go back and try but these trips must be rationed for health\'s sake.\n\nService was very friendly and accommodating and there was relatively little wait to be seated although I do know on weekends at brunch time you will wait awhile (I see it whenever I drive by).  Another great added benefit was that with my $13 sandwich I was able to get a full 3 meals out of it.  Three!!!   \n\nThis restaurant truly embodies the ethos: "Only in America.....:'

I guess the upside to it was that we got to see what all the other food on the menu looked like.\n\nThey definitely don't kid around when it comes to portions .. they're HUGE!

I don't think I've ever seen this concoction before but it was pretty tasty. We added vodka to ours!\n\n3. Mushroom and artichoke scramble - very plain. It was very simply cooked and not as seasoned as the sage chicken and waffles. It was also on the dry side. If they added some cheese or hollandaise sauce, I think it would make the dish a lot better. \n\n4.

Nicely seasoned crispy crust on the chicken, and they use the little seen banquet cut called an airline breast. Boneless except for the first joint bone of the wing. And the waffles have a full strip of bacon cooked into them, not just bits sprinkled around. The fried leeks didn't really add much to the dish, and just got in the way. But they, along with the rosemary sprig made for a nice presentation, something you don't usually see with this dish. It's a bit pricy at $16, but the portion is adequate for two meals.

Get the sage chicken even though you might think it's too heavy (it's not). My personal tip is do not order the bloody mary with stone ale. My girlfriend made the mistake of thinking it was topped with stone ale and it's exactly how the bartender explained it to her just in case, beer with non alcoholic bmary mix and she still ordered it and he still offered to get her another drink! Other big tip is that this is not on the strip and it's about 20 bucks just one way on the cab. If you want to stay on the strip go to the Imperial Palace for their other location."

S"so good.  it was a $20 cab ride from the strip but hash house a go go had a good menu and everything we ordered was really tasty so it was absolutely worth the effort.  we had to wait 15 minutes for a table but when we left around 1, there were a whole bunch of people waiting so i'm glad we were able to get there by noon.\n\ni got the fried chicken benedict since if fried chicken is on the menu, i am almost sure to get it.  it was a biscuit sitting on a mound of mash potatoes with egg, a well spiced fried chicken breast, bacon, tomato, spinach and a red pepper cream sauce.  it was a ridiculous amount of food and i'm suprised i didn't go into cardiac arrest just looking at it. \n\ni understand what another reviewer said about their food looking too messy because when my benedict came out, i was overwhelmed thinking about how i was going to eat it.  usually, when i get a giant plate of something, it makes me kind of sick but because it was so delicious, i got over it.  i couldn't even finish half. \n\nmy beverage of choice was the bloody mary.  it was tangy and spicy with a lot of stuff in it, just how i like it.  i didn't think it had much alcohol but as i got progressively more giggly during the meal, i realized i was wrong.\n\nmy friends got the  blueberry pancake (it seriously is the size of a big pizza), the meatloaf hash and the veggie hash and they all really liked their food but the best thing we had may have been the strawberry jam.  none of us are into big chunks of bread and had not touched our biscuits but once we decided to try some of the jam, we basically empied the container onto them and had to have them for later.   it was not too sweet and had a really good consistency. \n\nnow, i'm sad i didn't end up eating the leftovers because we were too busy drinking and gambling.  i would definitely recommend it if you want good, non-buffet food."

S"ALL breakfasts should be this rock-n-roll!\n\nJude and my eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs, but do we care?  Hells no.  Bring on the carbs!\n\nWe shared their griddled French toast *and* bacon waffle.\n\nIn ADDITION, J had sausage gravy with biscuits.  I tackled their HH meatloaf hash - with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, and smoked mozzarella.  It was a brekkie explosion in our booth.\n\nWhen all is said and done, we end up with massive leftovers.  The bacon waffle was good, but not great.  The French toast won out.  This menu has to be one of the best I've seen in a very long time.\n\nNote:  I've been to the San Diego outpost, and it was nice to have a decent waiting area and spacious dining room.  Made the experience that much better."

S"This is one of my favorite places to take visiting family and friends. Be aware that the portions are HUGE. As in, you NEED to split something with someone else, or be prepared to take half of your entree home. Everyone raves about the chicken and waffles, and while it is an impressive spectacle, I found both the chicken and the waffles to be terribly bland. One dish I keep coming back to is the sun dried tomato , goat cheese and basil omelette with crispy potatoes. This thing is full of flavor and tastes ridiculously fresh. The biscuits here are out of this world; you have to try it with the house-made strawberry jam and honey butter! I've also had the chicken biscuit benedict, and it's definitely my second favorite meal at this place. The husband ALWAYS orders the sage fried chicken, and it is ALWAYS delicious! Flavorful, juicy, and you'll have a second portion to take home and enjoy the next day.\n\nFriends I have taken to this establishment always leave disappointed if they order a salad or a sandwich, so, be warned...."

S'Definitely a yummy and unique experience. Ordered the Sage Fried Chicken and Waffles plate to share with my wife. Two plump, juicy, flavorful chicken breast fried golden brown were served over 4 Belgian waffles and topped with fried leeks with a maple reduction and spicy chili oil with diced bell peppers. Simply amazing. All of the flavors worked really well together and the portion was more than enough for 2 adults (we could have actually shared the waffles with our 3 year old. We got him a kids lil tractor breakfast: One giant pancake, scrambled eggs, and a slice of bacon. He ate 1/2 of the pancake and the bacon. So the only thing that we didn\'t love was the price. They kind of gauge you on the drinks and the kids meal prices -- which aren\'t exactly comparable to  other restaurants. I totally understand, "you get what you pay for," and don\'t get me wrong, the food was great. But a $40+ bill after tip for one adult meal, one kid meal, and 2 coffees is kind of a bit much. It cheapened the experience. Oh, and even though it doesn\'t state it on the menu, the waitress said there was a $3 split charge. She  tells us if we order something else that they can count it as a meal and waive the split -- I know, it didn\'t make sense to me either. So we order a side of scrambled eggs al a carte -- which we didn\'t eat -- and never got the plate split. I kind of felt tricked into spending a whole $3 more. Again, 3 bucks not a big deal, but it cheapened the experience.'

S"Maybe because it was Xmas or maybe because I don't like to wait for 4 hours but in any event, this did not meet the hype and in turn, my expectations.  To be fair, there were some outstanding dishes.  The prime rib, for example, was outstanding.  The dessert bar had a great selection of gelato and sorbets. \n\nCompared to other buffets it rates a 7 on a10 point scale.  By comparison, I would rate the brunch buffet at the Sheraton Grand in San Francisco is a 9.5.  The best is the breakfast buffet at the Shangri-la in Hong Kong [a definite 10!]\n\n But all in all, I don't think it was worth the 4 hour wait.  On that note, I think the restaurant could do a better job of managing the long lines.  Knowing that there will be large crowds, they should let customers check in and either have them return at a specified time rather than wait in a long meandering line.  It gets tense and irritable waiting that long."

S"Mmm! A little aways from the strip, but definitely worth the drive.\n\nWe came on a saturday night so we could do the seafood buffet ($33 per person) since it's only offered on the weekend.\n\nSince this place is off the strip, we figured the wait wouldnt be bad, but we were wrong. Wait was about an hour. So don't come starving. Come semi-hungry & have your hunger build as you wait in line.\n\nFOOD\nThey had a very good variety, but probably the most popular items are their crab legs & prime rib. The crab is very fresh, unfortunately the shell is only cracked a little. So you have to do a little work to enjoy your food. (I'm a little spoiled from the other vegas buffets doing it for me) LOL.\n\nThe prime rib was so good! Not overcooked, not overly bloody. The perfect medium. =) That's usually hard to find especially eating prime rib in a buffet setting.\n\nThey also had a good selection of italian (pasta, gnoochi, pizzas), mediterranean (pita & humus), chinese, japanese, american, mexican, & even hawaiian. I loved the kahlua pork. It was really tender & juicy meat!\n\nOf course the most notable is their wine/beer bar. It's included in the price unlike other vegas buffets. It's unlimited! Bummer it's located away from the strip so you can't walk back to your hotel. =p. Overall quality was good & they had a good selection to choose from. Even had dessert wines! =)\n\nDESSERT. Always my favorite station in any buffet. They had ready made crepes (not made to order. DARN!), cakes, fruit tarts, creme brulee, & gelato bar! Another notable thing is they even offer drinks like cappuccinos with your dessert =). You get it at the dessert bar for these specially made drinks\n\nSERVICE\nOur server was good. Tables were cleared off & refills given in a timely manner.\n\nAMBIANCE\nOverall, it looked like a big, modern cafeteria setting. HAHA. Don't get me wrong it's nice. But the way it's structured with the food centrally located in an open circular room made it feel very cafeteria-ish.\n\nDefinitely would come back to get away from the strip & have some good dining."

S"This buffet has to be the best buffet I've been to here in Las Vegas. Came to check it out because I didn't feel like cooking and my boyfriend plays poker at the M everyday, so my mother and I went to go meet up with him for dinner. Went through the VIP line, but the buffet is pretty small compared to all the others, so it took a while to get seated. They have a really good selection and variety. Some out of the norm range like Hawaiian & Greek. To be honest, I do think it is over priced though. Only reason why we came was because the boyfriend gets like 15% off or something for us and my mother gets free buffet comps all the time for here, but hey, if you have money to spend then go for it. I'm currently pregnant, so I didn't get to try the unl. beer & wine bar, but if your coming to get your drink on, then i guess you can say it's decently priced. Lol. The desert bar was amazing! My favorite was the crepes w/ ice cream. They also have a barista so you can enjoy a cup of joe with your desert."

The only thing I wished was that it wasn't 10 miles off the strip :( \n\nLike all other reviewers have stated..there's practically eveything you could wish for here. From fresh crab legs to probably one of the best prime rib I've ever had to the best tasting/assortment of desserts and unlimited alcohol..seriously, what more could you really ask for?? \n\nThe wait time can range from 30 minutes to 2 hours depending on how busy the weekend is. I've waited 2 hours for this buffet in the past and although my legs and back were aching from standing in line, I can definitely say it was well worth the wait. \n\nPrice seems a bit steep but considering they offer fresh seasfood, a vast assortment of good quality meats, and impeccable service, the price is right in my opinion.\n\nWith tax, the best $36.74 I have ever spent/will spend on my past and future Vegas trips to come :) You will not be disappointed!"

S"A 5-star rating for this buffet is definitely under-rated!\n(scroll down for the summary if you don't feel like reading my review, lol)\n\nIf you are looking for a new buffet to try in Vegas, you have to come to Studio B Buffet! I've been here twice with the same group of friends and we all agree that this buffet is better than Wynn's and Bellagio's.  Studio B offers a wide selection and I must say, most of the items on the menu are very de-lish!! (Other buffets only have a couple of selections that are good).\n\nIf you come here, you must try their OXTAIL SOUP... it doesn't look as appetizing, but believe me, your tummy will be pleased and you'll be getting off your seat to get this from the buffet for Round 2.  :-)\n\nOther dishes to try are the GINGER CRAB, Prime Rib (they cook this to perfection! I like mine Medium Rare to Medium Well), Crab Legs (both warm and cold), and BBQ (nothing spectacular but it does taste YUM-O!).\n\nWhile other buffets have Soft-Serve Ice Cream, Studio B offers GELATO!!! Yup, they sure do! They have everything from Vanilla, Yogurt, Strawberry, Mango, Rum & Raisin, Chocolate, Coffee, to name a few.  A couple of my friends in our party really liked the Rum & Raising gelato but because  I don't like raisins, it was hard for me to like it as much as they did--- it wasn't bad overall.  What I did like was the MANGO Gelato! :)  From their dessert  bar, I also tried their Macaroons and Chocolate Chip Cookies.  I'm very picky with how macaroons are made and the ones they make here are definitely worth trying. It's baked to perfection, just like their Chocolate Chip Cookies...Crisp and Chewy!\n\nI must also mention they have FREE BEER & WINE included with the meal price ($29.99/person.... I went here on a Sunday).\n\nCONs:\n-south of The Strip\n-wait time depending on what time you arrive\n\nPROs:\n-nice being away from the strip\n-located inside the beautifully-decorated M Resort\n-Price is not bad compared to other locations\n-Free Beer & Wine\n-Gelato\n-Food: Oxtail Soup, Ginger Crab, Prime Rib\n-Cleanliness\n-Prompt & Excellent Customer Service (during my two separate visits)\n\nOh, be sure to open up an 'iMagine Rewards' card from the hotel so for future visits you'll receive discounts and VIP Line passes to this buffet!

After waiting about 1-2 hours, I stepped into the place and I felt like I was in food heaven!\n\nI know the wait was long, but there was a good deal going on---if you gamble for a certain amount of points, you can eat there for free, or something similar to that. My parents got a buy one, get one free deal. Thus, it's only natural that a lot of people would visit. Just make sure you bring some good friends that you can stand talking to for 2 hours in line.\n\nBut, back to the food: a large selection, for sure--Asian, Italian, American, Chinese--you name it! I definitely liked their veggie selection, too--lots of salad choices. They have dense bread rolls, too, which I love. I can't explain everything I ate, but all of it was pretty decent, especially for a buffet. This is, of course, one of the best buffets I've been to in Vegas!\n\nThey offered great desserts as well--gingerbread man cookies, crepes, fruit tarts, macaroons, and a lot more pastries. The ice cream was great, too--more like gelato texture, nice and moist, not super icy like at most buffets.\n\nI'd definitely agree to come here again!"

After a couple of plates of that, I decided to venture to the other sections and everything was great.

You literally work up an appetite just walking around the room to get your food. \n\nThe wait time can vary. I waited for 2 hours, but this was on Father's day. I'm not sure how long it is normally, but I hear it can get up to the 1 to 2 hours range. \n \nI think what really makes this buffet stand out from the rest though, is their all you can drink beer and wine station. I instantly thought this might not be the best family oriented buffet because of it, but i didn't see anyone abuse it. For light drinkers, I'd recommend trying the cider. For heavier drinkers, remember to save room for the rest of the buffet! \n\nEndless snow crab legs is fun to eat, because it makes such a mess. Maybe we're novice snow crab eaters, but when my cousin and I crack crab legs, meat flies everywhere! Don't be ashamed to bib up.\n\nLastly, don't forget to save room for dessert!!"

We were going to do our usual 4 hour sessions at Manadaly Champagne brunch but one person in our group said this place was better. We all said she was full of s#$t but man it was really better. \n\nFirst off the price is cheaper than other ones(about 25) and it comes with wine and beer in the price. I usually don't have anything but seafood and some prime rib but I have been here a couple times since so I tried the rest of the stuff and bottom line, it is all good. \n\nThis I think is the biggest compliment, I dont have a sweet tooth so I never have dessert. I had a tatse of the gelato and it was soo good I tried almost all the other desserts. Best dessert buffet ever, gelato was smooth, rich and great tatsing. The creme brulee, flan, tiramisu, etc was all small perfect bite size portions and all really good."

Some of my favorite dishes were Prime Rib, Tri Tip, Kalbi ,  Oysters, Snow Crabs, Shrimp, Pai Thai, Beef Curry, flan, and ice cream!.

There were empty table all over! That seemed to be a bit ridiculous. If the place was completely packed, I would have understood, however it wasn't so they definitely need to work on turning over tables..\n\nThe food: mediocre at best. A lot of the food was cold to luke warm. Whether it was the lateness of the hour (although we had 2 hours before the buffet closed) or what, I definitely like my food hot. So that disappointed me.\n\nThe dessert:  probably the best part of the buffet and the reason for my 2 stars.  The meringues were excellent! Perfect consistency and just the right bite to keep you wanting more. I think I had 5.  And the pecan tart? AMAZING!  One of the best I have ever had.  I usually don't enjoy desserts at buffets, but these were worthy of being sung praises! So they need to make sure they hang on to their pastry chef, because the desserts were yum, yum, delicious!\n\nThe waitress was great also, she kept our drinks full and our table clear of empty plates, but was that all enough to plan on another visit?  Maybe not in the near future.\n\nAll in all it wasn't a horrible experience, but not the best either."

S"This was my first meal after arriving in Vegas last week, when I drove here with my parents and boyfriend. Originally was going to take my parents to Hash House for lunch but ended up going here instead because my mom wanted to eat buffet for lunch. For lunch it was only about 16 bucks per person, given that it was a Wednesday afternoon - I am not sure how much it is for lunch on a weekend but I thought it was pretty cheap.\n\nHowever, this time it wasn't as great as the first time. Not sure if it was because it's lunch and not dinner - but the selection was lacking. We were all pretty much starving after the 4 hour drive and I expected the food to be awesome since I was so hungry but I was somewhat disappointed in their quality and selection. I think one factor was that it's a weekday and it wasn't super busy so perhaps they cut out some entrees. However, their dessert selection was awesome and good. \n\nI am not sure what stood out since I didn't actually eat everything but I had a good amount of the food and what I liked the most was the Lamb chops. Even though this time it wasn't as good I still wouldn't mind coming here again. It's pretty decent quality even if they don't have as many dishes as I would have liked."

S"I've eaten at a lot of buffets in my travels all across this grand United States, but I opine that the buffet at The M is hands down the best one to date.  I'll tell you why:  I can eat my worth & wait (you read that correctly, not weight; and it's like $33 and a 40 minute wait for brunch or dinner) there.  Why?  So many reasons, but the main one is the snow crab legs.  You can get 'em on ice or steamed, and I go for the latter.  I've never waited in line for them and they never run out which is amazing since God knows people like me are stuffing ourselves like gluttons with them.  \n\nLet me attempt to describe the dessert bar.  I didn't actually measure the length of this section of delectable, heaven-on-earth, but I'd estimate it's at least 30 yards in length and it caters to sugar-free dessert eaters as well as the rest of us more irresponsible feeders.  They offer every conceivable kind of pie (I didn't check for rhubbard) and cake you can fathom, plus danishes, cream puffs of multiple flavors, creme brule, cakes so beautiful you *almost* feel guilty to dismantle and eat, truffles and at least 10 flavors of gellato.  Maybe you're more of a after-dinner drinks kind of person.  That's fine, too.  They have a full alcohol bar plus an espresso machine so if you'd like a Bailey's Irish Cream hot coffee, just say so (and show your ID).  \n\nWhat's your palette prefer?--Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Italian, American, others?  Don't worry; the M's got your tongue.  I'm a dangerous kind of buffet diner in that my eyes are often bigger than my stomach and so I have to really try not to waste food.  If you suffer from this same kind of temptation, try to pace yourself and do small portions each trip.  There's so much and it's so beautifully, invitingly laid out that you'll want to try it all.   \n\nThe environment is busy, but I never feel rushed to get out.  I mean, for crying out loud, I stood in line almost an hour to get seated so I'm going to take my time.  It's not like they're going to run out of food and if they run out of something, you're probably not going to notice since there's so many choices (unless it's the crab legs, and I've yet to experience that).  There's a loudness to the place, but it's not overwhelming, and that's probably partially because of the wide openness of the eating area.  It's well lit, not too crowded for such a popular establishment, and has a chic decor, but the thing you will never forget is the food--options, presentation, and taste.  It's been about a year since I last ate there and I can't forget the food, but the decor is blurry in my recollection.  \n\nForget what the Travel Channel says about the Strip's buffets; they still will pale in comparison to what The M has to offer.  I hear the rooms are nice, too."

S"My husband and I went here on a Saturday around 3pm. We had no problems with lines or seating. Our waiter was very nice and on top of things. However, we were not impressed with the food. There was a decent selection of food, but the taste was very bland and the desserts were so-so. We expected more from an $86.46(including tax) meal. The mimosas were nice and refreshing and the fact that, that and beer and wine is included is great! \n\nAll in all, the food wasn't the worst we've ever had, but it surely was not the best and with that price tag, for us, it was not worth it."

S'When I told people (friends, coworkers, random nurses at work) I was going to Vegas, literally everyone recommended this buffet.  Everyone.  It\'s cheap, they explained, and the food is just as good as the Wynn.  I mean, you can\'t get a more solid recommendation than that.\n\nSo why is it that after waiting 2 hours in line and shelling out $31.99, I felt so cheated?\n\nOkay, my family doesn\'t drink much, so the endless beer and wine deal was lost on us.  And I don\'t eat much shellfish, so the extra I had to pay for "Seafood Dinner" that weekend was also wasted.  But does that mean that on weekdays the buffet doesn\'t include seafood?  That\'s silly.\n\nHonestly everything I ate was just okay and not even cooked very well.  Prime rib, korean short ribs, lamb, pork ribs...all of the meat was tough and chewy.  And where was the meat selection?  I had to satisfy my lamb craving with tough, overly-sweetened barbecued pieces.  And the desserts...uninteresting and not as extensive a selection as the Wynn\'s.  My whole family agreed that we were disappointed overall with the meal and wouldn\'t be coming back.\n\nWithout all the hype, I probably would have enjoyed Studio B a little more.  But for a buffet that calls itself "The Best Buffet in Las Vegas," it just doesn\'t deliver the goods.'

Well standing in line speaking with a few locals eased the pain of the wait.\nWell worth the wait, Never was able to get to the opposite end because I was so full of the great food selection.\nI never even made it to the desert bar (just amazing looking), Way to full .\nJust another note, Beer & Wine included in lunch & dinner buffets.\n2 Thumbs up from this foodie !\n\nAlso ran into Michael Jackson's dad Joe here."

S"I went for Sunday Seafood Brunch. It's $35, but with crabs and unlimited beer and wine I think it is worth it. \n\nI am biased here, but I liked the Asian style crabs here. Nice flavoring and not overpowering or salty. \n\nThe raw oysters are pretty decent. I wouldn't go for sushi here. Instead I would go to Goyemon. ( I went to 3 buffets while in Vegas for 2 days practically..) \n\nDessert selection is great. They have different flavored macaroons, tiramisu, etc. To be honest I was soo full I could barely have dessert. I did manage to stuff a creme brulee down and it was good. They have the nice sugar coating on top and its creamy. \n\nThe unlimited beer and wine is awesome. I had a mimosa, red wine, and some cider. The cider is delicious. It's pink and I think it has a hint of raspberry in it. Reminds me of Wyder Cider, although Wyder Cider is better. But its unlimited here and I'm not going to complain."

Beer & wine only of course, but  still an amazing deal! Oh and the food is delicious too. A variety of cuisines :) and lots of yummy selections.

They have both hot or cold and just recently cut the legs so you don't have to use the silly tools.\n\n The desserts are a pretty  scrumptious. I like to get the pistachio gelato and the Taramisu..

S"My bf and I came here with a friend that had a few comps to share. So we all 3 ate for the price of 1. It was very nice to skip to the front of the line w/ that players card of his. Well in the 2x that I've been here (only 2 wks apart) I really enjoyed the spicy tuna sushi. Really good - they also have extra spicy tuna off to the side that you can add to the top of this. mm so good. the shrimp pad tai was really good also. Ooh and the orange chicken I had a piece and it was really good. \n\nI also tasted a piece of bamboo salmon or mahi mahi - I wasnt impressed at all. But the sweet potatoes were delicious. Probably the best I've ever tasted. They also serve wine- no riesling but they have chardonnay, cabernet sav, white zif, and you can tip the servers. The dessert line is insane! I didnt even taste the desert the 1st visit. The 2nd time I tasted chocolate souflee wow! That was the best thing I tasted that day. My bf had a great piece of cheesecake, What wasnt good was the creme brulee. UM no. I was most excited about that and it ended up being not great. Kinda sad b/c I've been craving creme brulee for years. yup years. Kinda a let down. THey have everything from icecream, cookies, cakes, pies, crepes, cheesecake, pecan pie, bread pudding. (pass) Its endless. This is probably one of the best buffets in the city. \n\nHowever... this being said... most people come for the crab legs. Ive seen rows and rows of people walking away with 4-6 layers of crab legs piled on their plate. with buckets of butter. We even saw someone walk away with the whole bowl of lemons (the bowl that everyone serves themselves from) and head toward their table. WHAT??!?!?!? and the chef tried to get her to comeback.. and she said what? I need them for my crablegs. and she proceeded to walk bk to her table! OMG. Some people have no shame! NONE. If you get the chance, this place is def. worth a try. Just try to limit yourself b/c its hard to do in this place. Everything looks so good."

The food choices are eclectic:  Chinese, Mexican, Thai, American, Korean, Indian, Meditteranean, etc.  They have cold or warm crab legs with the drawn butter, a meat carving station, and an enormous dessert table which includes sugar free options.  I definitely filled up with my favorites being the crab legs, Korean beef short ribs, and crab bisque.\n\nFrom what the other reviewers were saying, the wait time could be long.

S'Came for lunch on a Monday, Nov 8, 2010.  Walked away happy and full.\n\nThe buffet is located in M Resort, which is off the strip, but it\'s a very nice place.  My draw dropped at the price -- $15.  There was no line (it was a Monday after all).  The cashier lady was super nice, and asked if it was our first time (it was mine, not my date\'s).  She explained that there is a beer and wine bar - all you can drink!\n\n(No thanks though, I\'d rather fill up on FOOD)\n\nI\'m having trouble recalling the decor in detail, and I didn\'t really take pics of the place... I remember it being a very expansive dining hall, slightly reminiscent of a very upscale cafeteria.  Sorry, I\'m sure that didn\'t sound appealing, but, like I said, I\'m having trouble.\n\nI do remember giant screens with food show clips and commercials (situated above the food counters).\n\nAnyway, I would describe the food as very fresh and flavorful.  I remember thinking each plate was at least decent to very good... none that were a miss.  The selection is smaller than Rio, but the quality more than makes up for it.  I would say it\'s almost as good as Bellagio\'s... and considering its price, it has knocked Bellagio from the #1 spot for best buffet in Vegas, imho.\n\nGo, try it out.  This place has my stamp of approval.\n\nOh yea, and they give you nice thick napkins!! (read my other buffet reviews from the "buffet of buffets" trip)'

S"Despite the 2-hour wait (yay, Friday evenings), I am giving this place five stars. I had a crabload of crab to make the best of the $33.99, and the warm crab is so much better than the frozen cra(p) at many buffets. Even having to crack open the crab yourself isn't a problem, and it could be an advantage if you wanna slow down your pace.\n\nI have no idea why the Yelp reviews that I read didn't mention the strange utensil that they provide to crack the crab, but yeah... it's actually pretty cool once you figure out that you have to find the soft parts of the shells (crack toward the wide sides, not the hard corners). Oh, and make sure the pointy end goes in.\n\nMore importantly.. . rum raisin gelato! Most of the other flavors that I tried were great (mango, chocolate chip, strawberry, peanut butter), but rum raisin has always been my favorite. The stuff at this buffet has like 5x the raisins as Haagen Dazs. Heck, pretty much all of the gelato here is way better than any ice cream and most desserts at Vegas buffets. I just wish I had a chance to try the coffee flavor before it ran out, but I guess I'll live... or come back.\n\nWine was decent and beer was fine according to tablemates. Orange juice was way too sweet, so ask them to give you half a glass or something so you can pour your drinking water into it until it's no longer orange sugar water. I enjoy sweet things, but not like this...\n\nOther things to try: roast beef tri-tip (pink-er = tender-er), korean BBQ (flavor might be smeared on but texture is good), osso bucco (broken-down marrow and cartilage somehow are awesome)\n\nStuff to skip: sushi (looks like crap compared to real sushi buffets), anything starchy (too filling), anything you'd find at a fast food place (pizza, fries, much of the Asian area... looking at you) \n\nFinally, please go earlier than I did."

The crab is precut so it turns out to be super dry.  The M used to have big juicy crab legs and now they're small and dry.  The duck I had was rubbery and tasted like the fat wasn't rendered and it sat in the oven too long.  Everything else is just your average buffet aside from oysters they had that wasn't even stocked at all times.  \n\nDont spend you're 40$ per person here.  Spend it somewhere else for better food."

S'I clearly was not here when everyone else was - the buffet was poorly stocked and dirty - there was a wide assortment of items, but it seemed that  "hot" was reserved for the salad plates; many of the hot items were not even warm.  Maybe the unlimited beer and wine makes the food taste better.  The chef on duty did his best, despite being obviously understaffed.  When problems were brought to his attention, his staff who were previously unattentive to both diners and the food, did take corrective action under his direction. The items I sampled bore little resemblance to the photos that magically attached themselves to my post.  My only photos are of pretty empty serving dishes.  A high point of the dining experience was the dessert line, with its wide assortment of creatively presented items.  Overall, I found this buffet to be overpriced and under-whelming.

S'over a number of years have been to a lot of buffets in Vegas including the spice market at  Planet hollywood, the one at Paris Las Vegas and the buffet at the Wynn. \n\nreally good points:\n1) wide open space - one side has a large wall of windows. Room and buffet lines all in rounded circles. gives a sense of open ness. The spice market was in a basement/lower level with no windows. \n\nprice - note lunch was 15.99/person plus tax\n\n2) creative variety of food - I thought the variety a flavor was really good. There was quite a bit of asian but the asian was a wide variety ie filipino, chinese, japanese/sushi, thai, curries, etc. My favorite was the curry variety - I could have taken a quart to go of the green chicken curry.  My daughter said the sliders were to die for including what seemed to be a home made bun. \n\n3) free beer and wine - enough said  -  i have the werewolf which was like a micro brew. yum. They also have a home style root beer on tap for the kids/teens. was also very good. \n\n4) amazing  gourmet desserts- I hate when there are a lot of desserts but they are all cheap/common type. They obviously have a bakery as there were some samples of high end cakes. We had creme brulee, tiaramisu, red velvet cupcakes, mini cheesecake squares, chocolate krispie something, all super good. Also a whole freezer of gelato - looked like what we saw in Italy. \n\nService and seating were okay and as to be expected in a buffet. My husband had had knee surgery so we were able to use the high roller/handicapped line which was good. \n\nThey had some really unique salads also like a glass noodle salad, a hispanic salad with cheese and raw jalapenos, and more. \n\nI give them a five for not feeling closed in, free beer and awesome asian and specialty items.

This place is good but its not THAT good...\n\nI went here for the seafood buffet dinner which is what I heard everyone comes here for and honestly I wasn't that impressed. I admit, there are some selections that I felt tasted very good and very high in quality, but only a few. Everything else was mediocre, better than other buffets like TI but not worth all the hype. I guess a plus was the free wine and beer, that's probably why its so expensive? The dessert section was alright, pretty standard for a good buffet. In my opinion, I still think the wynn buffet is better...maybe even the carnival world buffet in rio too. And for a seafood buffet...they could have had a way better selection of sushi. I was expecting seafood choices more than just the crab legs and shrimp since it was talked about so much from yelp and everyone else. The mahi mahi wasn't that great and the prime rib was kinda dry. \n\nBottom line...I wouldn't waste my time driving from the strip to wait in traffic and then an hour+ in the line and pay $35.

S'By far the Best Buffet in Vegas !!\n\nFor the price and the quality/quantity of food, this place is well worth it, although it is a bit off the strip but sure makes up for it by serving free beer and wine !  I usually make this my last stop before heading back home on the gruesome 15 hwy back home.  Cost for lunch/brunch was $30 and the wait was about an hour. It was MLK weekend so I was expecting it. \n\nWarm crab legs with warm butter sauce ! Yummmm, great assortments of seafood, asian/italian section, salad bar, prime rib, and all the fried foods as well. \n\nDessert bar is also great with all the favorites. And the best part is the beer/wine bar as well. \n\nMake sure to make a stop here on your next trip to vegas'

WHAAAAT? They have the best hard cider i've ever had!!!!\n\nI've been here for lunch, dinner, and seafood dinner. I'd say the best value is the lunch, which still has amazing entree options, like tri-tip. Dinner comes with juicy prime rib. The seafood dinner is a hit or miss - the last time I went, the oysters were super old and the crab legs were still semi-frozen."

S'A little disappointed that the quality of some of the items I used to enjoy there has gone down a lot.  The sushi is now the same stuff you can get a gas station convenient store and the crab legs have very little meat on them and lack flavor. Otherwise the cooked food selection has remained the same and they still offer beer and wine with the buffet.  So overall it was a let down to see this happen.'

S"The best buffet in Vegas hands down!! On the weekends it costs about $30, but this last time I went it was 2 for 1 if you have a Rewards Card... and you better believe I brought mine!!! Wooohoooo!!\n\nThey have a nice selection to choose from and the quality of the food is top notch. Some of my favorite dishes there are the tri-tip steak, prime rib, fried chicken, kalua pig, lomi salmon, and kalbi ribs. Trust me when I say everything is good! They also have crab legs that are piled up pretty high and never seem to run out. I don't like crab, but if you do then you'll be in heaven!\n\nThey also have an all you can drink beer and wine station as well as a pretty good dessert station across from it. At the dessert place they got a good sized gelato selection. I usually get the oreo or vanilla.\n\nWhen ever I am in Vegas it is a must for me and my group to eat at a buffet, and Studio B Buffet is the winner!! Winner, winner, chicken dinner!!"

S"Free wine and beer.. Say what?! That alone already got me eggcited!!! The wines they serve are White Zinfandel, Chardonnay, and Cabernet Sauvignon. It's table wine, but it isn't bad at all. Plus, drinks in Vegas are expensive, so this place is so worth it. The beers they serve are Budweiser, blue ribbon, root beer (haha just kidding), I think they serve other types but I did not drink beer so I am not too sure. There is a bar designated to serve the drinks.\n\nI came here for one of their Thanksgiving holiday specials. The line was ridiculous. We waited for a good 2 1/2 hours around dinner time. We got seated in the back room, which had windows all around the room and we had a pretty view to complement our meal.\n\nAlright, on to the food... I tried their turkey and other food. They also have appetizers to pair with wine such as cheese. They also have oysters, which is always the bomb. I tried to save room mostly for the drinks and desserts! \n\nTheir desserts are really delicious! I ordered their cappuccino because I love coffee!! I also tried their creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, ice cream, fruit tart, tiramisu... All I can say is yum nom nom yum!\n\nI would give them 5 stars if we did not have to wait so long!

The selection of other items was like going to a cheap buffet like you would encounter in a small hick town!\nThey serve cheap quality beer ( colors light, bud, etc...) wine just the same that's why they include it in there buffet price. The so called chefs behind the counter are very nice and well mannered so thats why I gave them three stars that's about it. Been to better ones and will so not my cup of tea here. \nFirst and last.

S"OVER-RATED. \n\nIf you like waiting in line for nearly an hour and a half to experience a mediocre buffet, this is the place for you. Not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but when you get in line, expect that it's really twice as long as it is because people (as many as 10) would join a single waiting person in line near the front. I wish they would have cracked down on this better and not allowed cutting. \n\nLet's get to the food. The sushi is NOT like you see in the pictures. More like dried out pieces of nigiri unagi with crappy California rolls, not lush-looking pieces of tuna neatly arranged on rice. Sometimes they would bring out a piece with shrimp on it but, looking at the quality of the other sushi pieces, I opted to stay away.\n\nThe prime rib and the crab were good, but you can get that at any buffet on the strip. The sides were mediocre, except for the sweet potatoes with bruleed marshmallows on top. Tried a BBQ rib, but it was really tough and dried out. May as well have been microwaved and slathered with sauce.\n\nThe tarts had a mixture of canned and fresh fruit on them. Who wants a tart with a piece of canned pineapple and a canned peach? No thanks.\n\nThe total for two adults (pre-tip) was $76.00. This price was not competetive enough to justify the line. Go someplace else -- like the Bellagio -- and spend a little more to avoid the wait and have a much better dining experience."

S"So after hearing that this is the best buffet vegas has to offer, I had to try it out myself. Came on a saturday night, and knew there was gonna be a long wait since there was already a very long line forming .To make a long story short, it took our party two hours to be seated!! But i must say that the wait was well worth it. Everything I ate was delish! There was a wide variety of food items to choose from. So no matter how picky you are with food, I'm certain that there's something in the menu that would satisfy your palette. Some of my faves were the mahi mahi, prime rib, orange chicken, and the beet salad. Everything was fresh and still piping hot, which is always a plus. Dessert wise, there were lots to choose from: creme brulee, molten choc cake, tiramisu, and the flan were some of my favorites. Will definitely come back to this buffet, but i think next time i will definitely avoid coming here on a holiday weekend.."

S"I have been putting off writing this review because I was trying to recall something positive about the experience.  Here is what I came up with.\nPositive - Beer and Wine is included in the price. And it isn't horrible.\n                  Deserts are great, some of the better Gelato I have had outside of Italy.\n                  a lot of choices.\n                  The chef was very friendly and eager to assist at the carving station.\n\nThe rest of the review - Ok this was a horrible experience from the start.  When we arrived we were sixth in line on a mid week night..  It took us over 45 minutes to get to the cashier and another 30 minutes to get seated.  The cashier was extremely rude and looked at me like I was crazy asking if they had a child discount.  (they do but only for 8 and under which seems kind of rediculous but I highly recommend you go elsewhere with kids 9-18).\n\nSo we were finally seated, ordered our drinks and went to look around.  Although items appear to be grouped together by region of origin, there is no signage and the layout requires you to go around the carving station to get anywhere.  \n\nMy first impression of the food was that it looked good.  I was a bit put off that the cleanliness of the buffet area was so bad.  The setup often requires you to ladle across several items of food resulting in food on the counter and food mixed in with other food.  At most buffets, there are staff members promptly cleaning up the spillage but here i did not see that occur at all. In fact, between my first trip to the buffet and my second, some of the spills were still there.\n\nSpecific issues - the pita was hard as a rock, the rolls were stale, the meat overcooked, Everything appeared to have excessive grease.  The oriental food was utterly flavorless (although the pad thai was servicable if less than a 1 in spice level)\n\nWhen we got back to our table, there were tiny flying creatures around, I had to kill at least two.  I barely ate any of the items on the first plate and went back for a second trip only because i had paid $25.00 and wanted to at least find something edible.  I got mac and cheese and fruit on the second trip.   The fruit was fresh but not quite ripe on the melons and poorly cut as there was rind on several pieces.  The mac and cheese was actually good.  Very cheesey and with cheddar flavored cheese sauce instead of the usual american.\n\nThe place wasn't very busy but we didn't see our server to refill our drinks until we were almost done with the food.  My daughter, who usually loves buffets, only took sushi which she said wasn't very good, and spaghetti and watermelon.  Normally she makes a second trip but she was complaining her stomach hurt by the end of the meal and didn't even eat a desert. (we did get one to take with us which she ate 1/2 of in the car.)\n\nUnder our table was food from the previous customer (I know because neither I or my daughter had the spring rolls.)\n\nAll in all it was a huge disappointment.  I think the majority of people who rate this place high do so because of the free alcohol.\n\nI will not be back here."

The fried foods were everwhere, the salads were picked over, even the plates were dirty. Yuck! I am so incredibly sorry I chose to try this buffet. People of Vegas, you deserve better!

S"Went to three buffets this time in Vegas. I would rank them as follow!\n\n1. M RESORT BUFFET!\n2. Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch\n3. Garden Buffet at South Point Hotel\n\nYes, we were apparently on an off-strip dinning theme this trip. \n\nSo what made M Resort Buffet the best? THE FOOD. obviously. lol. First thing I noticed while walking in was the bar to the left of the entrance, What?! Beer, cider, Coor's light, and lager on tap?! First time I've seen this at a buffet, I got the cider and it was awesome.\n\nYes they have the standard variety of buffet food, definitely all on par with the more expensive buffets in Vegas, but what pushed it to the top of my Vegas buffet list is definitely the aforementioned drinks bar and then the DESSERT! Honestly I only tried the ice cream and the tiramisu that came in a cup, but they were REALLY good. Yum...Peanut butter and cookies n cream ice cream. \n\nI stay away from the Chinese food at every buffet, because quite frankly, none of them are ever good enough to warrant room in my stomach when there's so much other things to eat. I go over, grab my necessary scoop of rice and I'm off on my merry way. \n\nIf I could pick only one buffet to go to in Vegas on any given trip--which is actually what I prefer, three was WAY too much face stuffing for one trip--THIS WOULD BE IT!"

S"Maybe I'm just getting too old for this, but the wait at this buffet in the M Casino Hotel is demeaning if you're not a VIP (those folks get preferential seating) and the cashiers/hostesses exude an arrogant attitude. First you wait on a line to pay and then another line to wait to be seated. It took over 40 minutes for us to be led to our table, and the original line was only about 30 people deep.\n \nThe seafood buffet, however, is pretty good. You can have as much beer or wine as you like with the meal, and for those gavones out there who consider eating a personal challenge, the quantity of food available is eye-popping.  For $29.95 pp, that's not bad.\nThe rating would have been higher if they didn't have that infuriating elitist wait."

S"It's about 7 to 8 miles south of the main strip off the 15 fwy @ the M Resort. If you have a ride and some time, I would recommend the short drive. On weekends they offer some seafood options in their buffet. Apparently on this particular weekend that we went, there was a special deal for lunch time: $16 per person (regular price is about $30ish). Score!\n\nDon't be fooled by thinking that just because the M Resort is located away from all the strip action that people aren't going to flock to this buffet. I highly advise you to come early or at least be ready to wait. Don't say you weren't warned. We got there around 1 pm and had to wait about a full hour before we got seated. By then, we were all starving and ready to eat everything in sight. \n\nI kid you not, there's tons of food here. As I stared at all the selecitons, I couldn't stop thinking about Mike Rowe and that one episode on Dirty Jobs where all the Vegas buffet leftovers are trucked out to the pig farm. \n\nThe food is fresh, clean, and your options is practically endless. There's everything from some sushi, to random Asian selections, to Mediterranean, as well as steam crab legs and boiled shrimp. They of course have prime rib as well as tri tip and ribs available. There's just too much to list. Not everything is a winner but overall you should find a good number of dishes that will entice your taste buds.\n\nLeave room for some dessert. There is an awesome gelato bar accompanied with many other sweet tooth selections.\n\nFor you big drinkers, there's a hidden open bar with unlimited wine and beer. It is located directly to your left as you enter the buffet. Don't miss out on it if you love to booze. They purposely keep it concealed for a reason.\n\nWe all literally rolled out of Studio B quite impressed, retardedly full, and ready to blow some gaskets. M Resort did have their last laugh though because as I was trying to digest all that grub in their casino, their tables robbed me for $250. In conclusion, that meal felt like it costed me $266. Doh!"

S"*I always go to buffets with my friend Gluttony*\n\n\nAs we roll up to the M Resort I walk up in anticipation to Studio B. This was my first time, but a few of my friends had already been. Although I try not to listen to hype they said that it was pretty tootin' n bootin' so I'll have to admit I was a little anxious. \n\nNow we ended up waiting in line for almost 2 hours total (well, for me and two others it was more like an hour. We went and deposited money to the casino while our awesome friends waited in line for us. Thanks you guys *insert cheesy smile and wink*)\n\nOnce we entered they sat us at the back, but it had a great view of the strip, desert, and even more desert. After waiting in line for so long we all went straight to see the spread. Now I have this problem when I go to buffets where when I see something appealing I get excited and get it right away leaving less space for me to get other stuff. In this case there was a giant selection. So as always I end up starting off with two plates. Don't judge. \n\nThere was an impressive layout of seafood and they even had a whole tray of melted butter for crab legs. Be careful though, if you don't eat the butter fast enough it WILL solidify. They have your typical buffet foods, but what really surprised me was that they had CHICKEN ADOBO. For those of you who are not familiar with what that is it's a Filipino dish. I was amazed at the fact that they had this so I had to try it. Everyone at the table tried it, and we all came up with the same conclusion: It was a little salty, but pretty darn good. And we at the table were borderline shocked at how delicious the pad Thai was.\n\nOne thing that I must point out is their prime rib. It was so T-E-N-D-E-R that we used a butter knife to cut it. Yup, that's pretty tender. \n\nDessert bar = extra workout time. \n\nThey also have unlimited beer and wine. I'm sure that just added points in a lot of people's books. \n\nAll in all I really enjoyed the food, and can see myself coming back here. I give it a 5 star rating because it blew my expectations out of the water, and was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food. Give it a try. Hopefully you'll find as much delight in it as much as I did."

S"FOOD POISONING I visited this buffet on my way to Barstow for work. After seeing all the signs along the 15 for how great it was. So my boss and I stop and eat lunch. If it wasn't for the food poisoning the food was average. Nothing was amazing or really attacked my taste buds. 3 stars for good. -2 stars for the food poisoning. As this was the only meal of the day for me I can be certain where I got sick. After we ate we were a little bummed because the food really wasn't that great. \n   Once we got to our hotel in Barstow California we went to our rooms to rack out. At roughly 7 pm I was in a fever and sweating and legitimately hallucinating. I called my boss saying something was wrong( I don't remember doing so). My boss got me into the car and took me straight to the hospital. I don't remember the trip or even when my boss got into my room and took me downstairs. I got to the ER with a fever of 103 degrees. They did their magic and I'm still here:) The scary part was when the doctor told us that I wouldn't have made it to morning had I not been taken to the ER. Btw my boss also had food poisoning. As we had tried differant foods it coulda been anything. Wanna know the kicker? Barstows hospital gets at least one FOOD POISONING a week after eating at the M. I guess that Barstow is the half way point of people coming from California and they get sick going home? \n   To wrap this up. DO NOT EAT HERE! It's not worth 1700 dollars on hospital bills(after insurance). I really wanted to like this place. But for as long as I live this place will NEVER get a sign off from me. Go to the Bellagio for your vegas buffet fix. I've been three 6 times. Never almost died."

The food is incredible and tasty, unlike most other buffets that are just mainly greasy and all the food tastes the same. \nYou must try the lamb, I was pleasantly surprised. The red thai seafood curry is very spicy. I love that they include beer and wine in your dinner, and they also serve cappuccinos and lattes in the deser area. You can even ask them for flavored syrup or a shot of alcohol in your gourmet coffee. Make sure you make room for dessert, their merengues are wonderful and the cream puffs are some of the best I've had.\nMust try: tomato bisque soup, mozzarella and tomato, stuffed grape leaves, seafood combo, kbbq, lamb, tri tip.\nPass: sushi (the rice was a bit dry), mashed potato, fried chicken..pretty much anything that you can get for cheap elsewhere.\nMy usual strategy for buffets: skip the unneccessary carbs (rice, pasta, potatoes, bread) to make room for the foods you only get to eat once in a while."

FIFTEEEEEN DOLLARS! ALL YOU CAN DRINK BEER AND WINE! I felt that this was caps-worthy news.\n\nThey boast over 200 menu items available, and it was quite clear once we quickly entered the buffet after a short wait. The buffet line snakes around and includes all sorts of ethnic dishes.\n\nNoteworthy:\n-pasta salads and mixed salads (huuge variety!), eggplant parmesan, mac and cheese w/ ham, tortellini!\n-tri-tip, rotisserie chicken (super moist), meatloaf w/ mushroom sauce, carne asada! YUM\n-3 types of curry: green chicken curry, beef panang, and red seafood curry. They were all so flavorful and delicious! Better than some thai restaurants I've been to.\n-chocolate crepe, fruit tart, cream puff, creme brulee, and cheesecake w/ raspberry sauce were all delicious\n\nJust so-so:\n-chicken enchilada was salty\n-fried chicken was good but greasy\n-orange chicken and teriyaki chicken were okay\n-macarons\n-gelato.. not as good as I've had elsewhere\n\nDrinks:\nyou have a good selection of beer, including Heineken on tap! We also had some raspberry cider, and wine choices.\nAt the dessert station there are made-to-order cappuccinos/espressos/lattes which you can add baileys or amaretto to! :)\n\nWe were also given raffle tickets for free buffets but didn't win :(\nand the other catch was, there was no seafood (crab legs, oysters, etc) but only a seafood buffet on Friday nights for $30, which I would come back and try sometime! I would definitely have to say for $15 we were thoroughly satisfied and happy. Although this is not considered a gourmet buffet with fancy items, rather more simplistic items, the quality is not sacrificed at all.\n\nOverall well deserved 4.5 star rating."

I wasn't a fan of the Asian food offerings but liked the paella and some of the fish they had. The best part of the lunchtime buffet was the dessert offerings - they had creme brulee and tons of gelato, cheese cakes, and lovely little shot glass cups of creme, raspberries, and other delicious desserts. It's way far from Vegas but worth it to drop by here since the resort is pretty and nice to walk around."

Alright the real story was my friend had a local friend that met up with us and took us out here to eat. We went for lunch on a Saturday and I must say the quality and selection was pretty good. They still had some breakfast food out which I love, but it wasn't great. Their other items were pretty tasty though. They had everything from Asian  to midwest to southern comfort foods - all pretty good. The paella I got was a little watery though, but still pretty good. I managed to get like 3 plates of food and couldn't do anymore. They had a nice dessert section too that I passed on. Supposedly alchohol is free here too and they had some type of wine station too. I guess I would come here again if I rented a car in Vegas, otherwise it is a little out of the way."

I think I tried at least half of the desserts and two little scoops of ice cream! They even have a little coffee/ espresso machine thing and you can order drinks for after your food. And speaking of drinks, they also have a DRINK bar, yes, those kinds of drinks. Beer, wine, I'm not too sure about the particular brands, but there was always a long line there when I passed by so it must be good!"

S'Awesome buffet away from the Strip. We visited here for lunch on the day of New Years Day, and were expecting inflated buffet prices as we had seen at the buffets on the Strip, however it was the standard $14.95 here. This buffet is an awesome deal. There is so much selection that it could please almost any palate. While there was a huge amount of selection, I felt that the quality was a bit lacking, however, still delicious. The buffet would have been worth it for the food alone, however the all-you-can-drink wine and beer (for those of age) and awesome dessert line-up quickly jettisoned this buffet to my #2 go-to buffet in Vegas. We will definitely be back.'

The prime rib was one of the best prime ribs I've had in awhile and everyone in my party agreed, this was my favorite item.  Their osso bucco was also good; it was falling off the bone. Enjoyed the raw oysters but had to limit myself since I was trying to sample EVERYTHING. I was struggling to get to dessert. They had this tasty dark chocolate rice crispies and if I was ghetto fab I would bring Tupperware to sneak some out (BTW I'm not but tempted perhaps a Ziploc bag in the future ;p). They have good portions to their dessert so you don't feel like you're wasting food. The panna cotta came in shooters and I had 2. Wine and beer is part of the package but since I'm lightweight, I didn't sample. Definitely coming back."

S"Another one of my favorite buffets!!! No, it's not on the strip. Yes, it's at the M Resort... Yes, M Resort is that one hotel off the 15 surrounded by absolutely nothing where you can see the lights and hotels of the strip in the distance.\n\nTotally worth it.\n\nAlong with the buffet comes unlimited drinks. And by unlimited drinks I mean beer, wine, and cider. For free. Although, you should be nice and tip them lol\n\nSo at Studio B they have the weekday lunch buffet, which does NOT have the crab legs and other seafood. It's a little more boring, but also because the price is MUCH cheaper. Then they have weeknight buffets and then the weekend seafood buffet. I love the weekend seafood buffet because they have snow crab legs (hot and cold), raw oysters (which are just eh-- but they're raw oysters and you're in Vegas, you can expect them to be fresh LOL), shrimp, paella, etc. There's a bunch of dishes that you can't find during the rest of the week.\n\nThere's an incredible selection of food. I usually start at the end with the pizzas and salads. By the time I'm halfway through the line my plate is full and overflowing. I always get prime rib, but that's partly because I want to get my money's worth in food. Whenever I come for the seafood buffet, my boyfriend and I get at least one full plate of crab legs, piled high like a mountain. \n\nI never eat the sushi there or the Asian food, but that's also because I feel like it's a waste of precious stomach real estate when you eat orange chicken and eggrolls at a buffet like this.\n\nThere's a huge dessert selection as well. I don't like the desserts as much as I like Wicked Spoon's desserts. Their gelato's just ok, but I always get some because I can't say no to ice cream lol. They have a lot of dessert shooter type things in mini cups that are just okay as well. Their creme brulee's not bad though. They serve espresso and coffee in that dessert section as well, but I'm usually all tapped out to get anything from there."

S"Before Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon, the buffet at M resort was probably my second favorite after Wynn and Bellagio.  Nowadays, the buffet list has shifted a bit as Bacchanal is king for me.  However, the M resort buffet is still a very good buffet. It's usually the buffet I go either on the way into Vegas or on the way back home since it's nowhere near the strip.  It's also the only buffet that I've been to that includes beer, wine, or champagne without an upcharge.  The selections here are your typical premium buffet options such as crab legs, sushi, a carving station, good dessert bar, etc.  It's clean and I like that there's a lot of room to maneuver around the food stations.  Come here and stuff your face before you head back to Cali."

S"Saturday brunch is around $45 with fees.  For $45 in vegas the food better be special.  While the selection is vast and the service is excellent, the food wasn't as good as I expected.  \nThe good:  the fried chicken, prime rib and lobster bisque were great.  The gelato was also very, very good.   \n\nThe bad:  the sushi was tastless and dry, the Chinese offerings seemed to be over heated, maybe warmed up too long because no one was eating it.  Eggs benedict was dry the muffin tough.\n\nThe ugly:  the snow crab is served both steamed and chilled (nice) but the crab pieces were very scrawny, a really skinny legs without much meat.  I haven't ever seen such skinny offerings ever at a buffet.\n\nSpecial note: there is a selection of all you can drink alcoholic beverages(beer /wine) but if you don't drink a lot it's a non-benefit.\n\nOverall, not worth the $45 price point.  Something in the mid to low $30s would have been reasonable, even cutting out the alcohol. It might be a fair deal for a weekday lunch."

S"I was born and raised a buffet fiend.  I've been to a ridiculous amount of buffets throughout my almost three decades of life...Studio B is my absolute favorite of all time.\n\nI've been to Studio B more than ten times and I swear, it never gets old for me.  Here's the thing though...I've never paid full price here (because price tends to take on a big role in distorting my opinion and discourages my generous star ratings).  Call me cheap, heck, I'll call MYSELF cheap, but I ain't paying over $25 for a buffet...that's a hard limit for me.  So, we go when and ONLY when we have our handy dandy BOGO deals that the Rewards Card people send out.\n\nOk, so we've established price is not my favorite thing about this place, let's just get the other unpleasantry out of the way...the amazingly ridiculous line that you often have to wait in.  Waiting in line to eat has to be one of the most miserable things EVER so, that being said, try to prepare yourself (we've waited for at least an hour and a half on one occassion).\n\nI've been for breakfast once, but I'm not a breakfast person and enjoy the lunch and dinner buffets quite a bit more, so this review is sort of geared more toward those two.  For starters, the place is big, bright, beautiful and pretty modern-looking.  It never looks dirty even though it's constantly crowded.  Also, the servers here are some of the NICEST and fastest people I've come across in the big booming buffet industry.\n\nNow, to the food...I always start with their sushi-type rolls, Hawaiian poke and the lomi lomi (salmon) -- this fills my plate.  My second plate is MORE lomi lomi and all the Asian food I can pile onto my plate.  If there are crab legs, those are next.  I also appreciate the Mediterranean, Mexican, Seafood and soul food.\n\nAfter I've decided I can't stuff anymore lomi lomi mixed with other foods into my belly, I head over to the dessert section and go straight to the tiramisu.  I grab a few cookies, crepes if they're making them, mini souffle, gelato (to wash down the souffle), and a fresh to order cappuccino.\n\nWhile all of this strategic eating is taking place, I'm also usually helping myself to the complimentary (well, included...) beer and wine.  I like the M Cider too :) Yum.  Gosh, I'm so hungry right now..."

For $30, the food is great...but not worth the 4 hour wait..\n\nFood: Quality stuff, prime rib, oysters, crab legs, all sorts of desserts and foods :)\n\nOverall: I'm sure I wouldve enjoyed it a lot more if I wasnt sleepy, starving and tired. 3.5 stars."

Desserts.  this isn't your half assed attempt at dessert done by most buffets.  this is a go-back-for-a-2nd-creme-brulee-even-if-you-feel-sick type of dessert spread (which i did).  They have lots of yummy stuff, most notable is the creme brulee and the gelato!\n\n3.  Selection.  they have so much food there and it's all delicious.  the asian food is notable.  usually, there's a little lame asian section with some orange chicken, a lame attempt at noodles, and teriyaki chicken.  however, the M respects their asian folk and gives us something worth our money.  pad thai, kalbi ribs, very good stir fry, sushi (yes, you heard right, sushi), and my personal favorite - oxtail soup.  it was SO good! \n\nmy boyfriend and i had a great experience here.  the wait is long so be sure to go well before you're hungry.  he absolutely stuffed his face and will go back again every time we're in vegas."

S"Let me just start off by saying that I love buffets.  I've tried them all, from the Rio's Carnival to Red Rock's Feast buffet.  I rarely find a buffet that doesn't impress me, but that is just what happened at Studio B.  It started off just fine, my girlfriend and I got in line and when we came to the cashier she was real nice. We got our discount for using our players card and got in line to be seated and saw the decor of the buffet and it looked real nice. We were then taken to our seat near a window with a nice view of the city.  Nice.  That was the extent of my satisfaction with this buffet.  \nI head to the buffet and I like to scope out all the different types of foods. I first notice that there were no signs above the areas stating the type of culture the food was (i.e. Some places will have a sign or something saying 'AMERICAN' or 'KOREAN').  So I figured I would just have to rely on the signs with the food stating what each item was.  There were none.  Nothing to let me know what food was what.  Didnt know if I was putting Mandarin chicken on my plate or Mongolian pork. Didnt know what the pastas were because there were no labels.  No labels for the soups.  I just had to assume I knew what I was doing.  So, I grab a few familiar foods (can't go wrong with white rice) and head back to my table, only to find people sitting at it.  Huh? I see a waitress and ask her what the deal was and she said they moved us.  Moved us?  WOW! Thats new to me.  So I sit down and our waitress asks what we want to drink, we order 2 diet cokes and begin to eat.  About 10 minutes later (which in Las Vegas buffet time is an hour) I see our waitress loaded with drinks strolling around with a dumbfounded look on her face as to what drinks go where.  She begins to hand off drinks to various tables and with 1 drink left passes by our table when I ask her where our drinks were.  She says 'Oh diet? Ok take this one.'  She gives us her leftover that she couldnt find...and the soda was flat. \nNow for my second plate.  I want meat so I go to the carving station and look at what they have.  I see the turkey and I approach and ask for a couple of slices (Note: I LOVE Thanksgiving, I love turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy and all that).  I get a couple of slices and look around....um...where's the turkey gravy?  To my chagrin, the cook tells me there is none.  WHAT? You have turkey but no gravy??? 'Ya', replied the cook, 'I don't get it either'.  So what am I supposed to drench my stuffing with...wait...there's no stuffing either?  Thats right.  No turkey gravy. No stuffing.  Just dry turkey.  And the mashed potatoes are in a completely different area.  I ask the cook had anyone else asked about there being no labels with any of the food and his response was 'Yesterday just about everyone asked that'.  Now I'm losing hope. \nFinally, I begin to make my way to the dessert area which is a line like you would see at a cafeteria.  50% of it was flan and when finally reaching the only thing that looked appealing, the gelatto, I asked for some.  The lady presented my scoop and instead of asking, 'Anything else' or 'Is that enough' or anything to the sort, instead she RUDELY tells me to please me along.  I felt like I was in the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld.   Funny thing is I had to backtrack the line just to get to the toppings!!! We ate dessert and left for home.  But it doesnt end there.  Our total was about $34 dollars for the both of us after our discount.  However, when we got home and my girlfriend checked her online statement, they had somehow charged her $41!  Ugh...So now we're trying to get this fixed.  \nAll in all, this was the WORST experience I have ever had at any buffet and if it was possible to give it zero stars for wasting my time I would.  Mr. Marnell wants to cut down on outsourcing to other owners and adding multiple investors in his property to ensure better customer service but last night felt more like he was cutting corners.  I do NOT recommend this buffet to anyone."

WARNING:  their portions are SCARY HUGE.  i recommend sharing at this place regardless of what you order.  they send home leftover pancakes in a small pizza box to give you an idea.  all the items i saw or ordered came on platters or giant round plates that must have weighed five pounds alone.  a woman next to us the night we went in for dessert ordered a chicken pot pie which looked like a giant flying saucer of crust had crashed into it.  for my first trip, i got the fried chicken benedict which was good, but a little too much and too heavy for me.  my other trips were all about that banana brown sugar pancake.  trust me, if you like bananas, you can't go wrong."

Everyone knows how big and artery clogging this could be but i ate every bit of it. I loved the everything the benedict came with, however i wished it came with poached eggs not fried egg. I love the drippy egg yolks, too bad it wasn't on this one. The biscuit and mashed potatoes were good. It did get very heavy and difficult to eat but with everything together a piece of egg, tomato, crispy bacon, and a piece of that juicy chicken made it more delicious.  The chicken wasn't too crispy because of the sauce but it was nice and juicy, not dry at all. I must say...those tomatoes are AMAZING. So sweet and juicy. If there was a whole one on my plate...i'd eat it like an apple. It was that good (I love tomatoes). \n\nWe wanted to eat there again before we left but it was not possible. They need to open later on sundays too!! People are still hungry!\n\n\nService was great, the wait was about 30-40 mins but it really wasn't that bad, it went by fast. Just go down stairs to gamble a little to kill some time. \n\n-GO ! (a must go you might like it or you might not, but you should try)\n\n\n\nP.S.: Share the plate. Everything is HUGE."

S'Despite all the fantastic reviews, I refuse to force myself onto the "A Go Go" hype.  The aesthetics of every plate is amazing, however I find it unpractical and more or less of a disturbance to eat around (or figure out of how eat).   \n\nI wanted to try this place out for quite some time now, especially since a ton of my facebook friend\'s have been checking in and promising how delicious their chicken and waffles are so on my last day in Vegas I decided to make a detour to the airport and grab myself a brunch with a well needed bloody marry. \n\n1.  Parking.  You\'re forced to park inside of the Quad Resort parking lot and if you have a large vehicle I\'m pretty sure security will harass you to make you not park in their three story parking lot (They did that to my brother in law).\n\n2.  It\'s a maze just to get to the restaurant.  Gotta walk through a hall way, go up a fancy elevator, then go into some corridor to get to another elevator, walk through a casino, walk up a flight of stairs and then boom, you\'ve found waldo.  \n\n3.  No bathrooms.  Nope.  No restrooms in the restaurant.  You\'ve gotta manage your way down the stairs, across the casino, and walk through a little mini shopping strip just to get to the restrooms.  \n\n4.  When I stopped by their filter in the water was down.  No complementary water, so you\'re forced to shell out the $3 for a bottle of water. And if you do decide to order that bottle of water, think nothing much of it \'cause it\'s more like an 8 oz. bottle.  No refills, just blow another $3.\n\n5.  Ordered the chicken and waffles.  For some odd reason there was an over exaggerated amount of rosemary and onion spread throughout my plate.  The syrup was less than half filled in the small condiment cup and when I asked for another one (since I was sharing with my boyfriend), it took them 5 minutes to bring us another small cup of syrup.  By then, the chicken and waffle was cold.  Oh, weren\'t we supposed to have eating utensils too?  That took another 10 minutes to get that and an additional plate to eat with.  \n\n6.  I found their bloody marry\'s to be quite delicious, however I didn\'t need the collectors cup (which I didn\'t know was at an additional fee...heck, I didn\'t even know that there was a regular plane jane bloody marry) so I ordered another one.  Took a long amount of time to get that second and when I asked the server to rinse out my "collectors" cup, he forgot to come back and get it rinsed for me so I had to ask again.\n\nMaybe I just had an off the wall bad experience, maybe not?  But I\'m pretty sure the next time I crave for chicken and waffles, I\'ll just buy a box of Krusteez and a small box of Popeyes chicken.'

S"Great first experience had me back a second time in a weekend! First of all, it is true, be ready to share! Don't be a pig! And be ready to wait as well on some mornings. The wait sucks, but the place is good! The line to the hostess stand is usually crowded with people waiting, so make sure to go up front and talk to someone. Most likely people are waiting and not in line. \n\nOnce seated, the friendly server got our drink orders in and out to us in a jiffy! I had the Chorizo skillet - pretty tasty and HUGE! my wife had the Sundried tomato, basil & goat cheese scramble. We also had a Traditional Buttermilk pancake. Was really good! The coffee hit the spot as well, forget the swill at the buffet, this was a good bean! Wife had the Bloody and it was fantastic in all its greatness. Really tasty too!\n\nI noticed alot of people taking pics of the gigantic plates of food and were laughing at the idea of actually finishing the food in front of them. So share if ya can. I did not finish the feast, but as I rolled out the door, there was a smaller line of hungry people that were pissed because I was grinning from ear to ear in full happiness! \n\nTry it at least once."

The Benedict is a lot of freakin food, and gets cold quick if you don't hoover it.  The Chicken and Waffles seems to hold together fairly well.  Don't think this is a classy joint...because it isn't.  This is a spit on the floor and curse at your friends kind of place...but it has great food.  Lots of freakin kids too.

S'Has House A Go Go makes sin taste so good! \n\nBeing from Indianapolis it was quite interesting to see this "Twisted Farm Food", which was every bit of delicious. Granted, we don\'t really eat like neanderthals in Indy it was perfect. \n\nMy fiance and I both enjoyed the Kiwi Watermelon lemonades - beautifully made with an even better taste. \n\nHim: My hubby got the rosemary chicken skillet (something like that) which was an absolutely delectable serving of roasted chicken, fried potatoes, egg and turkey bacon. The chicken was perfectly seasoned with flavorful rosemary and paired with perfectly cooked potatoes, being served in a sizzling hot skilled. My hubby is a cop-out and got scrambled eggs (so you can\'t really mess that up). \n\nMe: I had a "Tractor Platter" with french toast which was perfectly seasoned with egg and cinnamon, and topped with powdered sugar (yum!). The best thing, the french toast wasn\'t some tiny piece of bread but real Texas toast - this was in turn served with delicious crispy shredded hash browns (cooked to perfection), which for some reason no other restaurant can seem to get hash brown crispy. Kudos to Hash House A Go Go on that. The final part of my dish was fantastic - a serving of fresh fruit, a banana sliced long, and a couple slices of orange. The banana was a great surprise because, they actually threw it on the grill, which was a taste of perfection. It enhanced the sweetness of the banana without completely caramelizing it. (It was so great that my hubby almost lost his finger because he couldn\'t stop munching on it)\n\nOverall Hash House A Go Go is a definite must while visiting Vegas (I absolutely fell in love with this place) - and will certainly be back on my next trip to Sin City.'

Put your name on the list then go enjoy the casino but make sure to come back a little early because I think they quote their wait time a little longer.\n\nMy friend and I split the sage chicken benedict. I'm a sucker for all eggs benedict dishes. However, it's not a benedict because the eggs aren't poached, but the scrambled eggs were pretty good! It was a huge sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, bacon, tomato, mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs served on a biscuit with mashed potatoes. I wasn't able to finish my half of the meal it was so large! \n\nI wasn't blown away by the taste of the food, but the size was pretty enormous.

Service was efficient and fun, the atmosphere is upbeat and then the food. Wow are these some big plates! Had the chorizo jalapeno hash, the chorizo is made in house and is a perfect balance of flavor and heat, without the overuse of salt that so often happens, served over crispy potatoes it was delicious.

S"I'd like to start out by stating I was fairly hung over the day we went to Hash House A Go Go. After a long hard night for my liver, I had to suffer the traditional morning hangover which ended up stretching into the afternoon (at which time we finally began our quest for food to rid this ailment). And even though the hangover symptoms had started to abate by noon, they were still present and included head ache, nausea, and disdain for flashy lights and loud noises. That being said, we  walked in the blaring heat on the strip, navigate through a loud casino, and wait almost an hour to be seated and place an order.\n\nI only complain about the situation I was in so that you can realize how good the food must have been to get me to stop my bitching and give this place 4 stars. The corned beef sandwich was garnished with rosemary, and the bread was buttered and toasted to perfection. The cheese to meat ratio was spot on as it enhanced the flavor without overpowering it. And the meat. So succulent and savory, my taste-buds went into overdrive trying to keep up. The portions were well aligned with the price as this is no Dennys or Ihop. The price may be around doubled, but so are the portions and the flavor is increased 3 fold. I could not even fathom finishing, even on an empty stomach with no hangover. This hearty meal was just what I needed and allowed me to recover my strength mentally, physically, and emotionally.\n\nAll in all this was a great way to help with a hangover. The only flaws I saw which stopped me from giving the 5 was the long wait and rigorous route needed to find the place in the middle of the casino. I'll recommend this place for a decently, delightful devouring during daddy's drinking day recovery."

Both times I have gotten the sage fried chicken, once atop an eggs benedict and most recently as the famous chicken and waffles. I highly recommend the chicken and waffles, it's all sorts of food goodness. There's bacon infused in the waffles, the chicken is juicy, fried with corn flakes and drizzled with a hot maple reduction, and topped with fried leeks. Awesome!  A+ for the bloody mary BLT which came topped with an actual make your own BLT, which was a perfect snack while waiting for our food."

S"This place serves heart attack on a plate.  And hope you don't drink your water too quickly because service is nonexistent at this place.\n\nSurprisingly the food is good at this joint.  Upstairs in the Quad Hotel (do not ever stay here, horrible rooms), this place serves the famous fried chicken benedict.  I can't even believe how massive this plate is.  I asked for it without bacon since I can't eat pork.  The meal itself tastes amazing (for those rare indulgences I do with fried food).  The chicken was succulent, the scrambled eggs and cheese were hot and delicious, the mash potatoes were good, the biscuit was a little dry.  Love the chipotle cream, not too heavy, I asked for it on the side.  I like that they add tomatoes and some greens in there so you get a little bit of veggies.  \n\nMy sweetie had the corned beef hash.  I thought it was too greasy and the corned beef was too chewy.  It comes in a large griddle.  My God, we could have easily shared one dish.\n\nI'd say this is great for hangover breakfast spot.  I am disappointed our waitress never checked on us ONCE the entire visit.  \n\nFood 4 stars\nService 2 stars\n\nI think my waistline and arteries are protesting after this Vegas trip."

It was one of those meals where we didn't speak to each other, just chewed and went 'mmmmmmm' a lot.\n\nBy the end of the meal, he said next time we go to Vegas, we're staying at The Quad, just so we can be closer to HHAGG.\n\n(Also, we went on a Thursday afternoon in October and there were only a few other people, so if you want to avoid the lines, this might be a way!)"

However, while we were waiting, the server never came back to update us on the food, refill our drinks, nothing. Over an half passed. I could see our server joking around and talking to the other workers behind the bar. Finally our lukewarm food comes and still no one checks on us. No one ever refilled our drinks. I\'ve had the same drinks in SD and the presentation was much better. My gfs champagne supernova in SD had a sugar rim and garnishes. This one literally looked like dirty dish water, had no garnish, and our server told us to "make sure to give it a good stir" because the bartender sure as hell didn\'t.

Once getting seated our waiter informed us that it would be another 45 minutes for our food once we ordered. I wanted to leave right then and there but we waited out of sheer desperation. They should at least give you some bread or something to munch on if you're waiting that long. I got the first farm Indiana special, which was sage fried chicken, bacon mashed potatoes, eggs, and a biscuit.\nThe chicken was extremely dry, and the only hint of sage flavor was the dry rosemary they threw on top.\nThe BACON mashed potatoes was just mashed potatoes with two slices of bacon on top. Not horrible, but deceiving from the menu description.\nI got my eggs over medium. They were good, but how hard is it to mess up eggs?\nThe biscuit was good, but very dry and sucks up any ounce of moisture in your mouth without any butter or jam or syrup. \nThe display was elaborate and pretty, ill give them that.

It doesn't fit in very well with Imperial Palace's oriental theme, but that didn't stop us from coming in.\n\nEater beware: the portions are HUUUUUGE. Our friends made the mistake of ordering a dish for themselves, and left at least half of it. Thankfully, I decided to split a dish with a friend, so we ended up finishing it all.\n\nI ordered the infamous Safe Fried Chicken & Waffles. I really didn't know what to expect, so I was surprised when I was served a sculpture. Yes friends, this was a work of art. Four waffles beautifully arranged with two chicken breasts skewered on top, covered with shallots and other garnishes. \n\nThe waffles didn't have too much syrup on them, which is exactly how I like it. To my surprise, there was bacon cooked into the waffles, which was a pleasant surprise. The chicken was pretty lightly fried, which I enjoyed as well. The crust was sweet, but not too sweet, which was a good contrast to the savoury chicken. \n\nOverall, a great must have experience if you've in Vegas, and not too pricey at all.

I didn't even get through half of mine.\n\nThis rating isn't for the food -- would've given it more stars if the service hadn't been ridiculously slow.  It took a good 5+ minutes after we were seated before out server even acknowledged us, 10-15 minutes for drinks to arrive, and another 30+ minutes before the food actually got to the table.  It wasn't even very crowded when we went (after 1pm on a Saturday)."

S'Been to the San Diego Hash House a few times already, so I knew what to expect when coming to this one, other than it being nestled in a Smokey Old Hote/Casino, but that pretty much describes every restaurants that\'s stuck on the Las Vegas Strip. \n\nA vey stark contrast in design from the very San Diego Hillcrest location, where there\'s an outdoor patio and warm earth tones and sometimes a DJ on the weekend, to a very cafeteria interior. \n\nSame items on the menu, breakfast is the way to go, when you go to Hash House A Go Go. I also recommend going when you are ready to inhale a huge portion and probably make this your meal of the day. These are generous portions. Since we were in town for meetings and a tradeshow, felt it was the safer route to just have the freshly squeezed tangerine juice, god bless Vitamin C, you know you\'ll need some when you\'re walking through the smokey casinos and doing a little imbibe during your time in Vegas. \n\nWent the "healthy" route with the farm scrambled with ground turkey, broccoli and mushroom along with their addictive crispy potatoes that are perfectly crunchy and charred. Oh but there\'s more, a homemade  biscuit is included with this meal. Suppose if you need the extra iron, there\'s a sage leaf that\'s included as a garnish that you could try to gnaw off on. \n\nA friend also got the frisbee sized pancakes, didnt try them, but he seemed to enjoy them and again did I mention frisbee sized?\n\nWe all did a good job with stuffing our bellys as much as we could. Service is decent, food comes out quick. On another day when you don\'t have any business meetings, etc I\'d say get a cocktail, I\'ve had them before and just a nice way to top off a soon to come food coma. \n\nGood alternative when you\'re sick of buffets and any other non descript restaurant that may be in your hotel for breakfast or brunch.'

S"My cousins have been here, and we almost went one time while in Vegas.  The wait was too long, so we never went.  \n\nOn a trip to Vegas during the week, my boyfriend and I decided to go and try it out.  We walked in, no wait, PERFECT.  Our server was Josh.  He was super friendly and great.  We had the 100oz of Fat Tuesday's, and he talked to us for a while about it and helped me with transferring some into a different container.  \n\nWe went for lunch and ordered the Sage Fried Chicken with the bacon waffle, hot maple caramel reduction and fried leeks and Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs.  They came out with the quickness, but then again they weren't all too busy.\n\nBoth were amazing!!!! Try them.  The only thing I didn't like as much was the chipotle cream.  It was too thick.  Prices were also reasonable for the portions.  I'll definitely come back. :) Thank you Josh"

S'You shall find this amazing breakfast/brunch restaurant inside the Quad Resort & Casino.\n\nCame here during early Saturday morning and there was no line at all. Service was top notch - probably the best service I\'ve ever had for a breakfast place. \n\nSage Fried Chicken & Waffles (two chicken breasts w/ hardwood smoked bacon, waffle tower, hot maple reduction, fried leek - $16.95, New York Times Favorite) - First of all, I was completely astonished by the decoration. It was such a simple piece of art - fried leek stick on top of fried chicken. Honestly, fried chicken wasn\'t mind-blowing (not super juicy, but not horrible either). The bacon-infused waffle was interesting, but wasn\'t as fluffy and great tasting as I thought. Nonetheless, fired leek was pretty good! \n\nIn terms of taste, I would probably give 3.5-stars. However, its amazing / friendly service, huge portion of food, and beautiful decoration (the "surprise" factor) definitely enhanced my overall dining experience. I am more than happy to come back here and something different next time.'

S"As I am sure is the case with many, my boyfriend and I were made aware of this place through the Travel Channel's Man v. Food show.  The host visited the Hash House a Go Go on Sahara, and he tried the fried chicken eggs benedict.  My boyfriend was hooked--when we went to Las Vegas at the end of last month, he insisted upon a visit.\n\nFortunately for us, we discovered that there is a second location in the Imperial Palace, which was right down the street from where we were staying.  In order to check on the times when certain food is served, my boyfriend repeatedly tried to call them with no answer at least the first two times.  \n\nThe restaurant is easy to find at the back of the casino and up a specifically designed escalator.  There is plenty of room to wait with seating for customers, and we only had to wait for about 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon around 12.  The hostess staff, presumably the same group that ignored our phone calls, were a little unprofessional, preferring to congregate and gossip rather than seat patrons or help in the dining room.  \n\nThe atmosphere in this restaurant is TERRIBLE.  The walls were covered in this industrial metal sheeting, which made it look like a warehouse.  It also amplified the noise in the room, which would have been invasive even without this design flaw.  It is clear that this restaurant is designed to make people feel uncomfortable enough to eat and leave as quickly as possible.  Clearly this worked as no patrons I observed lingered over their ample meals.\n\nWaitstaff was friendly, but service was a little oblivious.  It took 20 minutes to actually receive a bar drink, and I think we saw our waitress three times during the entire experience.  We also lacked silverware.\n\nThe food was pretty good.  The sizes definitely live up to the hype.  I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and it was huge.  The bread was the best part--it was homemade and thickly sliced.  The chicken should have been in smaller chunks, though, and it was a little tough, however, the combination of light mayo and tomatos really did add something to the sandwich.  The side salad had clearly been sitting in the fridge a bit too long and should have been discarded rather than served, but the cucumber dressing was a very refreshing accent.  \n\nThe best entree by far was the fried chicken eggs benedict, which did not disappoint.  It was huge, layered with fried chicken, eggs, fried cheese, biscuits, and mashed potatoes, and topped with chipolte cream sauce.  It was an amazing combination and a huge entree.\n\nThis is definitely worth a visit, but it may not be worth a return."

S"I'd been dying to try the San Diego location since friends keep posting pictures of these giant fancy plates of food from this place. We walked in about 9 am on a Sunday morning. We saw lots of people sitting in the waiting area so we were expecting a wait but luckily the hostess just ushered us in. They have plenty of small tables available for 2- 4 people. Guess there were large groups outside. But by the end of the meal, the place was packed, both inside and out. Anyways, the first thing the waitress said was that the portions are huge. I already knew that and decided to split a dish with someone. The guys each ordered their own dish and ended up boxing up half of it. Hahaha. So I split the house hash with chicken. It was served in a heavy iron skillet along with a biscuit, 2 eggs and fruit. We were starving but it was so much food. The two of us had trouble finishing it. It wasn't that amazing either. The food is just ok. I don't know if I love it or will crave it in the future. It's a little bit greasy. I think their gimmick is just huge portions and I guess their food presentation is pretty good. My friend got the Andy's sage fried chicken eggs benedict (which is a Man vs Food fav) but man it's like almost a foot high, everything piled on top of each other. Looked really good. I only tried a bit of the mashed potatoes and chicken and hollandaise sauce. It was tasty. That dish was like $16 though. Everything is about $15 or more but I guess if it feeds you twice, it's ok. Hard to have leftovers on vacation though and I'm guessing a lot of people that come here are tourists. Oh and the other guy at our table got the combo with a waffle, eggs, sausage, and fruit. The waffle took up like  of the plate and half of the waffle went home with us as well. Haha. Oh and I have to mention service was horrible. Our waitress liked to disappear for long periods of time. She was nice and polite but nowhere to be found. Other people brought out our drinks and food. And we had to flag other wait staff to get an extra plate and boxes at the end. Man, it would've been a much quicker meal if we had better service."

Everything was great, and the price was very reasonable for a place on the Strip. A really great alternative to the buffets.

Well, well worth it.  \n\nThe chicken fried benedict was quite simply the most perfect breakfast imaginable.  My boyfriend, from the South, even said the fried chicken was better than his - HUGE compliment from the most particular eater I have encountered.\n\nOur table of four ordered the chicken fried benedict, French toast, chorizo scramble, Truck Driver breakfast with a vanilla waffle, and a Snickers pancake on the side.  The only complaint was about the vanilla waffle - my sister-in-law was not a fan, but since I did not try it, I am still going with 5 Stars. :)\n\nI am quite the large eater, as is my 6\'5" 300lb brother, and there was food enough for at least three more when we left.  This is definitely going to be a must-stop every time we are in Vegas.  My diet and exercise plan is glad there are not any locations in Phoenix. :)'

I was a bit overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of food we received, but everything was delicious. The atmosphere is quaint and diner-esque, and there were all kinds of people inside, which was really nice.\n\nI had the avocado and bacon scramble with fried potatoes and fresh fruit, and my friend had the chorizo hash. Both dishes were huge, really pretty, and extremely tasty. I sampled some of the hot teas as well. The orange spice was my favorite! It was the perfect blend of sweet and spice. My friend had the house s'mores mocha, and the thing was massive. Massive!  I don't think I've ever seen a mug quite so large. It was fantastic as well, and had tons of ooey gooey marshmallows on top.\n\nI would love to go back and try pancakes or something. I'm sure they are delicious as well.

The only thing that ruined my experience was the rude redheaded host. We asked to be sat in a booth and she refused telling us that she absolutely could not. Now I could understand this if it was packed and busy, but it was 5 AM, and there was plenty of seating, not even half full!  I had to ask to speak to someone else and then we were seated 10 mins later in a booth. What really irritated me even further was that a party of three (same as ours) was seated in the booth in front of us by the redheaded host not even 5 mins later! I'm not sure if she was talked to by her managers. I shouldn't have to argue for a seat in a half empty restaurant.  \n\nI will return again to try some different dishes since the first dish I ordered was delicious. I heard the chicken a waffles are a must here. I hope next time I get a polite host! What good is a restaurant if the food is good and the service is terrible!

My boyfriend ordered it and I ended up eating most of his chicken because it was just so damn tasty.  The mix of herbs they put in there really infuse the chicken and make it taste like a bird that\'s flown in from heaven.  I thought the friend chicken here was inifintely better than Roscoe\'s (I know, blasphemy to some).  \n\nAlso, I usually can\'t eat more than a bite of pancakes.  But...the brown sugar banana pancake is also REALLY REALLY REALLY GOOD here.  The pancake is pizza size, and the entire top is glazed with a crunchy brown sugar coating that pairs great with the pancake beneath.  Yum!\n\nI got some kind of a sausage scramble (can\'t even remember which one) which was not really very great.

But mind you comfort food is code for fat food! I don't recommend if you're on a New Years resolution diet kick.

The chicken was void of any sage flavor. I don't even know what sage is supposed to taste like, but I'm sure this chicken was void of it. It was bland, but, I will admit, it was the best cooked fried chicken I've ever had. Crunchy batter and all moist and sh^t inside. Nothing that a little bit of salt and hot sauce didn't help. The waffles were dense. They'd give Rush Limbaugh a run for his money. And much like Rush, there was bacon inside of the waffles. There's enough food on the plate to feed everyone on the blackjack table. \n\nIt's inside the Imperial Palace casino on the second floor.

I love good corned beef hash, so this place, which was a block away seemed perfect. "Farm fresh with a twist." So I had the Pacers Hash, which was okay...a little bland. But it came out really fast, but was cold. Not cold, cold...but lukewarm...edible, but not right. Michelle had the giant Griddle Cheese Sandwich. Looked delicious with tomatoes and avocados. But the waiter, who had run through a few sides offered with that when we ordered, brought her fries instead of a salad. It was late and we were tired, so Michelle didn\'t point this out and just ate her sandwich. The waiter was a nice guy, very friendly. But he only had two tables and seemed much more concerned with being behind the bar, even though there were no bar customers, than he was with waiting his two tables.

I ordered the quesadilla which had eggs, mashed potatoes, cheese, jalapenos, nacho cheese sauce, and a bunch of other stuff that I couldn't even recognize but it tasted so good. I couldn't finish it all, which makes sense since I believe the restaurant was featured on Man vs Food. Go there expecting to wait at least 15 minutes because it is so popular. The short wait is totally worth it. While waiting, check out all the celebrities who have signed pictures for the restaurant or take a look at the menu on the wall, or even dare I say walk around the restaurant and take a gander at what everyone is eating so you can start salivating."

S"HASH HASH A NO GO!  based on a friend's recommendation, 8 of us trekked to hash hash a go go last Friday morning and at 11 there was an hour wait. once we finally got seated we ordered cocktails, which seemed priced fairly, but they were pretty weak. we finally ordered but waited almost another HOUR for our food to arrive. and when it did, NONE of us liked it. most of us ordered the sage fried chicken which was dry and flavorless. we couldn't even taste any salt. one friend asked for a sauce or something to add moisture to her chicken and 20 min later the waitress brought her some ranch dressing. food and service was horrid. I agree with another reviewer...it should be called HASH HASH A NO NO! or HASH HASH A NO GO!! what a waste of our time and money!"

S"Hash House A Go Go...one of the best values on the Strip! \n\nSpeaking of which, to my surprise there was a HHAGG Location inthe Imperial Palace!!! I was pumped when I found out, cause I was staying next store at the Flamingo! \n\nSo, speaking of the Imperial Palace, I would never step foot in this place if it wasn't for the HHAGG. I didn't know what to expect when I heard the restaurant was in this hotel. \n\nBut........ \n\nBoy was I surprised! HHAGG was a Gem in the hotel. What a awesome job with the restaurant! Very pleased. \n\nImportant!!! Please READ! \nBreakfast from like 830 am-11am was rocking! Anywhere from 30min to an hour wait! We stopped back around 11:30/11:45 and we were seated right away and I was able to get breakfast food still (limited menu) \n\nI ended up getting the The Tractor Driver Combo \nTwo Eggs w/ bacon sausage or potatoes with 1 HH signature flapjack. Make it a waffle or french toast for a buck. $13.95 \nAme some value!! I will be back again!"

If you are daring like me try to eat the main dish by yourself. This place serves breakfasts all day so that's a plus. I ordered the fried chicken benedict...bomb. The chicken is crispy. The eggs is fluffy. Mash potato is delicious. Bacon...chipotle sauce and cheese. Mmm mmm good\nThe service was excellent. Made my visit even better. Our waiter was very friendly and quick."

S"This restaurant is located inside the Imperial Palace.   Based on that fact, I totally didn't expect this place to be as awesome as it turned out to be.  My friends and I only tried this place out because my bf's sister (a major foodie) said that they had a good breakfast selection.  \n\nThe bf and I shared:\n\n- Fresh Market Tomato Salad: If you're gonna try a salad, try this one.  What won me over was the griddled crispy Parmesan cheese that topped the salad.  It was soo goood.\n\n- NY Times Sage Fried Chicken & Bacon Waffle Tower:  Okay, this is seriously something you HAVE to try when coming here.  There's BACON in the waffles.  Crispy fried chicken is so perfectly crispy.  Then there's the leek on top?!!  I loved it.  I personally didn't like to combine the two but I also didn't mind eating it side by side.  What can be wrong about fried chicken??? And there's definitely nothing wrong with waffles.  The two make a very nice couple.\n\nI was also able to try one of my friends':\n\n- Stuffed Burgers (you get to choose from about 3 different stuffings - he tried mashed potato, bacon, and cheddar cheese): I thought the burger was okay...it was a little bit on the dry side but all in all, I like the combination of flavors in the 1 pounder.  \n\nThe service was decent.  We liked our waiter.  He knew the right times to come by.  I like the atmosphere.  Very diner like.  Apparently a lot of famous people come here so you can check out their wall of fame, which is pretty cool.\n\n\nThe hotel itself is so sucky but I guess not horrible.  The place reaks and I wouldn't stay here again (was here for the cheap prices haha).  BUT do come here for this restaurant :)"

S"In Vegas, wherever you can find cheap and large portion places is filled with people. we arrived this breakfast place on a Saturday noon around 11am, and the wait line is about 1 hour and 15 min long for two people. Well, I guess people here have nothing else to do, so the wait is tolerable. \n\nSince there is no where else you can find easy meal, we decided to wait. The restaurant is actually pretty big. A lot of people. Serve is fast though. The food took about 20-25 min to arrive, so that part was not too bad. But the food itself was not that great.\n\nWe had a mojito, which was pretty strong and tasty. The food indeed came in huge portion, but the taste wasn't that great. We tried the french toast, which was lack much flavor except for the sweetness from the syrup. And my omelette with mushroom was very plain as well. Not taste of the egg. And the potato on the side was not crispy and not so great. The only highlight was their homemade strawberry jam and whipped butter. Those help the plain food to be more tasty.\n\nThis is Vegas. Line up for the not so great food only for the big portion and cheap price."

S"Not as good as their flagship out on Sahara, but this one's right on the strip, although with the renovation you have to wade thru some dust and scaffolding to get here. The portions were just as monstrously large though, and this time we split 2 dishes among the three of us lightweights, and we left full having not even finished either of them. I'd have picked the chicken and waffles for sure but democracy won out. Here we tried the chorizo skillet and the Tractor Driver Combo. The chorizo skillet was good, although the one tortilla it comes with is inadequate for the amount of filling it comes with. The tractor driver combo we upgraded to a banana pancake which was well worth the extra dollar. Service was excellent. \n\nThe experience at their standalone restaurant on Sahara was better in terms of the atmosphere, the food, and the overall experience, but this was still fine."

Ive been wanting to try this place and I'm glad that I did but I don't think I will make this a regular stop on every trip to Vegas.\n\nBe prepared to wait in line and get the standard generic service due to the number of people being served, but that's standard when trying to eat on the strip."

S"Every time I visit Las Vegas I always make sure to make a special trip here. Absolutely love this place. This is great for the person who loves breakfast food no matter what time of a day it is. The Corn Beef and Hash is my all time favorite. They give you a large portion of corn beef with potatoes two eggs (style of your choosing) and a biscuit. The corn beef is never extremely greasy the way a lot of other places make theirs. It's always delicious.  \n\nAnother one of my favorites is the banana pancake. It's a giant pancake with bananas cooked into it as a posed to just sitting on top. Also very delicious and a great size for sharing. \n\nMy only negative is that during some parts of the day there is a long wait and the last time I went two employees were arguing in from of the hostess station (a little unprofessional). But these has never stopped me from going. I would suggest going very early in the morning or late at night for their late night menu. \n\nI always have a positive experience when coming here. Highly recommend this place!!!"

S"This place is just... okay. Hence, the three star rating. First, the food comes in absolutely ridiculous portions, which are great for the price. However, you will come to realize that you probably won't even be able to eat half of your meal. I had the snickers flapjacks, which were good but soooo sweet, I had to order a side of bacon just to counteract the sweetness with some salt (I also love sweets, so it takes a lot for me to think something is TOO sweet). My boyfriend had the meatloaf hash, which we both thought was really delicious. We also ordered some speciality coffees, the smores mocha, and another mocha-type drink I can't remember the name of. Both were good, but didn't come out of the kitchen until we were almost done our meals. This brings me to the pretty bad service. Our waiter was nice, but he was soooo slow and maybe checked on us once the entire time we were there. Although - he did seem to be serving his other tables just fine. Overall, the food is okay/good and the service is blaaah."

The biscuits were good but not anything I couldn't have gotten from KFC. Mashed potatoes were meh, whatever. And the chicken was just meh too, neither crispy nor soggy - a weird in between and flavor wasn't bland it was just again, whatever.\n\nI also got the pistachio mocha, which at first tasted soooo bitter!!! But once I stirred everything together it was quite delightful and had a hint of pistachio flavor, which I loved especially cause I'd never had anything like it. \n\nPrice: A\nPotion: A+\nService: A\nAtmosphere: B\nTaste: B-/ C"

S'So disappointing!!! Came in because I heard great things, read awesome yelp reviews, and the menu online was enticing. We had monorail passes so getting there was easy. My husband and I both decided on the hash since it\'s what they\'re famous for. I\'m a foodie and almost always order what a place is known for.... it\'s supposed to be the best choice, right? WRONG! First of all, the hash is not a hash, beware hash lovers. It is large chopped crispy potatoes with stuff on top. I got the corned beef hash, and it was literally breakfast potatoes with shredded beef on top. I was hoping for the delish smushy goodness of everything cooked together in a hash.. and it totally fell short. It was also served in a cast iron skillet that it wasn\'t even cooked in. What I really wanted was their vegetable "hash" with corned beef added to it. But they wouldn\'t let me... which I found strange. They said I could remove things but couldn\'t add anything. I didn\'t care if it cost more, I just wanted veggies with my hash. But nope. I also ordered they\'re "famous" blt bloody mary which also fell short. It was watery from the first sip, and I really didnt understand the giant lettuce and tomato in it. To top it off my hash arrived incorrect, 3 times. The poached egg, although cooked in water, was cooked to a rock. It came with a biscuit when I asked for unbuttered toast. And then the toast arrived with butter. I\'m allergic to dairy so there really wasn\'t any ignoring it... The server asked to take it back again but my husband\'s would have gotten cold.\n\nThe two stars are for the glass that I got to keep from my drink and for the server taking my meal off the check. Unfortunately, I don\'t understand the hype this place gets and I won\'t be coming back...'

It was BLAND. Even after adding an exorbitant amount of salt, it still was just blah.  The potatoes were fine, but OraIda at home would have been just as good.\n\nThe people I was with got the fried chicken and waffles.  The chicken was very bland, as well.

We finally got a seat and were very excited to sit down and enjoy a fabulous breakfast.  \n\nFood was just ok.  We got the fried chicken/mashed potatoes/egg combo (forgot what it was called) and a Chorizo skillet.  The skillet was far better than the other dish and this surprised me.  The order on the eggs was wrong (brought scrambled-- ordered over medium) and we waited almost until the end of our meal for this to be corrected.  We also had bloody marys and they were also just ok. \n\nThis place is fun; presentation of food is unique and I think it is better than most places for breakfast, but I think Vegas is full of overrated places like these.'

Bring your appetite, stretchy pants and be prepared to EAT. \nTheir veggie hash is one of my favorites but this time I got the brown sugar and banana pancake.

S'Here we go with another superfluous review of Hash House a Go Go.  We all know it, it looks like most of us love it.\n\nI seriously thought I was going to die during my wait for a table at Hash House.  My weekend in Vegas was coming to a close, and none too soon.  I killed more brain cells than I want to consider, and I was so ill from overconsumption that I could hardly sit up without battling the urge to hurl.  It was gnarly, at best.  I am so glad I waited, because Hash House magically cured me.\n\nTake my advice - if you had some errors in judgment during your Saturday night in Vegas, spend your Sunday morning by trekking to the Imperial Palace, wading through the smoke and celebrity impersonators, and taking the escalator to Hash House a Go Go.  Order a coke, and pick a skillet.  I suggest the chorizo.  Devour it.  Then go blow $50 in the penny slots and consume a hair of the dog that bit you.  All will be right in the universe again, trust me.'

The television show spotlights local hot-spots, clubs, restaurants, etc.  The first time I saw them on television, the portions were huge (think Cheesecake Factory) and the food looked absolutely delicious.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to visit the eatery until my next visit to Vegas.\n\nMy friend and fellow foodie were dead set on having Hash House for Sunday breakfast before he had to hit the road.  As we made our way to Imperial Palace, I was already drunk an it was only 10 or 11 in the morning.  After parking in the garage, we made our way into the casino and after asking some staff for directions, we made our way towards Hash House.\n\nI was pleasantly surprise that there was no waiting time for our party of two.  After a few more shots, I glanced over the extensive menu and settled for my guilty pleasure of french toast.  My fried ordered some variation of eggs Benedict.  The food took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table and we were both with smiles.\n\nThe french toast arrive an were beautifully presented and resemble a presentation from the Food Network.  The french toast were dense, yet fluffy and were nicely griddled to a golden brown and dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  The french toast were mouth watering and undoubtedly the best tasting french toast I've ever had.  In addition to the fluffy toast, caramelized banana slices accompanied the delicious toast.\n\nHash House A Go Go is a food experience that will forever be embedded in my mind and taste buds.  My friend's breakfast was equally up to par and gave him an equally satisfying food coma.  If I had to compare Hash House A Go Go to something it would be The Cheesecake Factory, but more intimate and with a mom and pop diner feel.  Oh Hash House A Go Go, how I miss you."

Having just watched Man vs Food and seeing this place I figured what the hell, let\'s try it out. Looking at the prices for lunch I knew it would be a gamble, but this is Vegas, so let\'s bet it all!\n\nI was by myself so I sat at the bar and was serviced by a pleasant enough spikey hair lady behind the bar. No problems here.\n\nI ordered the chicken and waffles because that\'s their "specialty" and it should fill me up from about 11am til dinnertime.\n\nIt arrived quickly in all its visual majesty. It really is an impressive tower. Check out my pic, it\'s like #250 in the yelp list. Four large waffles topped by a 4 giant pieces of fried chicken. This is going to be awesome I said to myself.\n\nThen, I started eating some of it, and my joy turned to sorrow. Sadly, the fried chicken had no flavor. I don\'t think I\'ve ever had flavorless fried chicken, but this place somehow pulled it off.\n\nNext, the waffles. There too was a I disappointed. They were really bready and had none of that malty waffle goodness. I had to ask for more syrup just to make the whole thing edible.\n\nYes, it is a gigantic amount of food, but for $16, it better look AND taste good, and this wasn\'t the case.

S"My favorite kind of restaurant is one that takes something familiar and pumps up the flavor profile in a unique way, while still keeping the vibe casual and comfortable. Chego in Los Angeles is my favorite restaurant in the world for this reason, and what it does for Korean food, Hash House A Go Go does for breakfast staples.\n\nTake whatever it is you enjoy for breakfast. They have a fresh twist on it that adds lots more flavor, and they give you a gigantic portion too. I got the corned beef hash - it came out with larger chunks of quality corned beef (instead of mushed together scraps), with swiss cheese to make it a combination of the usual breakfast staple with a Reuben twist. My wife got the Pecan blueberry pancake, and said it was the best pancake she's ever had.\n\nHighest recommendation to go. I find it hard to believe a human being could walk away from here unhappy. One tip though - this location is at the Imperial Palace, so we went because it was on the strip. But if you have a car, or the means to get off the strip, go to another location if you can. The Imperial Palace is one of the more crowded, smoky, noisy, run down and depressing hotels you'll visit. The restaurant is still worth the trip if this is your only option (heck, I did it myself), but knowing better next time, I'll make the drive to the other location."

The fact that we didn't have to travel off the strip to eat at it, was even better.\n\nWe made the epic trip down the strip to find this location. There seemed to be a huge lineup of people waiting for tables but we were told around 40 minutes for a table of 4. You're given your little buzzer (that doesn't work down on the casino floor) and then you wait. They both scream out your name and collect your buzzer, and if you're not there when they do so, off the list you go. Our wait was around that time but when it's 2pm and this is your breakfast, that time seems like an eternity.\n\nService was quite sparse, though our waiter was very nice. We placed our order for drinks and two came out right away, and the other two (bar beverages) took about 15 minutes. 15 minutes for a bottled beer and a margarita. Then we waited for our food and it must have taken close to an hour. The menu says that it make take a little while but after the wait for the table, this was a lot.\n\nI got a burger, stuffed with mushrooms and cheese, and a side salad. The burgers are huge and very messy to eat. Have lots of napkins! The meat isn't seasoned and so really it's just a very big average burger. The dressing on the salad was delicious and I think that was my favorite part of the meal.\n\nThe other meals at the table were fine but nothing was seasoned very well and it was all kinda meh. Portions are unnecessarily huge and they'll gladly box your leftovers up for you. Again, it took a long time for the bill to come and so by the time we left, it was after 4pm.\n\nIf you want to feed a family of 4 with one plate of food, this is your place. Prices are very reasonable but try to hit them at a slow time and be prepared to wait a long time for your food."

S"So our first stop was Hash House A Go Go, as seen on both Food Network (Chefs Vs. City) and Travel Channel (Man vs. Food and Food Paradise). We got the Sage fried Chicken and waffles. Just so we're clear, I totally forgot about this, but bacon is cooked into the waffle. I repeat the bacon is in the waffle. Four waffles piled on each other, with two pieces of fried chicken at the top skewered by a stick of sage, covered with fried leeks and drizzled with maple syrup (Don't worry syrup lovers, they also give you a little dish of more syrup). Fried Chicken and Waffles are my jam, I don't like eggs so I don't have a lot of breakfast foods I do like, but this combines the best of not just both worlds, but all worlds. The chicken was moist and juice, had a fantastic crisp noise when you broke into it. And the waffles, crisp enough with slabs of bacon just hanging out. All combined with maple syrup and you have a winning combination. We heeded many warnings and split it between two of us. Because of that we also allowed ourselves a side of crispy potatoes, which were good, just paled in comparison to whatever else we had going on on our tastebuds. It was all very intense, we got there around 9, just missing massive crowds, and we didn't eat again until dinner."

We enjoyed our breakfasts, I had eggs, bacon and a huge pancake, hubby had an enormous ham and cheese omelet. The only bummer was that they were out of the tea I wanted so I ordered coffee then found out they don't have non-dairy creamer, boo, what about lactose intolerant people? It was pricey ($40 for 2 of us for breakfast) but I would go back."

My food was fair, but so salty I thought I was going to commit suicide before I could find water on the way back to our hotel.

I do add more syrup on my chicken cause the seasoning batter is a little bland for me. \n\nToday I ordered the Sage Fried chicken & waffles.

S'In the land of the dinosaurs, or at least those of us who eat like one, Hash House would probably reign supreme. This city is overflowing with buffets designed to make your waist, well, overflow, and Hash House can easily provide that feeling with a single item. The fact that very few things on their menu even exceed the $15 mark is pretty impressive, but maybe that\'s why everything presented looks ostentatious but winds up just rather banal... an embodiment of Las Vegas as a whole, perhaps.\n\nStyle over substance certainly seems to be the modus operandi for Hash House, delivering mammoth sized meals you can\'t help but go "wow!" over, and yet very few people leave with empty plates, more likely because they simply got tired of eating surprisingly bland food, rather than being simply outmatched in the stomach capacity department. I watched multiple diners get up from the bar stools next to me leaving half or even three-quarters of a plate full of food behind. I guess when the prices are this low, in Vegas, you figure that the minimal investment isn\'t really worth the excessive calories.\n\nThat\'s all in retrospect though... I came to Hash House because I had heard tales of monolithic food combinations so loaded with flavor that they had attracted multiple food related television shows to their establishments, including a chicken and waffle dish stacked so high that it approached eye level. Without going on too much of a rant about how these shows often lead so many people astray, I\'ll just say that the size (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w#vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w) is definitely impressive, but we all know it\'s what you do with it that counts. Somewhat ironically I had actually used their sage fried chicken and bacon loaded waffles as inspiration for a recent brunch party I hosted, and I can honestly say that I put Hash House to shame. What absolutely makes fried chicken is the skin, and if you\'ve got limp, soggy skin, then your size doesn\'t much matter. This chicken could have been baked for all I know, as there was zero crispness to it. Add to that waffles that, aside from the bacon slices inside, are generally bland, and one tiny ramekin of syrup to assist, and I can see why people literally just got tired of eating this. \n\nI also gave their BLT Bloody Mary a try, thinking the ingredients would be well infused into the drink, considering that it was by far the most expensive on the menu, but instead I wound up with what essentially amounts to a sandwich shoved into a drink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1YBxkLrZg652xt2KR5g?select=vdzuQYUETEvJLxak4rwB2w#SBNu2x4ogGJkvRJ5spQLRA), with no clear way on the best way to either eat or drink it. I wound up having to sip and nibble like a freaking rabbit on what has to be the clumsiest cocktail idea I\'ve ever seen executed. After having the variations prepared by Brian, Nicole, and Gregg at my Bloody Mary Battle, this seemed outright amateurish. I should have stuck with my original intuition, passed on the alcohol, and gave the S\'Mores latte a go... although if this was any indication it would have been the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man shoved into a teacup with a box of Graham Crackers on the side and someone who comes along and projectile vomits Hershey\'s chocolate syrup in my face.'

S"Most people prefer to eat the buffets in Vegas. Some of us though prefer to try popular restaurants around the area instead. So one drunk morning me and the party decide to go to Hash A Go Go a popular place that has been mention by our friends. \n\nLocation: \nImperial Palace \n\nWait Time: \nwas about 30-45 mins depending on the time you arrived. \n\nRestroom: \nDownstaris in the Casino\n\nFood: \nEach plate is large enough to be share by two people, however if you do share there is a $3 charge for a extra empty plate or something like that. \n\nAndy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict w/maple reduction ($15.95) \n\nIts noted that this is Mans vs Foods Favorite meal for those who don't know is Adam Richman who goes around and try to find the best grub in the world. \n\nBiscuit: \nthe bottom layer of the entree, was fluffy and buttery \nFried Chicken: \nNot crispy enough to my liking perhaps the gravy made it soggy before it reached the table. \nBacon: \nWas not crispy yet again to my liking, was a bit soft. \nBenedict Eggs: \nEggs with green/red/yellow peppers and cheese. It was soft and gooey \nGravy: \nI believe they added too much corn starch to the gravy it was thick and bland. \nMash Potatoes:\nvery hefty serving of bland and not enough buttered potatoes. \n\nBacon Waffle: ($10.95) \n4 huge slices of Waffles w/bacon literally inside of it. The waffle had too much flour in it. There is also chipotle seasoning on the bottom. Do not order the waffle! \n\nHash House Cobb Salad: ($13.95) \nThis must be a family size salad that has smoked chicken,smokedwood bacon, tomato,red onion,blue cheese dressing and BBQ sauce but its on the trim of the plate for garnishing. This was probably the best of the 3 that we order."

The pieces of fried chicken was huge and delicious! If it was just the fried chicken, I would still think it is absolutely amazing. Very flavorful. There was fried mozzarella cheese on it... I love fried cheese. They thought of everything! There is some spinach and some tomatoes that compliments the dish very well. The bacon is crunchy and the creamy chipotle sauce on it was outstanding!!\n\nI would say that the only disappointment was that they use scramble eggs instead of poached eggs. My girlfriend had a dish with roasted chicken in it.. not good at all. She didn't even finish it, and didn't even eat it as leftovers afterwards. \n\ngo here... get the sage fried chicken eggs benedict; you will thank me"

None of us were happy with our food.  The scramble came with fried potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit.  The potatoes were cooked well but, like most of the food we received, was bland.  The biscuit was somewhat dry and had no butter, gravy, or even jam. The scramble itself was quite runny wich was very odd and still fairly bland.  \nMy friend's waffles had bacon in then and were OK. The fried chicken however had a heavy sage smell which overpowered everything else about it. Had no flavor beyond that. \nThe pancake my other friend got was just a big pancake. Nothing special.

It was amazing. First of all, it was huge. It had a large piece of delicious fried chicken on top of eggs, biscuits and mashed potatoes. It was all topped off with a gravy that had some zip to it. The biscuits were obviously home-made and absolutely light and fluffy. The gravy was a perfect compliment instead of traditional hollandaise.\n\nMy companion had the egg skillet with Chorizo sausage and got a tortilla in lieu of a biscuit. Right choice. It was a great meal - wrapping up eggs, chorizo and potatoes in a home-made tortilla. Again, very delicious.\n\nMy companion also had a BLT bloody mary....which is a bloody mary with bacon, tomato, lettuce and a slice of toast coming out of it. It was tasty, but probably not worth the price. May just want to stick with a traditional bloody mary.\n\nWait was 25 minutes when we arrived around 11am on a Friday. We sat at the bar so we didn't have a wait, but it appeared they turned tables pretty quickly. Staff was very friendly and helpful, making recommendations and suggestions.\n\nMenu was extensive and offered a lot of options, with some very interesting and clever combinations of foods. I wanted about 10 different things off the menu.\n\nI can't comment on the poor reviews, especially for lunch/dinner items, but I think the breakfast is out of this world."

Now we have been told of the plate charge @ other restaurants which usually means the kitchen portions it out on another plate for you and we just decline that & they forego the charge but not here. But the waiter did suggest how we might as well order a side dish so we are actually getting something for our $2.50 plate charge. We ordered more bacon of course!! I think that was $3.50 but still, it was all well worth it. I ordered tThey were AMAZING!!!! We ate two & took the other two back to our room where we had it the next a.m. as we were getting ready to head out. (we had a microwave). The coffee was great as was the service! The only complaint i have is the hostess. When she gave us the little pager thing, I told her I had to use the restroom. She told me where it was (downstairs) and I asked if the pager would work that far...she said "yes" so downstairs we went. Don\'t worry, the bf held the pager for me so I didn\'t take it n the bathroom (though I\'m sure there are people who do). We got a message on it saying the pager wasn\'t receiving messages. We had to go back upstairs to get it reset. We still had about 30 mins of a wait so we went downstairs again, but not as far as the bathrooms, to play a few slots & got the same message.

Feeling a little hung over after a long night on the strip, i stopped in to get something hearty and delicious for breakfast this morning and Hash House was an easy choice.  When i looked at the menu I was a bit overwhelmed, as everything looked good.  This is where this excellent service came in to play.  After alerting my server, Sarah, to my dilemma she was able to suggest the perfect breakfast and experience.  She suggested I start with a peppercorn vodka bloody mary as an appetizer, which was ideal for my situation.  It was a total clutch move, Sarah is clearly a pro.  And when it came to my other beverages, my coffee and water were never empty as the service was very attentive.  For my main dish, Sarah suggested the Chorizo Hash, which was perfect.  It was also huge, and I only got through about half.  We ended up bagging up the remainder and I was assured the hash would make for an excellent left over meal.  Sarah was so in point with her suggestions, attitude and attentivness, I was happy and knew that I would be well taken care of everytime I saw her awesome red hair and smile come from around the corner.

S'We went here for dinner after some recommendations from some friends. It is buried a few floors down in the Quad, which can be a little bit of a pain to get to due to construction. We were told there was a wait to be seated, but when we looked in the restaurant, there were open tables everywhere. We were told that they were short staffed, but then he seated us quickly after that. For being short staffed, the service was totally acceptable. Drinks are moderately priced (for vegas at least). We all ordered different items: the swordfish, salmon, butternut squash/risotto, duck breasts, and the crispy pork (I think?). Pretty much everyone at the table was pleased with their food, and the portions are enormous. I thought it was one of the best deals on the strip, paying 18.95 for a good fresh meal over bland/overpriced room service or some bad buffet. \n\nAll in all, if you want a fair priced HUGE meal, its a great place. I will be back on future vegas trips for sure. Their breakfast looked amazing, btw.'

S'To say that the dishes here are gargantuan in size is an understatement.  They give you enough food to feed half of China. Having a location right on the Strip is a big plus.  The fried chicken with bacon waffles and fried chicken eggs benedict always remains a favorite.  \n\nEven though the food is decent, the wait is horrendous.  Plan about an hour to an hour  and half.  They give you the pagers but they dont work in the casino area - sucks!  The sheer volume of people that come through here has a huge impact on kitchen staff as food service is excruciatingly slow.  One of the dishes we ordered was the fried salmon sandwich and it came out 30 min after the chicken.  How does it take longer to fry fish than chicken?  The wait staff came by to check on us often and let us know that the fish would be coming out in 5 min. They must be on Spanish time cuz it took 30 min and we had to take it to go.  The person who ordered that was nonetheless very displeased since everyone else was done with their entrees before it came out. I dont think HH should levy split plate charges since it would help them out a lot to have less entrees ordered.\n\nFor a better experience, although a bit out of the way, I recommend going to the location off of the strip.'

S"We went here and were almost scared away by the line but it moves really, really quickly.\n\nI got the chicken and waffles and they were pretty good but it's a boneless chicken breast which is never the best choice to fry because it comes out dry, which this one was. The sage was detectable and the bacon waffles were very good.\n\nMy buddy ordered the banana brown sugar pancake and it was GREAT! I would have probably liked my meal better if I hadn't tried his. Although they're known for their chicken and waffle meal the banana pancake is huge (think pizza sized) and decadently delicious.\n\nA great value and a very filling and tasty meal."

S"Came here at 5am Sunday morning.  I counted maybe 15 parties.  I counted 5 servers.  I've never worked in food service but 3 tables per server should count as easy, right?  But for whatever reason, our server kept disappearing for long periods of time.  During our meal, the server did swing by once to apologize and explained that they are very busy.  Hmm, not very convincing with the majority of the tables empty.\n\nTwo of us had burgers, which we both agreed tasted very, very bland.  Needed ketchup for it to be edible but conveniently enough, the ketchup bottle at our table was completely empty.  Since our waiter was nowhere to be seen, I had to go snatch a bottle from an empty table.  For my order, I opted for a salad rather than the usual french fries.  The server did not ask what dressing I would like, and the salad was given to me without dressing.  When I realized this, the waiter had already disappeared and I was not given an opportunity to ask him for dressing until 30 minutes later.  I asked for ranch but he gave me cucumber ranch.  Whatever.\n\nAnother friend had ordered the steak (cooked medium) and eggs special, the steak came out well done and very tough.\n\nIn conclusion, bad service and bad food.  This place should just close down."

S'Everything the world needs to know about us fat Americans can be found at the Hash House A Go Go.  Vegas is a city of sin and this is Gluttony at it\'s finest.  Hash House describes their concept as Twisted Farm Food.  It\'s American comfort food taken out of it\'s overalls and dressed up.  I came here for one thing.....The Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  I saw it on Man vs Food and knew someday it would have to be mine.\n\nSo many times when a place "creates" a tower of food all combined together on a gargantuan plate, it\'s not well thought out.  This is different and the key here is each ingredient is great on it\'s own.  From the bottom up we have mashed potatoes, nicely seasoned and thrown on a griddle to get them slightly browned.  Then why stop with one starch when you can have two?  The mashed potatoes are topped with a couple of fluffy buttermilk biscuits that are some of the most tasty I\'ve ever had.  Followed by fresh spinach (it\'s great that they don\'t cook it so it doesn\'t get mushy) and slices of Red Beefsteak Tomato.  This is topped with a couple of slices of hickory smoked bacon and then it\'s namesake....A half pound well seasoned fried chicken breast.  Corn flakes are used as the batter and it keeps it\'s crunch well.  Top this with scrambled eggs and cheese.  The cheese is fried up on the griddle so it\'s melted prior to going on everything else.  This also creates a nice browned skin to the melted cheese.  I forgot to ask what cheese they were using, but it wasn\'t too strong.  It seemed it\'s main job was bond itself to the chipotle cream sauce that is poured on top and create one cheesy gooey chipotle sauce that seals everything in.  Winner Winner Chicken Dinner!  I hope they never open a Hash House near me because I could see myself craving one of these life ending creations often.  5 Stars all the way.\nThe masterpiece... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#4MG6MmBLXIl1kwp_ucw3kg\n\nAnd here\'s a nice cross section of it to fully appreciate all it\'s glory...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#50iLIS2poMhauloTh8so2w\n\nI also got a chance to try the Big O\' Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin Sandwich.  We all agreed while impressive to look at, it wasn\'t on the same level as Sage Fried Chicken Benedict.  It was a tasty deep fried pork cutlet but I found it needing more than just the sprinkling of ketchup on it as it got a little dry.  I did love the pickles as the vinegar flavor worked well with the pork.  Perhaps some kind of creamy BBQ sauce would have been better.  The bun was a whole wheat bun, but was a throw away here.  Why whole wheat?  I have no idea.  3.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#sMJihbRjw3f9nOLeumyMPQ\n\nMy wife for some reason got the most boring burger on the menu.  As such I found myself saying....just a burger.  Their burgers are two half pound patties stuffed with a few different options.  Well it doesn\'t seem that they are really "stuffed" just things are put between the 2 burgers.  She got bacon, cheddar, and avocado.  So to me it was just how they layered everything, big deal the bacon, cheddar, and avocado was between two separate patties.  There was also no sauce?  Just ketchup.  We asked for some mayo, so it wasn\'t so dry, but this place should really come up with their own sauce.  If you want a burger, there are better more creative options in Vegas, such as Burger Bar or Bachi Burger.  3.5 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#hjjZMDOZjlfQE0GSgrp17A\n\nI\'m sure there are other 5 star dishes here as I saw a lot of amazing looking things.  My daughter\'s plain pancake was one of the best I\'ve ever tasted.  They do them all kinds of ways here.  Of course the pancake was the size of a medium pizza and a good 3/4 inch thick.  For sure I\'m trying one of their hash dishes next time.  After all they are called Hash House.  The Meatloaf and Smoked Mozzarella Hash sounds great with a couple of over easy eggs on top.  I can recommend the banana latte.  It was excellent. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8oW8c6E4IWay0MhURzQn_Q#V1jbFFDhdWldAaGeyBHHWg\n\nExpect at least a 20-30 minute wait as the word is out on this place.  They told us 45, but we were in in 20.  It\'s a huge restaurant and they move them in and out fairly well.  Open 24 hours!!!!'

S"Went to the one in Vegas at like 4 AM and had really high expectations for this place. I prefer breakfast food over lunch food so I was really excited to try it especially with it being featured on the Food Network. My friend and I split the corned beef hash and it came out and wasn't what I imagined corned beef hash to be! There were chunks of meat instead of slices of meat and it didn't look appetizing at all. It also didn't taste good! The portion is huge so maybe that's why a lot of people really like it. \n\nWould never go back here again."

S'Totally forgot to review Hash House A Go Go. This restaurant is A-MAZ-ING especially the infamous chicken and waffles. What drew us to this mouth watering place were: \n\n1) Adam Richman did the fried chicken eggs benedict challenge here (http://www.travelchannel.com/video/fried-chicken-eggs-benedict-12437) \n2) Highly rated on Yelp \n3) Recommended by a BM. All those factored combined, we HAD to trek our way over and taste it ourselves. \n\nThe portions here are HUGE. You have been warned. We had 7 people and we shared two entrees and one side: \n\nSage Fried Chicken and Bacon Waffle - One of THE best chicken and waffles I ever had. The chicken was moist, tender, packed full of juice and flavor while the waffle was drizzled with maple syrup and bacon BAKED inside! It was a good balance between sweet and savory. LOVE THIS DISH! As Jimmy McMillian says \'The Rent is Too Damn High\', this dish is \'Too Damn Good"!! :) You will not go wrong with this staple meal. Just thinking about it makes my tummy grumble :(\n\nOriginal Eggs Benedict - served with some fruits on the side. Tasty but not memorable. I would have gotten the Adam Richman\'s challenge! *drool*\n\nCorn Beef Hash - with potatoes, scrabble eggs and swiss cheese. The potatoes were my fav in this dish, nom nom nom. \n\nThis place is definitely worth a trip out to try if you\'re ever in Las Vegas. Oh, and it\'s now open 24 hours :O genius marketing/business strategy!! But just be warned, The Quad was doing renovations so it was like a maze to get to.'

My husband ordered 3 egg breakfast with sausage and scrambled eggs. They brought him 1 1/2 eggs and the breakfast fries were cremated. He couldn't eat them. I ordered the upside down chicken pot pie. I'm not sure who invented this but they should lose the recipe. It was beautifully presented but it was awful. It was served in a thick hard cracker. The filling had no salt and was so bland. I ate the chicken out of it.\n\nI saw the french toast and the eggs benedict. They looked really good. I don't know if we miss ordered or all the food is bad.\n\nThe restaurant is beautiful and easy to get to in the hotel. I will give it one more try, as I always give a place two tries.

This is a super basic dish and I picked this because everything else looked really intense and they still managed to serve me something that I can make better myself. \n\nSage fried chicken - dried chicken, it also tasted kind of sweet. Gross. \n\nOriginal hash Benedict - loads of food but also meh. The bacon tasted like pork rinds. \n\nBanana pancake - this thing is huge!

S"I love this place for breakfast!  Haven't had any other meal here but I'm sure it's just as good as the breakfast since there's always a pretty long wait no matter what time you come!\n\nThe food definitely deserves five stars but I'm rating the entire experience so I have to knock off a star for service.  I think you're pretty safe to order just about anything on the menu and it will be wonderfully satisfying.  To me, the Hand Hammered Port Tenderloin is the absolute best choice and I've ordered it just about every time we've been here!  I take the liberty of sampling everybody else's choices though so I've eaten quite a few menu items.  No matter what I order though, I'll make sure it comes with the mashed potatoes because I tell you what, those are the absolute best!\n\nService however isn't the greatest.  It's sort of slow and sometimes really really hard to get!  It's always packed and I understand they are busy but maybe management needs to have a few more workers on the floor that can actually help the diners.  There were four workers cleaning tables and sweeping the floor that couldn't even fill our water glasses!  The servers are also pretty territorial and really won't help unless you're in their section.  That being said, they are all super friendly and smile a lot so it kind of makes you not realize you're not being helped!  It's definitely not bad enough to make me ever say I won't return, it's just not that great and people should know what to expect so I'm throwing it out there!\n\nMake sure you are hungry when you arrive and don't drink too much either because the portions are enormous!!  I'd say share an entree with somebody else but darn it, then you wouldn't get to sample more of their great cuisine!"

S"Stayed at The Linq Hotel this past weekend during their official re-opening (formerly The Quad hotel) for my friend's Halloween Bachelorette Weekend...while my hotel stay was awful, Hash House A Go Go was probably the best part of my stay at The Linq! lol\n\nAfter returning to my room from a night out and realizing that I was STARVING, I decided to head down to the lobby around 4am and see what was open and order food to bring back to the room. I was thrilled to see that the restaurant was open 24hrs and was directed to the bar to place my take out order. The restaurant itself didn't seem super large but had a cool, comfortable and casual vibe. \n\nThe late night menu wasn't extensive, but it had just what I was in the mood for...Steak & Eggs! For about $15, the special came with a boneless Rib-Eye steak, Scrambled Eggs, Mashed Potatoes & Biscuit. I also ordered an Orange Jc which came out to like $6! If I had known, I probably would've skipped the juice. The wait was a bit long for my order, but when it arrived I remembered to ask for butter & A-1 sauce for my steak before I returned to my room to dive into my food. \n\nOf course I wasn't expecting the plating to be as beautiful as the pictures I've seen for the regular dishes served in the restaurant (lol), but when I opened my take out container I was NOT expecting that much food!!! LOL The portions are HUGE! Two people could've easily shared the meal for sure. \n\nFirst of all, my steak was perfectly cooked, flavorful and SO delicious. The scrambled eggs were large, fluffy folds and were really good. The mashed potatotes were thick, well seasoned, tasty and could probably feed an army. And the best thing next to the steak was the biscuit. The biscuit was BIG! It was soft and slightly doughy in the middle (but in a good way!)...it was so perfect with the whipped butter! I was in heaven and really glad that no one could witness me eating this amazing meal in my hotel bed! \n\nLooking forward to returning here and actually dining in the restaurant!"

And there is no way on earth any mere mortal can finish a Hash House A Go Go portion. The Husband ate about a quarter (and that's being generous) of his chicken and waffles. I ate about an eighth of a meatloaf sandwich that would feed a small Bavarian village. I mean, I required a small crane to lift the thing. My jaw snapped trying to get an actual bite. \n\nThe food is tasty comfort food, served large and proud. It's not haut cuisine, but they do enough inventive things with it to make it memorable for more than just size. I kept purloining The Husband's waffles and dipping them in whatever sauce they served it with. \n\nThey will charge some kind of surcharge if you share a plate, but you probably shouldn't let that stop you if you think you can both settle on a dish to share.

S'I don\'t know if it\'s because this place is newer than the older LV location, and not polished yet but execution was poor...\n\nI had the Sage Chicken Benny, or thought I did... the first time they brought it out without the chicken... presentation was nice and flavors were great.\n\nMy friend, had a egg dish and asked for whites... but they messed that one up too...\n\nMy other friend had the banana and brown sugar pancake, and it was marvelous! You don\'t even need the syrup!\n\nThe food was awesome overall.\n\nThe biscuits were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. My friend noticed a little metal jar, next to the sugar, salt and pepper shakers, and discovered a wonderful blackberry chutney (jam) and it accompanied the biscuit wonderfully! Would\'ve been nice if the waitress mentioned it...\n\nThe mashed potatos with skin were great as well, perfectly seasoned, we didn\'t have to add anything to it.\n\nThe sage chicken is OMG good, although I would probably go with the chicken and waffles next time, cause I think the sauce on the benny, although good, was overwhelming... maybe if they used half the amount, I would\'ve ate the whole thing.\n\nThe amount of food they give you is like "hungry man" portions, and value, is well worth every penny! The only other complaint I have, other than the miscommunication between the order and chef was the feel of being hurried in a sense...\nThe portions are huge, so the group had about half of their dish left. Every 3 mins, it seemed one staff member or another lliked to come by and ask if we were done... let me tell, I was chewing my food still!!! also instead of asking us, if we wanted to-go boxes, they just took it away, when we said we were done... Now, perhaps it was our fault that we didnt say anything, but I thought it would\'ve been courteous and nice to have been asked...\n\nSo, I would give this place 5 stars for the food, when they get it right, and minus 2 stars when they are off, and in this visit they were off.'

It was kind of hard to find this place because It's pretty hidden all the way in the back of the Quad Hotel.\n\nSo for breakfast I got the Andy's sage fried chicken w/ fresh spinach, hardwood smoked bacon, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs on a biscuit   with mash potatoes. Even though you look and read it in your mind or out loud and sounds soooo delicious, it was just pleasant. It didn't wow me or had me like OMG but it definitely filled me up. \n\nPresentation  was awesome! It was a tower of awesomeness that I thought I could devour. The chicken wasn't bad because it was crispy on the outside and white meat in the inside. I wish the bacon was more crispy though instead of soggy because of the cream. The biscuit was huge and dense that I wan't really feeling it especially with the mash potatoes right under it. Mad carbs! The chipotle cream was really good as it had a little spice to it but wasn't overpowering. It was too much carbs though. Oh wait I said that.  It did cure my hangover but I don't think I would get this again although I am down to try other things on the menu. \n\nOther people at my table had the French Toast, Salmon, and the Chorizo on an iron skillet which all looked so good. \n\nPrices aren't bad either for everything.

The server was very friendly and made some decent suggestions. \n\nMy buddy opted for the chicken and waffles. It looked really good but he said that the waffles were soggy and really took away from the dish. I ordered the dish I saw on Man vs. Food, which was fried chicken, spinach, eggs, cheese, mashed potatoes and a bunch of other things. It was good but it really was just too much for the sake of being too much. \n\nI don\'t believe there are any Subway heart smart runner icon next to any menu item here.\n\nThe food was OK. I can now say I ate here.  After paying 60 bucks for two breakfasts and one drink,  I realize I could eaten very well for a few bucks more.\n\nIts worth checking out if you take it for what its worth. It reminds me of Tony\'s in Birch Run Michigan http://www.yelp.com/biz/tonys-i-75-restaurant-birch-run.'

For appetizers, the wings and onion rings were delicious. The best part of the meal was the burgers. They were perfectly cooked, the bun was fresh and the while thing was an explosion of flavor.

S'The burgers and the customer service are amazing. If you like spicy foods, the Hell\'s Kitchen Burger is delicious! The only "issue" was when I bit into a seed but it was too good. My boyfriend (basic ass B when it comes to food) ordered the Farm\'s Burger, which came with duck bacon and an over easy egg, and he loved it. Our cousin ordered the Blue Cheese Burger and he enjoyed it as well. \n\nFor my Hell\'s Kitchen Burger, I accompanied it with the GL Innis and Gunn beer, which was a great compliment. The Oreo Shake is also delicious. \n\nOur waiter checked on us several times and was willing to work with us if we didn\'t like anything. Burgers were roughly $10-$15, drinks are $7-$10, and appetizers are $10. For 3 people, drinks, appetizer, and drinks, we spent $78 total. \n\nIf you\'re in Vegas, stop by here if you want a good and affordable meal.'

S'I am giving this place 5 stars because I am the person that says, "there\'s only so much you can do with a hamburger" but this place proved me wrong.  I have always seen the "fried egg" on a burger option but never thought it sounded too good.  Being here though, I wanted to try something new and ordered it.  Wholly Cow!  (pun intended)  It was an amazing hamburger.  I can\'t wait to go back.  None of use were real thrilled with the fries but we did finish off our first round of onion rings and asked for a second order before we were done.  Our waiter was friendly and we couldn\'t have asked for better service.  They had a line but we just gave them my mobile number and they text me just before our table was ready so we were able to go up to the room real quick before dinner.

S'I had heard many great things about this place before my latest visit to Vegas.  So this was put at the top of my list to visit.\n\nGot here on a Thursday night and our party of 3 was seated immediately.  We waited about 10 minutes for a waitress to greet us.  I took immediate notice to the dress code of the servers.  EVERY SINGLE waitress had to tug down their one piece "dress" for every 10 steps they took.  Unnecessarily tight for servers in a restaurant... but it wasn\'t just the women... the men had on Polo\'s that also appeared to be suffocating them.  The only people who looked to be comfortable in their uniforms were the floor managers.   We did get our beers fairly quickly, once greeted by our waitress.  Everything on the menu is ala-carte, which is like most places in Vegas.  Between the 3 of us, we ordered the Uber Cheese Burger,  Britannia Burger, Chantenele burger and the Parmesan Fries.   We all ordered our burgers medium.  \n\nI\'m still laughing at the irony of being in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and waiting 45 minutes for our burgers to come out.  Mind you, there was no wait, it was 11pm and the restaurant was at less than half capacity.  Even more ironic, all of our burgers came out well done.\n\nNow, we all cut our burgers into 3\'s and split amongst ourselves to sample it all.  Even though our burgers were not cooked the way we wanted, they were all very tasty.  I could only image what they would be like had the meat been a little pink.   The parmesan fries were good and the sauces that came with were a treat.\n\nI only rate 3 stars as being a fan of Gordon\'s shows - I know the slow service we received as well as overcooked food is unacceptable to his standards.'

Great menu with plenty of more-than-basic options to choose from. I ordered the fish and chips sandwich which was great! She ordered a jalape\xc3\xb1o burger and truffle fries which were amazing as well. Only down fall was the two drunk idiots that sat down at our table and started making out.... WTH JUST HAPPENED! The waitress asked if they were with us and quickly got them out HAHA maybe have a railing around the outside table so no one thinks that there's open seating???

We got the blue cheese burger and the chanterelle burger with truffle fries. I mean after eating at Guy Fieri's restaurant with his Mac and Cheese burger full of cheese love and gooey goodness, I appreciated the simplicity of Ramsey's  burger.\n\nAlthough next time I've got to order that pork burger.\n\nService:\nOur waitress wasn't bad, but she wasn't amazing.

S'Had the Hell\'s Kitchen Burger and added an egg on top.  It was delicious.  I think I like Burger Bar, at Mandalay better, and I\'m usually not a big fan of Gordon Ramsay.  This was a good burger though.  I easily ate the whole thing.  That with a couple of the many beers on tap, made for a great meal!\n\nWe also ordered some sweet potato and regular fries.  They came out hot and crispy.  Service was also good.  No problems and everything went smoothly.\n\nThe main reason that BurGR is 4 stars and not 5 is because there was nothing overly special.  The food is expensive for a burger, but it is a good burger and was worth it.  I did want dessert after the meal, but when the waitress brought the dessert menus, I realized that it was just the 4 milkshakes that I saw on the menu earlier.  In addition, they also do not serve any coffee after dinner.  That was a bit of a pain.  I\'m slightly confused why they even offer "dessert."  Overall, good meal, and i\'m sure i\'ll be back one day...'

S'I give this place 3.5 stars. I marked it a four rather than a three because of that friggin awesome push pop dessert. So I arrived on Friday at around 6pm and there was a line along the restaurant at Planet. We ended up waiting a good 45 minutes before getting seated and you can definitely avoid that huge line at weird times like in the morning or late dinner. \n\nFarm burger- $15 for duck breast bacon and fried egg. This burger was alright. I shared this and it was enough since we ordered fries. The egg is barely existent and the meat was ok. I guess I am not much of a burger person but when something is good, I know wassup. This wasnt quite up to par.\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries- Hmm nothing special about these again. The fries were a bit soggy and I just wanted crispy. THere is some cheese sprinkled on top and there is truffle sauce and ketchup. I opted for the ketchup so that was a waste in ordering this.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding Push Up Pops- OMG bombbbb. This thing saved my meal and I was soo happy. It comes with two for $7 and at first I thought it was weird to be pudding but it really just is peanut butter ice cream with cake pieces in between. Delicious!! I love peanut butter and cake so these were the perfect size and so yummy. I wanted to get another round before I left for Vegas but that would be too gluttonous.\n\n**TIPS**\n1) Come at awkward times if you do not want to wait 45min-1 hour. I didnt see a line around 11am or 9pm or so.\n2) Do without the fries and get the Push Up Pops!!!\n3) Enjoy!'

S'I\'m sorry, but I was really looking forward to this place. My boyfriend took our friend from Malibu, California and I to this place and the wait was an hour and thirty minutes. I always knew there was a wait so that was of no concern. An hour and ten minutes later we tried to check in and apparently they did text us, but sometimes the system "doesn\'t work". Luckily, we checked in. The server was very nice, but the busser was extremely helpful. Now, the food runner was extremely rude to my boyfriend when he asked which burger was which. The manager never stopped once;  though it was a question on the review they hand out after your meal. \n\nWhat got me the most was the fact that their burger was nothing special. The meat was dry and the parmesan truffle fries were very hard. The sweet potato fries were ok though. \n\nJust came home and my stomach is really hurting. I am thinking my meat was undercook. \n\nOverall, go for the experience, but I definetely wouldn\'t go back. All the employees looked miserable.'

The openness of the restaurant was very inviting.  I had the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the Roasted Jalapeno Poppers.  The presentation of the poppers was nice and they were in individual shot glasses with their own dip.  It was good especially if you like spicy food like myself.  The only downfall of the burger was that I ordered my burger medium and they cooked it well done.  It was still good so I kept on eating it.  So despite what I wanted, it was still very tasty and I was quite pleased with the manager's attentiveness to the situation."

S"I'm not gonna lie: I have a man crush on Gordon Ramsay. Don't get me wrong, he's not Sam Jackson or the Rock, but he's definitely on the list. So when I was in Vegas for my buddy's wedding and happened (or, more accurately, drunkenly stumbled upon) this place, it was game on. \n\nLocated inside Planet Hollywood, Bugr has the now trademarked glass enclosed fire that Gordon Ramsay seems to enjoy a little too much. (I'm not saying that Ramsay is an arsonist, but if one of his restaurants burned down I think we can all agree he's a preeeeeety good suspect.) \n\nI went on a Sunday afternoon around 1 and it was packed. The line snaked around the perimeter of the restaurant, and many of the bigger parties left because of the 45 minute wait time.  Smaller parties, like mine, waited about 20 minutes. The hostesses were extremely courteous and polite, which I imagine can not be easy when you consider the the sheer number of drunken assholes trying to grab them inappropriately. I don't necessarily know why Vegas (and Bugr is no exception)  feels the need to put every woman working in the town in a short/tight/skimpy outfit, though. I get it if I'm at the Spearmint Rhino, but at Bugr? It just seemed a little unnecessary. However,  that being said - wooo! I love boobies, so maybe I'm being a bit disingenuous.  \n\nAfter our short wait we spent pondering gender inequities in modern society (cause, you know, were deep like that and stuff) we were escorted to our table. There is a giant touch screen menu on the exterior of the restaurant, so we already had a fairly good idea of what we wanted. The menu is fairly small with maybe a dozen burgers, (some chicken, fish, and vegetarian options available), a few hot dogs, some appetizers, a handful of salads and a smattering of milkshakes. I went with the farm burger, which had duck bacon and a fried egg, and my buddy had the hell's kitchen burger. We also ordered the Parmesan truffle  and sweet potato fries. To start we had jalapeno poppers. Those jokers may have been the highlight of the meal. They are served in individual dipping cups in case you're worried about getting cooties from your dining companions, and come with a bacon cheddar sauce. One of the six does not have the seeds removed which makes for a fun game of intestinal Russian roulette, especially if someone in your party can't handle a little spice. The fries were OK. The truffle Parmesan were a little too crispy for me, closer to being burned. The sweet potato fries had some seriously delicious dipping sauce accompanying them. I think it was honey mango chipotle flavored or something like that. The burgers are fantastic. My first bite literally melted in my mouth. The duck bacon was an interesting component, but ultimately,  it was overpowered by the burger itself. I saw some kid next to me put ketchup on his burger and it was all I could not to snatch him  out of his chair. You should NEVER  put any condiment on a good burger or steak; the meat speaks for itself. (Sidenote: who brings their kids to Vegas? You mean your kid will appreciate a trip to the land of debauchery and excess more than a trip to Disneyworld? You could be having pictures with Micky and dinner with Goofy, but instead your kid has pictures with penis impersonators -seriously happened - and dinner with Chardonnay,  the stripper?! Parenting fail.) \n\nOverall, Bugr is a great place. The wait staff, particularly Chris, was phenomenal and friendly and the burger was great. The price is comparable to other Vegas locations and you can knock eat at a celebrity chef's restaurant of your fatboy bucket list. Its not the best burger I ever had, but its close."

After a fast 25 minute wait, my brother and I were seated and greeted by the General manager. \n\nI ordered the Euro Burger and my brother ordered the Hog Burger (the waiter raved nonstop about it) and two sides of Parmesan truffle fries. \nBoth Euro and Hog Burgers were amazing. The protein was cooked perfectly and complimented the garnish, cheese and bun. While I loved my Euro Burger, I still thought the burger at GR Pub & Grill was superior (that burger was possibly the best burger I ever had). But my brother loved his  Hog Burger and reviewed it as the BEST BURGER he's ever had.\n\nthe truffle fries? oh yeah, ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

S'Yum! \n\nLoved this place from the moment I said "table for 2". I didn\'t even mind the fact we needed to wait 30 minutes for a table. They just told me they would text me when the table would be ready with the approximate time as well. I wandered off to gamble and they texted me at exactly the time they told me. Awesome. \n\nMy bf got the fish and chips burger. It was a different twist on the concept, especially since when the server brought it to us, it looked like a huge hot dog. Weird right? Interesting nonetheless. The only complaint from him was that there was more bun than fish. He devoured it nonetheless. \n\nI ordered the Farm Burger, duck breast bacon, sharp cheddar and a fried egg. It was delicious and very tasty. It\'s one of those burgers that you just fall in love with. \n\nWe also ordered the Truffle Parmesan Fries. I like them crispy so this was a tad disappointing as they are the fat fries that are very potatoe-y. The truffle aioli that came with as a dipping sauce was aweome and it made me forget about the non-crispy fries. \n\nAlso, we had the chocolate hazelnut pudding and coffee shake. It was INCREDIBLE!!! I normally am not the biggest fan of a shake, its always too thick or something is just off but the texture was just smooth and creamy. You could enjoy it and not need to suck too hard... =P. So where does the pudding come in? It comes in right on top! It was different, and a GOOD different. Yum. I would come back just to get this shake. I like Holstein\'s shakes, but this was just better. \n\nIf you are a Total Rewards member, you get a dollar off here and there. Nice plus!'

S"My girlfriend and I went there in August '13 and it was a great experience. The food was really good and the service was even better. After aproximately 30 minutes in the line (they don't take reservations) we were seated at a table close to the kitchen. At the table you get an interactive drink menu with info on all the cocktails, beers and wine. My GFs cocktail (slow screw) was good, but a bit too sweet for her taste (she didn't know what kind of drink it was beforehand). As a starter we shared the fury chicken wings. They were heavenly! The meat fell off the bone as soon as you cut into them. As for flavours - the mild ones were absolutely delicious. The spicy ones had blue cheese on them and I am not a big fan of blue cheese because I think its destinctive flavour overthrows all the others. But in combination with the spices it really worked out well. \nMy GF then had the Earth Burger and from what I tasted it was really good. The goat cheese really made it into something out of the ordinary. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen Burger and it was absolutely mouthwatering. The meat was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the whole palette of flavours was great. As a side I had the Beer Battered Maoi Onion Rings which were delicious as well. The house made Ketchup and Ranchsauce really stood out. My GFs Sweet Potatoe Fries were good, but we both didn't care for the sugar on top of them!\nSadly we were both too full to order some Shakes because they looked awesome...\n\nThe service was perfect!

S"I encouraged a couple of my mates to join me for Restaurant Week, and we decided to come here. We were told that there's a 30-minute wait, which turned out to be an hour. It was a little frustrating. The place's design concept is interesting, not in a sense that is negative, but definitely different from any other burger spots I've been to. Attention to detail was definitely not spared, from the tables down to the waiters'/waitresses's and hostesses uniforms. The iPad that had the beer, spirits and dessert menu was also a nice feature. The price is fair, and since we were there for Restaurant Week, it was quite amazing! We paid $20 for a burger, an appetizer (any of the fries or onion rings) and a dessert. In addition, I also tried the pork belly bun. Our waiter was pleasant and our water was never half empty (it's one of the things I keep a tab of).\n\nThe Food: I got the Euro burger, the pork belly bun, truffle Parmesan fries and the push-pop. The Euro burger, although the description was mouth-watering, it did not step up to the plate. The cheese was too over powering and I could hardly taste anything else but the cheese. The pork belly bun - it was loaded with carrot strings, the taste was good but you may need to remove some of the carrot strings. The fries was a bit too salty for me but the sauces were pretty darn tasty! So I would suggest, get the regular fries and just ask if you can have all of the sauces (there are 6 I believe). My friend got the onion rings and they were pretty good. The batter was light and was incredibly crunchy, however, the ones in the bottom, it's best to skip those since they are so greasy. The dessert was pretty neat experience, a sticky toffee/peanut butter ice cream push-pop. It's been a while since I've had a push-pop myself. The peanut butter ice cream was okay, but the sticky toffee pudding was pretty tasty! \n\nI'm rating this a 3 start instead of 4 because of the food. I felt I had to alter my food in order to enjoy it. Service/ambiance is a solid 4 (not a 5 since our wait time was double what was told to us)."

S'Great ambiance! Loved the decor and setting. Food was very good. The ala carte prices, for sides, were way too high ($8 for a small fry and $4 for a soda). Burgers were good. My daughter had the hot dog (no kids menu so they rip you off by making your little one order a full meal). \nOverall... Loved it. This was our second time here.'

S'I travel to Vegas several times a year, and Burgr was on my list of things to do this last trip. I took a couple of friends there with me. We all had the Farm Burger. It was amazing! It was cooked perfectly and had so many flavor profiles. I had really high expectations and they were met! I will be going back next time (August) for sure! Good job Gordon!'

S'The boyfriend and I do a few "staycations" here and there on the Las Vegas Strip. Where ever we stay is where we like to eat. Staying at Planet Hollywood we obviously ate at PH. There are a few places to choose from, and neither of us had tried BurGR, so we decided to pop a squat and eat. \nThe hostess was very sweet and informed us the wait for a table was about 30 minutes but we saw the "21 & older" area, there were a few open tables, so she sat us there instead. Now, knowing that this establishment is owned by Gordon Ramsay we expected to pay a few extra bucks but ultimately decided to just share our food because we were hungry, not starving.\n We started with the Truffle Parmesan Fries, which are served with a delicious truffle aioli sauce, followed by some Jalapeno poppers, which were also amazing. We shared a Euro Burger which is patty, truffle aioli, goat cheese, arugula, and a roasted tomato. Needless to say, I enjoyed my meal as did my boyfriend. Total wait for all of our food...20 minutes give or take, which I did not mind because there were distractions all around us that we were able to wait on and take our minds off of being hungry.\n We must have came on a good night because reading some of these reviews people had to wait for their food for over 45 minutes, the service sucked, and then there are those who don\'t want to fork up a few extra dollars. You\'re paying for the Gordon Ramsay name, not necessarily the food. \n\nAnyway, I loved this place.'

S"I was going to give BURGR a 4 because it didn't taste bad (but not great) when I had it.  It wasn't until about 45 minutes later until I decided this place was no good.  I felt like I ate a pound of salt, my clothes stunk like onions and had no desire to eat dinner.   The more I started thinking about it, the more cheesy the place became.  The service was over the top.  The waiters were not real people but actors,  the wings were so-so and when comparing it to an In-N-Out burger for 3x the price, then I feel ok giving it a 1 star."

S"I was really excited to try Gordon Ramsay BurGR since I wanted to see what the fuss was about after watching him on Hell's Kitchen.  I was definitely not disappointed!  \n\nWe ordered:\n* five spice chicken sliders - it was mixed reviews - half of us liked it and half thought it was only okay.  The chicken was not dry and had a good crispy texture, but the five spice flavor was very strong\n \n*honey-pig bao bun - delicious, delicious, DELICIOUS!  Not super sweet but all the condiments went together very well\n\n*earth burger - I love meat patties, but this Portobello mushroom patty can really convert me!  it was so packed with flavor and was juicy to the bite.  I would definitely get this burger again!\n\n* farm burger - the patty was cooked to what was ordered and the egg, duck bacon, everything worked well together\n\n* truffle parmesan fries - a little salty, but the garlic, parmesan, and truffle work well together \n\n*shake #5: chocolate hazelnut pudding + coffee shake + praline cookie - this was my FAVORITE from a great meal.  It was everything I was hoping it would be - sweet, but yummy coffee flavor and complimented the meal.  We passed this around the table and everyone agreed it was a favorite.\n\n* sticky toffee pudding push up pop - I was a little disappointed with this since I have been waiting to try the famous sticky toffee pudding Gordon Ramsay is known for, but if the little bit that was in this push-pop is what it tastes like, I think I can pass on it.  There wasn't any specific thing that was bad about this it just wasn't terrific.  After the shake, this was just a little of a let down.\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back if I am ever wanting a good burger and great milk shake.  They don't take reservations, so be ready to wait.  There were five of us and we waited 45 minutes - this was on a Saturday night at 6PM"

S'HOLY MOLY BATMAN this place has the best FISH sandwich I have had in my entire life! Yes best fish sandwich that has entered my mouth...Now why would someone order a fish sandwich at a burger place? Well it is simple:  Upon walking into the restaurants I noticed the burgers that were being served and yes they looked awesome, but my one pet-peeve about burgers is when they are stacked skyscraper high...I prefer to hit the "Easy Button" when I eat burgers and those burgers looked delicious but difficult to eat. So I audible to the fish sandwich, with french fries, and my wife ordered the truffle fries. (We will get to the fries later) \n\nThe fish sandwich is very fresh, light, crispy on the outside, but juicy and tender on the inside, they top it with thin crunchy chips for a unique texture, and the homemade tartar sauce is just blissful.  \n\nI would recommend skipping the truffle fries since I couldn\'t taste the difference in them compared to the normal fries, and the normal fries come with a smoky chipotle ketchup which is mouth watering (not given with the truffle fries).  \n\nThis is place is definitely worth the 15-20 minutes it takes to get seated, trust me you won\'t be disappointed. Next time I want to try to their milkshakes, those looked extra yummy as well.'

The bun, was fantastic and made this burger stand out over many others. The truffle fries were ok, but not out of this world. I kind of wished I had some normal ketchup as opposed to the fancy, but slightly odd tasting gourmet ketchup.\n\nI will probably come back to this restaurant again someday."

S"First of all, I freakin love Gordon Ramsay, I watch a handful of his shows (my favorite being Master Chef) and I'm a fan of his blunt and straightforward personality. That being said, I'm disappointed by the wait time for the table and the food.\n\nMe and a group of 5 friends came during EDC weekend around lunch time. The hostess was very kind and told us that it would be a 30 minute wait and would notify me via text (that's so cool!). This was not a problem, I had a large group anyways. After about 30 minutes, I get a text but we wait another 15 minutes for our table to get set up.\n\nAfter looking through the menu, I decide to order the farm burger (duck breast bacon?!?) and an order of truffle fries. What I've learned about watching Gordon Ramsay's shows is to be diligent and not to make your customers wait forever for their food. The funny thing is that we waited for almost an hour for our burgers and we only got one order of fries before the burgers (we ordered 2).\n\nGranted, it was probably the best burger in my life I can't rate this place any lower than 4 stars because the service was commendable and the food was delicious. Just beware of the wait time if you're starving or in a rush!"

S"You have not tasted an amazing burger until you have tried Gordon Ramsey. Absolutely nobody should compare this restaurant to bachi, because it is beyond amazing.\n\nMy friend and I came here on a Wednesday afternoon and only waited for about 5-10 minutes, which was fine because it gave us time to peruse the menu and check out yelp for some tips.\n\nI decided to try the brittania. The mango chutney made me a little hesitant, but I decided to just go for it and I'm glad I did. The mango, arugula, and sharp cheddar worked in a beautiful medley with the beef. It has this amazing sweet and savory was amazing.\n\nMy friend go the euro burger. She really loved it. I tried some of it, but it made me realize that I really don't like goat cheese. \n\nThe truffle fries were pretty great. It was actually really big. I shared with my friend and we couldn't finish it with our burgers. The sauce it came with was amazing. The truffle aioli was something else. Y'all need to hit it up!\n\nI forsure can't wait to come here again and try the hog burger, if I'm not really tempted by the Brittania again. It was that good."

S"Oh my goodness. These burgers certainly lived up to the hype. My boyfriend and I shared onion rings to start off the meal. The breading was a little thick for my liking but they were super crispy and fresh out of the fryer. I loved the freshly grated Parmesan on top and the cheesy ranch dipping sauce was tasty. Now the burgers. My boyfriend and I shared the Hell's Kitchen burger and the farm burger. We got both medium rare, which we had never had before. The meat was a bit softer than we had expected but well seasoned and the most flavorful patties I've ever tasted. Next time we would probably get them medium well or well done for texture. I loved the Hell's Kitchen burger which had a slice of avocado, melted white cheese, roasted peppers and tomato, which I thought was a perfect combination. The roasted peppers and tomato gave a great flavor and juicy freshness which made the burger seem a bit lighter. The farm burger was also superb. I loved the egg on top but the duck bacon could have been crispier. The only thing missing on this decadent burger was some crisp lettuce which would have definitely helped balance the rich flavors. The buns was also buttery and delicious. Next time we come to Vegas we'll definitely try one of the dawgs, which we saw someone else get and looked really good, as well as one of those gigantic shakes!"

S"Ramsay attempts to alter the nature of hamburgers from a completely transparent business perspective. The restaurant is presentable but lacks any trace of authenticity. The condiments of whatever clever burger you order are small and placed in the center of the burger- so if your burger has jalape\xc3\xb1os grab some water because you will swallow all of them in one bite about halfway through your burger. Shakes are good, then again it's hard to mess up a shake. Fries are fine. Not worth the money for any burger enthusiast. These burgers deserve a place in a picture but not a place in my stomach."

S"I'm torn about this place. On the one hand, the food is really good but on the other hand the prices are ridiculous. My meal was $35 before tax and tip. So ignoring the prices, the 4-star rating is just for the food. \n\nI ordered the farm burger, truffle fries, and Shake #5. I also sampled the jalapeno poppers, soba noodle salad, and sweet potato fries. The burger was really really good and the meat was a perfectly cooked medium! I loved the combination of the duck breast bacon, cheddar, and fried egg on the burger. Although I did feel like I needed some sort of greenery, maybe arugula? The fries were thick and crispy. The truffle parmesan and truffle salt on the fries made it too salty though; it could do with far less seasoning. The shake was incredible! It was creamy and super thick and surprisingly not overly sweet. \n\nThe jalapeno poppers were yummy but were a kick in the mouth. They were so spicy! I was not expecting my mouth to be on fire. The soba noodle salad was cold and refreshing but if I'm going to BurGR, I'm going to order a burger. The sweet potato fries we nothing extraordinary. I was really thrown off by the dipping sauce. It tasted kind of like vanilla pudding but it was supposed to be a honey jalapeno mayo? Weird...\n\nDefinitely give BurGR a try because I think it should be experienced at least once."

S'I have been searching for the perfect burger for a while now, and I have my top pick for all that is burger at a little place called Maple & Motor, located in Dallas, TX. It\'s legit, and make no mistake, I can\'t exactly compare the two, so I\'m going to claim a new favorite burger... outside of Texas! Yes, I know... there will be some dissenting views and opinions, but the world has much to offer and Gordon Ramsay has done it right in Las Vegas with his latest creation. It\'s BurGR time!\n\nThis particular night we went to BurGR, we had just left seeing Penn & Teller at the Rio, where we were staying.  Knowing full well that we probably couldn\'t eat late on a Monday night, I suggested we go anyway to Planet Hollywood and see where the place was first and then just spend some time gambling in the casino.  Turns out, we got there by 11 and the restaurant was still serving.  We hadn\'t eaten since Noon, and figured why not? Let\'s eat now!\n\nNot knowing where we were going exactly other than Planet Hollywood, I\'ll go ahead and say the one negative about out experience, and then I\'ll move on.  The restaurant had only been open for about 3 months, and the signage in the hotel had not been updated to reflect where exactly the hell it was.  As tourists, we figured it would be simple to locate, but Planet Hollywood has a shopping mall behind it called the "Miracle Mile," and it really is about a mile long in diameter of retail shops located behind the hotel. With this said, finding someone to help, much less give you directions when the mall area is closing, as well as the long walk to the front of the hotel where BurGR is located, is a bit much with no signage or any sense of direction, but after a few minutes of parking and asking a few questions, we finally made it to our destination. \n\nWhen we arrived, the hostess was awesome and excited that we had come to join them for a fantastic meal.  She said, "I have a couple of servers working, but I have the perfect guy for you.  He\'s awesome, and you\'re really going to have a great time!" This set the tone for the night, and we were not let down.\n\nWe sat down, got our menus and began looking them over, while looking at all of the wonders the restaurant had to offer in regards to decoration and experience.  Next thing I know, a guy named Alex (with glasses) walks up, says "Hello," and thus began our journey to Awesomtown. \n\nA glass of wine and a Boddington\'s for myself were quickly ordered.  The menu was fully explained, and then we were given a few minutes to decide.  There was little debate for the both of us, as we both quickly found our favorites.  My Mom decided on the Hell\'s Kitchen Burger (Asadero cheese, jalapenos and avocado) and I chose the Farm Burger with duck breast bacon, English sharp cheddar and a fried egg.  We also decided to split a side of truffle Parmesan fries with truffle salt, truffle aioli and chipotle ketchup with molasses. Wow!\n\nThe burger was served medium rare with a solid  1/2 pound of a chuck, short rib and brisket mix.  The 600-degree wood burning grill gives the meat a texture like no other and the apple and alder wood gave an amazing smoke flavor.  This burger was juicy, flavorful, a bit glamorous to taste, but with a bit of a backyard feel that made me love every bite.  It was simple.  No dressing, no veg and a made from scratch daily sesame seed bun that was to die for.   What could possibly make this any better? Yes, those previously mentioned truffle Parmesan fries.  They were amazing, and the truffle aioli spread that came with them, I could have eaten by the spoonful and had been satisfied.\n\nTurns out that night at Midnight, Alex (with glasses) was having a birthday.  We started talking and I told him about my Mom\'s birthday, where we were from and why we were there.  Next thing I know, the manager Emily from the restaurant came by, and then Alex (with glasses) brought us out an amazing treat to share with him for his birthday.  I never would\'ve thought prior to my night at BurGR that I would ever enjoy this particular dessert, but we were brought a salted peanut ice cream and chocolate maple pudding cake, served push up style.  All I can say is, "Damn, that was a tasty treat!"\n\nI\'m officially claiming this Burger Hunt as the best I\'ve ever had, outside of Texas.  The greatest I have experienced in the Lone Star state still hands down is Maple & Motor, but I would be hard pressed to claim a winner if these two establishments were in the same town.  The style and atmosphere is 180 degree opposite of each other, but the food doesn\'t lie.  Great burgers and great people serving up something they believe in always wins.\n\nWell played, Gordon Ramsay! You\'re not just another TV chef with attitude anymore in my eyes.  Now that I have experienced what you have to offer, I have a whole different respect for what you\'ve accomplished in your life.\n\nTill next time my friends... stay hungry and keep on the hunt!'

S"Three words: Southern. Yardbird. Burger.\n\nIf you go to Gordon Ramsay BurGR (and you will), this item has to be one you consider trying. Now, I know the Hell's Kitchen Burger and the American Burger are popular items; but listen to me: you see that photo I posted of that Southern Yardbird Burger? That could be YOU.\n\nWith that out of the way, Gordon Ramsay BurGR was enjoyable overall. My crew knew that there was going to be a wait in order to seated; we got to the restaurant around 5 on a Friday. Once we got the text message that seating was available, it was on. I can't remember exactly who our waiter was, but he was on point the entire time; made sure drinks were filled, provided great recommendations, and provided that Las Vegas hospitality to some folks coming from the East Coast.\n\nI can definitely see why this place stays packed: good food + good drinks + good service + friendly atmosphere = satisfied and returning customers.

My friends had the shakes and had no complaints!!!\n\nHowever, the service i was not impressed with at all. After waiting an hour to be seated, we were sat at a table (there were 5 individuals) that was meant for 4 people and the hostess did not act as if there was any issue with this placement. Next, we ordered shakes that came before our water and to top it all off, the waitress never told us that the fries came in such large portions so we looked pretty stupid sitting there with the fries but luckily we were able to have 2 orders of fries removed from the bill.\n\nOverall it was an okay place.'

S'Through no fault of Gordon Ramsay\'s, I had a very odd experience at Gordon Ramsay BurGR, and I will definitely have to give this restaurant another chance on another occasion.\n\nIt all began when we rolled up at about one p.m. on a Saturday. I was very much looking forward to trying this place as I am quite the connoisseur of delicious burgers and truffle fries. We stood in a very long line for a bit next to an elaborate fire display (not feelin\' the fire, by the way, because it was about 120 degrees outside as is). The hostess eventually came around to take our names and told us that it would be about an hour wait.\n\n"That\'s no problem at all," thought we. "We\'ll just head over to the bar to kill some time." Famous last words.\n\nWe headed deeper into the Planet Hollywood casino and found ourselves ordering up at Fat Tuesday. Not a wise decision. At all.\n\nBy the time we were seated at our Gordon Ramsay BurGR table, we were already crossing over from pleasantly buzzed to quite unintentionally intoxicated. Woe.\n\nStill, we ordered two of the truffle parmesan fries for the table and a burger each. The fries ($11) were absolutely fantastic. The parmesan topping was fabulous, and the truffle aioli dipping sauce they were served with was to die for. Two orders were probably excessive on top of our already uneasy conditions, but they were certainly delicious enough.\n\nThe burgers took some time to come out, and unfortunately for me, I was no longer in the mood to feast upon my blue cheese burger ($14) when it was placed before me. From what I can recall, it was well-cooked and very tasty (albeit rather plain). Though "gourmet," these burgers aren\'t very daring. They are simple burgers, average sized, and topped with typical add-ons. There is not much that makes them stand out.\n\nBut maybe I was just drunk. My apologies to Mr. Ramsay. I will have to give BurGR another shot -- this time after fewer shots.'

S"Given his three shows on Fox, I had long been curious about Gordon Ramsay and his cooking.  It's clear he knows his stuff (hence the yelling), but backing it up is another thing.  Despite my curiosity though, we didn't plan on hitting up two of his restaurants (GR Pub and Grill was the other)...but it certainly worked out well!\n\nWhile I liked the decor and service (our waitress Tammy was super friendly...and funny), let's be honest - Gordon Ramsay's name and food is what people really care about here.  Compared to the other burger joints I've tried in Vegas (Holstein's and BLT Burger), BurGR's menu options aren't quite as plentiful.  However, for what they may have lacked in quantity, they certainly made up for in quality.\n\n-- FARM BURGER with Duck Breast Bacon, English Sharp Cheddar, and a Fried Egg...$15/$14**\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#sBOTjyHkhxZRVOLVnCLvsA)\nThe black and white sesame bun was pretty different visually and I liked how soft it was.  The patty was both moist and flavorful and while I would have preferred pork, the duck bacon went well with the egg and cheese.  Pretty tasty overall.\n\n-- TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES with Truffle Parmesan, Truffle Salt, and Truffle Aioli...$11/$10**\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#czEJpJ9QxE-ALZlpWMgZ6Q)\nThe fries were cut a little larger than I expected, but they were still so crispy and delicious.  Just loaded with truffle flavored goodness.  Definitely recommended.\n\n-- SWEET POTATO FRIES with Vanilla Powdered Sugar & Honey Jalapeno Mayo...$9/$8**\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas#xl00KTbEFS-UTX4o0wVLoQ)\nWhile the Parmesan Fries were a hit, this one completely missed.  Since the fries are naturally sweet already, adding the powdered sugar was overkill.  The five of us only ate a third of it before giving the rest to our friends that came in after us.\n\n**NOTE: Menu prices are slightly cheaper if you have a Total Rewards player's card.\n\nGiven Gordon Ramsay's burgeoning popularity, there's typically a wait for a table, but make a reservation at the hostess stand and you won't be tethered to standing in the line the whole time.  Even if you don't though, the burgers at BurGR are worth the wait.  Now to try Gordon Ramsay Steak to complete my set!"

My fish sandwich was beautifully presented, but that was the highlight. The piece of fish itself was very good, but the fried toast bun was way to greasy. My friends hamburgers both cam medium rare, but only one was order that way. I tasted both and found them to be bland and surprisingly dry for being as rare as they were. Most importantly though, there was nothing unique about them. They were just burgers with a lot of flair. My friends both ordered milkshakes which were good, but both were essentially creamy puddings masquerading as a milkshake. Again, good, and somewhat unique, but not $9 a piece good. That is the only thing I thought was really over priced. I had a Johnny Walker Black and it was delicious, but I don't think the restaurant had much to do with that. \n\nAs a local I know of several burger places in town that far out strip this place. I don't want to drop names but there is an Asian Fusion burger place in town that blows this place out of the water for comparable prices. And for better flavor at much better prices there's a place owned by a group of guys, five of them I think, that is a much better meal and value. \n\nSo for the tourist I say this is an OK place to go.It is owned by a famous chef, it is in a great location, and it is an OK meal. Most places on the strip for this price are merely just OK meals. It is worth eating at and getting your picture taken out by the sign. For locals we all know better places which are much easier to get to."

Party of 2.  \n\nOnce I was seated, I placed my drink and food order with the waitress in a timely order.  \n\nAfter that, she never came back.  We received the food from a different worker, never once was asked if the food was good or if we needed anything else.   \n\nThe burgers were good no complaints.  1/3 of the fries were undercooked so you couldn't eat all of them.  \n\nIn the end we had to ask a random worker for the check because we had been finished and waiting for 10-15 minutes with no service.   He actually went to tell the server we needed the bill and she didn't even bring it to us.  Someone else did.  Pretty lame.  \n\n\nBurger was good\nFries 50/50\nService whack."

S"I was so glad that my cousins and I got to try out this new burger or should I say burGR joint in Vegas!\n\nI came with a party of 6 and at first, we were dismayed by the LARGE line coming out of the front (still have no idea what that line was for) because we walked to the front and instead of waiting in that line, the hostess took down my number and said they would text in ~a hour when our table was ready. We walked around the shops and not even 30 minutes later, received a text that our table was ready. I appreciate a restaurant that does not tell you the wait will be 10 when it's actually 30, so for the wait to be LESS then what they told us....brownie points to BurGR!\n\nItems Ordered:\n- Roasted Jalapeno Poppers\n- Sweet Potato Fries\n- Truffle Parmesan Fries\n- Shake #4 \n- Hell's Kitchen Burger\n- Farm Burger\n- Euro Burger\n\nI love a place that cooks a burger the way you want it and you could tell the meat was quality meat - juicy!!! I personally loved the farm burger for it's ooey gooey egg!\n\nEveryone loved the food, the staff/service (did I mention that the servers leave a iPad that you can browse their whole drink menu on?).\n\nI would rather pay to eat Gordon Ramsay's BurGR than Umami any day!\n\n:)"

Burgers were not as tasty as I had expected, perhaps my expectations were too high.

S"In the past couple of Vegas trips, I was bombarded with so many advertisements for Gordon Ramsay's new burger spot at Planet Hollywood that I had my heart set on checking this place out. I was so excited when our group decided to go, but my excitement turned to disappointment after my first bite of my burger. There are so many better burger spots in Vegas.\n\nFood:\n1) Hell's Kitchen Burger consists of roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, cheese, and oven roasted tomatoes. The patty was a bit overcooked than what I ordered and it was a bit dry. The first thing I noticed was that the bread was spongy, which threw me off. It just didn't go well with the burger overall. I think I would've rated the burger higher had a different bun been used. In addition, I can't justify paying $14 for that level and size of a burger without fries. 2 Stars**\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=wLuYs8aW3W1-xGoBhl1dKQ#JHKC0BPLK7zcydP_yMYlIg\n2) Truffle Parmesan Fries were some of the best that I've tried. I could actually taste the truffle and there wasn't too much parmesan cheese that it masked the truffle flavor. 4 stars****\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=wLuYs8aW3W1-xGoBhl1dKQ#-HoXHBgziWqfUPopOFdPVg\n3) Roasted Jalapeno Poppers were simply top notch! I would have to say that this is one of the best Jalapeno poppers that I've had so far. The cheese was simply amazing and the exterior had just the right amount of crispiness. 5 Stars*****\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=wLuYs8aW3W1-xGoBhl1dKQ#iMTTzSQznYIMRsJueVsFlg\n4) Fury Chicken Wings consists of 4 tangy hellfire blue cheese wings and 4 honey-wasabi wings. I really liked how the wings were very meaty pieces. However, the flavor was too tangy for my taste. The honey-wasabi wings were better, but I won't be ordering this again. 3 stars***\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-burgr-las-vegas?select=wLuYs8aW3W1-xGoBhl1dKQ#xaNXVkPms8gHggUGj4GELg\n\nService: 4 Stars****\nThe hostesses were very friendly and efficient. The wait was over an hour and a half long, so we ordered to go. It was very convenient because after they took our order, they just texted us when the order was ready, which allowed us to gamble while we waited."

Only thing that could have made it better is if Gordon had a Vegan (egg free) bun. \nOur server was friendly, funny and provided great prompt service! \n\nThe wait can be a bit long at times but the experience is worth the wait.\nThe restaurant is located immediately off the casino floor of Planet Hollywood and you can also access from Miracle Mile shops. \n\nCool decor and moderate prices (12 burgers if memory serves right) \n \nWill be back for sure!\n\nPlease thumb up/comment if you liked this review and I would count it a privilege if you chose to follow me as I review places I travel and visit.

This menu fit the bill. \n\nThe wife and I went at 11pm on a Sunday night and had to wait a few minutes to be seated. The hostesses were very friendly and helpful. \n\nOur server (Tammy) was top-notch. Seriously, one of the best servers I've ever had anywhere. She knew the menu back and forth, was lots of fun and kept me topped off with water at all times. Huge points for that. \n\nThe beer/wine/cocktail list is presented to you on an iPad which I thought was a great touch. \n\nNewcastle battered onion rings were great as an app, and both burgers (Hell's Kitchen and Euro) were outstanding \n\nThis place doesn't disappoint"

It was one of thee hardest decisions of my life deciding what to get because everything sounded so good.\n\nI went with the farm burger and it's basically like a breakfast burger, but the duck bacon has this delicious smoky flavor and the sharp cheddar cheese was a perfect pairing.  The BEST Onion Rings I've ever had, beer battered, huge, and had a great presentation.  I couldn't wait to try the shake when I heard it was half pudding and we got the highly recommended chocolate hazlenut, I had already premeditated ordering that as soon as the waitress asked for our drinks you can believe it didn't last long. My friend tried the hot dog and that was next level! You've probably seen the pictures, but the meat is very high quality - not your typical lips and asses. \n\nI can't wait to  revisit  Burgr and explore the rest of the menu in depth.  I was really debating getting the Truffle fries or the fish and chips, but didn't want to get too bogged down before a wild night on Vegas.\n\nService was on point, the only problem was lack of stomach space so I could try everything!"

Tasted like "fancy ketchup" from Whataburger with spice mixed in. Worst Fail. Waitress only came by once to take drink/food order then disappeared until she came to tell us she was leaving and to introduce her replacement. Gordon Ramsey needs to try harder next time.

S"Quite simply, the food at Burgr was absolutely amazing and I would even say that this was by far one of the best burgers I have ever had.  We had the Britannia burger, and the mango chutney it it was a great taste pleaser.  The garlic fries are also a fantastic side, and enough fries for 2 to share.  The atmosphere was quite pleasant, although the 35 minute wait to get in was frustrating.  It would be nice if they accepted reservations or gave the ability to book on open table. \n\nNow here is my negative why I took a star away.  The girls at the front desk could have not been more disinterested in their job if they tried.  When we went up to ask how long of a wait, it seemed like we were doing nothing but bother their petty little discussion.   Not cool.  As for the waitress, she took quite a while to get our order, someone else brought it out, which I was appreciative of as I didn't want to wait all day, and lastly, once we were done, no waitress to be seen.  A bus boy cleaned our plates up and when I finally asked the hostess for our waitress to bring our bill, the manager ended up bringing it to us.  This didn't seem right.\n\nIn short, go for the burgers as they are absolutely unreal, but flip a coin if you will get decent service or not.  Just don't be in a rush when you go!\n\nEnjoy!"

The honey jalape\xc3\xb1o that came with the sweet fries and the aioli and ketchup that comes with the truffle fries are very good.\n\nI'd give them 5 stars on the shakes. 3-4 on the fries and 4 on the burgers. Overall, 3.5 stars but round up to 4 stars to be fair.  That said, my standards are fairly high.  If McDonalds or Wendy's is your standard, then this kills it.

The quality of the meat was on another level, and the cheddar cheese that melted on the meat was the perfect complement.\n\nSides Notes\n\nAmbiance:\nThe d\xc3\xa9cor was casual with TVs throughout.

I do have comments on how amazing the Earth Burger was. On the menu there is one vegetarian option and that is the Earth Burger. I have had plenty of vegetarian-friendly burgers over the years, but this burger is definitely one of my favorites. I did not feel like I was missing out by having one. To top it off, I ordered Shake #4 - the oreo, creme brulee pudding shake. I'm a such sucker for sweets and desserts. So when I saw that I could not say no. After one sip, I was in dessert heaven. The pudding - oh man the pudding!!! That was the shining star in the combo. Thick, rich and decadent. I'd go back just for the shake alone."

It was the perfect match (and perfect excuse) to line ourselves up for 40 minutes to get one of those coveted tables.\n\nAll of the servers are extremely kind, helpful, and knowledgeable about the burgers. Each one comes out in a perfect sphere of deliciousness, and it is quite a bit embarrassing to try to stuff it in your mouth to take a bite, so this may not be the place to take a first date. I ordered the Farm Burger, and everything was absolutely scrumptious. I savored every single bite and felt perfectly full afterwards. The truffle fries were equally as yummy and are definitely a must-try.\n\nThe cherry on top that made this meal even better was the dessert shake. I ordered the coffee with chocolate hazelnut pudding (doesn't that just sound amazing?), and I was in heaven. If there's one thing that I would want to eat when I'm having a bad day, it's that. I'm craving it right now as I'm being reminded of its creamy and chocolatey taste.

Stop with the kitchen nightmares and improve this place first! \n\nAs a huge MasterChef fan, I was really hoping BurGR would live up to its hype, but really everything is sooooo average and overpriced to boot. The patty is pretty tasteless with a weird texture, which is surprising given that I asked for it medium rare and it's supposed to be cooked over some smoky apple wood or something else exotic. Pretty sure all of the 5 stars are from people who have had one too many fat tuesdays (which is also in pH and a wayy better bang for your buck) \n\nOn the plus side, great service and cool menu design!

The sweet potato fries with ketchup instead of that weird sauce that comes with it were gobbled up and fought over. We had reservations at le cirque, sage, nobu, tao, but this was our favorite and that\'s why we blew off lunch at bouchon to come here AGAIN! This time we had the jalapeno poppers which were INSANE, and hubby had a shake... which was ridiculous (its like pudding in a glass). British thing??

We eat out a lot and like simple food, so you could say my family are experts at burgers and fries.  We loved the food.  I heard several times from my wife and kids that the burgers were the best they've ever had.  My wife loved the Garlic Parmesan with truffle  sauce.  \n\nI had read about the sticky toffee pudding desert at another Ramsay restaurant so I ordered those for all of us and everyone loved them.  Their staff was a treat to be with also as they were friendly and top of things, including bringing refills before they were needed.\n\nBurGR is a top notch place, great service, nice friendly staff and excellent tasting food.  It's no wonder why Gordon Ramsay is so successful as he makes his places the best hands down."

S"A few words to sum up my 5 star review of BurGR: MY BOYFRIEND CRIED TEARS OF JOY. SERIOUSLY.\n\nGet the Hell's Kitchen burger (INCREDIBLE oven roasted tomato and jalape\xc3\xb1o slices, tons of avocado, and asadero cheese melted on and around the edges of the meat) and truffle parmesan fries. We both got the same burger and shared the fries, and agreed by the first few bites that this was hands down the best burger and fries of our lives. We couldn't express enough gratitude to our server or the co-owner of the restaurant, who was personally going around making sure that every table was satisfied. We went a second time during our 4 day Vegas trip (that's how you know it's good) and we got the same awesome meal and treatment.\n\nPerfect service, perfect food. I can't wait to go back!!"

S"Burgers by Gordon Ramsay? Sure why not. My wife and I are fans of Hell's Kitchen and since Ramsay now has three restaurants in Las Vegas, paying a visit was a no-brainer. Gordon Ramsay BurGR is located in the Planet Hollywood near their front entrance to the Strip. As we approached we could tell that there would be a decent wait due to the long line out front. However, this was Las Vegas on a Friday night, so that was to be expected. Thankfully the wait wasn't long and we were seated quickly by our hostess. Their menu has Ramsay's spin on American burger joints. We both had basic cheeseburgers which tasted out of this world! The meat was well seasoned and they were made exactly how we ordered them. We also tried his version of jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers which were served in individual shot glasses of ranch. They tasted good and for something that was fried, the pepper and it's stuffed contents tasted fresh. The real standout for our meal was the butterscotch shake! Good lord was that a treat! It was their homemade butterscotch ice cream  topped with their freshly made butterscotch pudding. All I can say is wow!"

S'3.5 stars\n\nGordon Ramsay has been a busy man in Las Vegas, opening three restaurant concepts in three different hotels within about 8 months\' time. His latest is his most casual and approachable - a burger joint within the Planet Hollywood hotel. Coming off of dinner the previous night at Gordon Ramsay Steak, this would be our second consecutive red meat meal from Ramsay.\n\nThe menu is very streamlined and focused here, featuring a handful of snacks/appetizers and about ten burger options. There isn\'t your build-your-own-burger type place, which is something I appreciate. Fries and a couple of salad and hot dog options round out the menu.\n\nFarm Burger duck breast bacon, english sharp cheddar, fried egg (substitute regular bacon)\n\nHell\'s Kitchen Burger asadero cheese, roasted jalapeno peppers, avocado, oven roasted tomato\n\nMy dad went for the Hell\'s Kitchen burger while I went with the Farm. Disappointingly, they were out of the duck bacon, so regular pork bacon was substituted for it. I\'d have to say the burgers were pretty well done, with a nicely-cooked pink center for the meat and a very soft bun. The meat had a subtle smokiness, nice char and was pretty juicy. My fried egg was cooked perfectly, with the yolk oozing out once broken. Considering the bacon and egg on the burger, this was about as close as I was going to get to brunch on this Sunday morning. I thought this was a pretty good burger.\n\nJust Fries hand cut fries, chipotle ketchup, curry ketchup\n\nThese larger-cut fries were done well too, crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. The housemade ketchups were quite good too. Simple but executed well.\n\nI don\'t think any diner is going to be "wowed" here, but the food is actually quite good. The burgers, while simple, were thoroughly satisfying and cooked just right. And while we didn\'t try anything other than sides the french fries, those were just as satisfying. There are a ton of options to alleviate a burger craving on The Strip; I would consider BurGR one of the legitimate options.'

S"Farm Burger was good. The duck-breast bacon added good flavor but it was not crispy, which I'm guessing has something to do with it being duck-breast based. The burger itself was cooked well and had good flavor. Parmesan fries were good and crispy and served with a very tasty garlic aioli. It was a little pricey but I would go back to try one of the hot dogs."

We also loved the fries! The come with 2 delicious dipping sauces, and there was one that I LOVED, but I forget what the name of it was.

S'The Truffle Parmesan fries are AWESOME!!! The burgers are cooked very well, and are very tasty, but we still prefer Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay better.  What held this back would be the size and seasoning of the burgers (burgers a little on the small size and could use more seasoning on their "just fries" and Farm Burger.

S"I'm a big fan of Ramsay, his persona and his cooking.  BurGR seemed like a cool place in concept, look and feel and with so many rave reviews, the expectations were probably tough to match.  Look for an updated review in the near future but my first experience at least in tastebuds has been 'okay'.  \n\nWhen you get there, you're usually first greeted by a massive line if you're coming in during the peak rush hours.  Luckily, that line moves by pretty quick and the hostesses usually come around looking for specific party numbers to get everyone moving.  I got to sit in the counter area where the action was happening.  The decor was pretty cool as well with a fiery front piece and the staff were nice enough.  \n\nThey have a nice drink menu on an iPad (curious if these iPads are on the tables as we had to ask for the iPad at the counter) and a good selection.  The menu itself consists of burgers, sandwiches, appetizers and some desserts.  I debated between the farm burger and the Chanterelle burger and ended up with the farm since so many Yelpers were happy with it.  I also got some regular fries and an ale on draft.  \n\nThe fries were pretty good - full potato slices so they were pretty thick with curry and a slightly spicy ketchup sauce.  It reminded me of Umami although the sauces perhaps lacked a little more fire than others who have tried a similar menu deal.  The burger looked pretty fascinating - a nicely cooked patty, duck bacon, a fried egg on a sesame seed bun.  The duck bacon was excellent in itself and the fried egg was a nice complement.  Perhaps I felt the burger lacked a certain kick of flavor along with the fairly dry bun.  The burger felt like it should have melted in my mouth but only the bacon/fried egg did.  Unfortunately, the end result was a so-so taste experience.   \n\nIt isn't to say the restaurant is bad persay - I just believe that the burger I had was a bit overhyped for what I was finally expecting.  It's definitely a cool joint that is worth checking out for burger fans and shouldn't completely destroy your wallet.  I just think I'll give it one more try and look for another burger with a bit more oomph in taste.  \n\n[You get 'preferential access' and slightly cheaper prices if you're a Total Rewards member by the way.]"

S"My boyfriend and I made a stop here on our Vegas trip. We were very satisfied with our choice. Our disappointment with Gordon Ramsay's steakhouse included very rude staff and mediocre food (seems to be a consistent criticism amongst the yelpers). However, Gordon Ramsay's Burgr is a whole different restaurant compared to his steakhouse. The service was excellent! Very prompt, professional, and happy! The overall vibe of the restaurant is more laid back and casual with a trendy element in the decor. And this time, the food was great and far more plentiful. We ordered the euro burger, Hell's Kitchen burger, and a Oreo creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e shake. The euro burger was so flavorful! The flavor of the first few bites was so delicious, however, it was quite overwhelming and filling towards the end of the burger. I would've preferred it in a slider size. The Hell's Kitchen burger, although not as flavorful as the euro, was excellent! It was not quite as heavy on the stomach as the euro, which made eating the full sized burger much easier. My personal preference would be to have more heat/spiciness from the jalape\xc3\xb1os on the HK burger. And the Oreo creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e shake was certainly unique and tasty, but nothing special in the way of taste (they have nice straws though!). My overall experience here was great and I would definitely return to try some of their other items. \n\nOh and also I was happy because I got to see Christina Wilson in the kitchen! She was the winner of season 10 Hell's Kitchen! I was cheering for her during that season. Happy to see her in Burgr's kitchen!"

All the burgers were excellent --- the truffle fries and sweet potato fries were delicious.  Servers provided iPads to view the drink menus; nice touch.\n\nThis place accepts Total Rewards points too, which is a plus.\n\nFor a group of six that each got a burger, shared three orders of fries, and maybe one drink each, price was about 27 each.

S'As soon as the UFC fights were over, hubby and I were hungry! I didn\'t have a chance to read the Yelp reviews about this restaurant but we had a wonderful time at Gordon Ramsey\'s Steak so this place couldn\'t be bad, right? As a celebrity chef made famous by being going ballistic with other restaurant owners for bad food, service and decor I have held his restaurants to a very high standard.\nWe had arrived and were seated promptly. Always a plus! I got a chance to see the different seating arrangements: Tall tables with bar stools, comfy lounge chairs at intimate seatings for two and booths. We were sat at the intimate table for two and I immediately sank into my chair. I came up to the table a little higher than my chin. After a few minutes it didn\'t matter because the chair was so relaxing. The yummy cocktail, Goodbye Blue Sky, was fruity luscious! \nWe had been waiting some time to our server, Daisy, was able to get to us, but she did stop to recognize us and apologize for the wait. Appreciated the acknowledgment. She took our orders and got back to whizzing around her other tables.  \nThe place was busy with a few open tables, but when the Shania Twain show let out there was a long line and a lot of people at the bar behind me. Always good to see a busy place and it gave me a chance to people watch as I waited for my food.\nThe food: We split a Caesar Salad. It was made with butter lettuce instead of Romaine and I missed the crunch. The dressing was made without anchovies. What?! That\'s so ridiculous!  If you don\'t like anchovies, don\'t order a Caesar Salad! And it was overdressed which  also added to the limp factor exacerbated by the use of the more leafy lettuce. I had mine topped with anchovies, but it wasn\'t the same. Disappointment\nI had the Fish and Chips while the hubby had the Shepard Pie. The fish was crispy on the outside and steamy, flaky fish on the inside. I requested the fries be extra crispy, but the slices were thick, so most of them weren\'t crispy. To be fair, I know that it\'s difficult to fry a thick slice crispy without burning it so I let let slice. It was ok, just limp. Hubby\'s entree disappeared before I finished, so I can only assume it was delicious! His father was a cook (and a fabulous one at that!), so when I asked how it was he just said, "OK" Thank so the detailed description, but the empty bowl pretty much says it all.\nI paced myself and didn\'t eat all the fries, so I was ready for dessert. I ordered the Toffee Pudding and hubby got the Spotted Dog. Both desserts were awesome! Both tasted freshly made and the sauces were so good! Our server poured the sauces over our desserts, but there was some extra bourbon sauce on hubby\'s that he poured into his strong French pressed coffee. Now this is how to end a meal!\nWhen we return, I will definitely try the Beer Flight with my meal!'

S'My dinner at BurGR began a string of three new 5-star Las Vegas restaurant dining experiences in a row.  We began here with great hand-cut Truffle Parmesan Fries that resembled steak fries, and excellent Beer-Battered Maui Onion Rings with delicate splinters of Parmigiana-Reggiano Cheese adhering to the battered rings.  For dipping the O-Rings, we were supplied with a creamy Cheddar Ranch Dip and a very good requested Truffle Aioli.  We also received homemade Chipotle Ketchup, specially requested housemade regular Ketchup, and specially prepared requested Mild Yellow Mustard for my American Burger and Diane\'s Uber Cheese Burger.  I liked all of the sauces and condiments provided but still prefer Heinz Tomato Ketchup over all other varieties.  And, with all the choices at our disposal, I got mixed up switching between the two types of Ketchup on the table and recalling which was which. \n\nThe beautifully seasoned and perfectly prepared burgers were flat-out outstanding!  Diane\'s Uber Cheese Burger featured a large and juicy medium-rare Uber Cheese Burger made with Fontina Cheese and Raclette Cheese (it also normally comes with Goat Cheese if desired), and my American Burger sported a delicious, amply-sized, and moist medium-rare burger with nicely melting American Cheese, Butter Lettuce, pickles, onions, and a small Heirloom Tomato.  Both burgers were sheltered in a nice soft Poppyseed & Sesame Seed Bun.  For good measure, Diane also enjoyed a thick and well-received Mixed Caramel Pudding & Chocolate Shake with Whipped Cream, that was accompanied by a Toffee Cookie.  This is a shake to be reckoned with!\n\nService was friendly, professional, highly accommodating, and very efficient.  The only off note was that I had to get a new appetizer plate after finding a bit of food crud stuck on the one originally presented to me.\n\nWhile this is at heart a burger joint, it is a high-class one, with exemplary quality control.  For example, I observed an expediting chef inspecting each finished dish as it reached the pass before approving it for delivery to tables, just as Gordon Ramsay often does in "Hell\'s Kitchen."  You won\'t find this occurring in many establishments that feature hamburgers as their primary entr\xc3\xa9e!\n\nWe arrived at 10:00 p.m. on a Tuesday, and were seated about 5 minutes after our arrival.  Even though I\'ve been told that the lines can be amazingly long on other days and times, that will not deter me from returning here again and again. \n\nThe burgers are just that good!'

S"This place is WOW!\n\nThis restaurant gem is located on the 1st floor of the Planet Hollywood hotel.  I went during dinner time and it gets REALLY crowded fast.  The good thing about this place is that you can put your name and number down and they will give you a call when your table is ready.  This is super convenient because this lets you go do something else (like gamble) without having to wait around a table for 1+ hours.\n\nI also have to praise the decor here as well. The restaurant logo in the front on fire, literally.  There are tiny flames that are ignited to surround the logo to really give that wow factor, (and maybe to emphasize how flame-broiled the burgers are here).\n\nWhen I get here, we started with the jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers and onion rings.  Both were delicious and came out in these amazing plates/containers.  I personally thought the onion rings were much better than the poppers so if I had to choose one, I would get just the rings.  Then I ordered the chanterelle mushroom burger which was cooked to perfection.  The bun is soft and compliments the flavorful meat and toppings.  You can also tell this restaurant is well established because every dish ware here is customized for this restaurant.\n\nLastly, we also ordered the coffee hazelnut milkshake.  This drink is just AMAZING.  There is a layer of milky coffee on the bottom and there is a thick creamy hazelnut pudding like texture on top.  I believe you mix the two to get the perfect consistency but they also taste so good separately.  One of the coolest and tastiest milkshakes I've had!\n\nTo top it off, the service was fast and great and really looked after us because we were sorta in a rush.  Thanks BurGR, I will be back!!"

The chantarelle burger was certainly good with a nice combination of mushrooms and some sort of a fig jam, but not one of the best burgers I've ever had. Truffle fries were cooked well, and certainly large enough to share. We arrived right as they opened for lunch so we were able to get a table immediately. Like many places in Vegas, they go a bit overboard on the technology, just because they can (ipads for cocktail menus, mobile device for payment, etc), which is ironic because it often makes the process more difficult.

This was seriously a FLAVOR EXPLOSION. The hot dog had a genuine, juicy beef flavor and was slathered in tasty chipotle ketchup. I devoured this massively long hot dog at a record speed. Even the bun--the sweet, crisp bun--was a standout in comparison to hot dogs I've eaten in the past. With a tall beer and no sides, eating the whole dog left me satisfied. \n\nThere was only one small trouble. Right before my mom took the last bite of her hot dog, she discovered a hair amidst all the juicy hotdog madness. She instantly felt grossed out by her meal, of course. The manager came to the table and removed the cost of her hot dog from our bill.

It\'s not so much of an explosion of flavor or something along the lines of "WOW, I never tasted this before!", it\'s just that the meat quality is really good.\n\nThe thing I would honestly only come here for:\nThe Jalepino Poppers. They fried perfectly, so you don\'t burn your tongue when you bite into these delectables. They come half dipped in these shot glass, filled with a nice tangy and creamy sauce. Even dipped, the poppers are soggy, still retaining their crunchiness. I would surprisingly say, this is a must try more than the burgers!!\n\nOh one thing, always try to yelp this place up and call it to make reservations! sometimes the line can get long, but the wait isn\'t that long, you just end up standing in front of this art that has fire just pouring out. It gets pretty hot if there stand there for awhile. SO MAKE RESERVATIONS!!'

S"I've eaten at a few Ramsay restaurants and Burgr doesn't disappoint. Is the line long? You bet- and for good reason. Glad we didn't have to wait at all in line. There's a way to not have to wait, but I'll let everyone complaining about the line figure it out on their own. Meanwhile, we'll skip the line while those with self-appointed 'foodie degrees' give this place a poor rating simply because they don't know the simple way to avoid said line. \nThe Earth Burger is delicious. Yes, it's vegetarian. The truffle parmesan fries are amazing and the 'Skinny Screw' cocktail tastes like Kool-Aid. Four of those with dinner and I was ready to party all night! \nThe banana, snickerdoodle, butterscotch shake.... WOW! \nPerfect wait staff, fast service. Spot on. Love how your bill comes accompanied by an iPhone with a survey to rate your experience. Nice to see someone cares. \nOverall- I'd highly recommend this place. We'll definitely be back!"

S"I had dinner here for the grand opening night. Considering it was the first official day of their opening, service and food was excellent. The waitstaff was friendly and made sure drinks were always full. The burgers themselves are a little smaller than average for a gourmet burger but very delicious. All items are la carte so make sure you order some fries. The truffle parmesan fries are great with their dipping sauces. The highlight of my meal was the strawberry shake with coconut pudding. It's is the most expensive shake I have ordered ($8) but it was also the best shake I have had. The shakes are a must. I would come back again."

Nothing overcooked, perfectly pink on the inside. \n\n\n1 star off for the wait (1 hour!). Also, my party of 10 got split up into two tables that weren't even next to each other but instead on opposite sides of the restaurant. This is something Gordon Ramsay would not be happy about."

S'Just okay. Service was decent and the sides were good but our burgers were decidedly average among the "high-end" burger joints popping up all over Las Vegas. Also the pudding shakes don\'t quite measure up to a good ice cream shake. The fish sandwich looked excellent, wish we ordered that instead. For a high end burger and a shake you would do better at a few (less crowded) places, especially Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay which is outstanding.'

S'I am so confused by the comments that I have overheard from other patrons. Some girls were dressed up in their finest club wear, talking about how the food was good, but then said they should have gone to McDonald\'s... Wow! That is all I have to say about the complaints about this place.\n\nMy experience was nothing but positive. My friend and I walked in without a reservation. The place was packed. The hostesses greeted us and told us it would be a ten minute wait. We barely got a chance to ask the bar for the drink menu before we got escorted to our table. On our way back the girl was engaging and sweet.\n\nChelsie was our server for the night and she gave a great spiel. It was quick and concise without feeling like she was rushing to get somewhere else. She came by our table on several occasions to check on us. It was not invasive and her bubbly personality was refreshing. Her busperson was on the ball. I wish I caught his name, but he was meticulous about clearing our dirty plates away and refilling our waters. They actually replace each water glass instead of just bringing carafes or pitchers around. I felt bad for him because my friend and I are water guzzlers. They worked as a perfect team. \n\nJoanna, the manager, came by our table during our meal to check upon our satisfaction. We had nothing but positive things to say about our experience and she was definitely a part of that.\n\nThe food: The Jalapeno Poppers were gigantic. Of course in a game of Russian roulette I would draw the one with the seeds in it on my first piece. It was not too hot and the ranch mellows it out. The Pork Belly Hot Dawg reminded me of a Vietnamese sub. It had pickled diakon, carrots, cucumbers, and edamame on it with a drizzle of sriracha mayo. It was difficult to eat until we started to cut it up like an open faced sandwich. The "dawg" was on the salty side, but every other aspect was enjoyable. The Chanterelle Burger was moist, tender, and melt in your mouth. The mushrooms had a nice texture. The onion jam was a nice take on the classic combination of onions and mushroom. It gave an overall sweetness to balance all of the savory components. As a side, the two of us share the Truffled Fries. The potatoes are cut into pieces that look like wood slabs. Enough surface space to catch the truffle oil. The parmesan cheese could have been spread out and melted a little. It just sat on the top in a clump like cotton candy.\n\nThe drinks: The specialty cocktails did not look too appealing to us. They were geared towards the club crowd. Instead the 30 beers on tap are the way to go. If GR Pub aims for international selections than BurGR has premium domestics down. I was impressed with all the beers they had on tap. Arrogant Bastard is one of my favorite breweries. $7 for pint is not bad at all for the Strip. The only complaint about the night would be the delay in drinks. We were finished with our appetizers before our beer came.'

S"Quick review.. I loved the one other member of our party of 4 loved it, the other two thought it was okay... At like 11pm on a Thursday we went for dinner once we checked in. Was told 30-45 minutes, gave our number so they could text us, 5 minutes later while watching the Bellagio fountains across the street, the text came. \n\nService meh, waitress had friends sit at the table next to us about half way through and it was like we didn't exist. \n\nThe Poppers were EXCELLENT we all agreed on that, the Maui Onion Rings, good (but I'm not a huge parmesan fan) so I didn't expect to love them since I knew they had them. \n\nI had the Farm burger medium rare and perfect! Was one of the best I've ever had. Duck Bacon, sharp cheddar & an egg... SO GOOD... \n\nWife had the Euro burger seemed to really enjoy it. \n\nFriends spit a burger (not sure which) but they asked for medium well (and it was split) so you could see the temp and it was medium rare-rare so it had to be sent back. But by this time out waitress had stopped paying attention to us, so making this happen was a task. \n\nFood was very good, I'll chalk up the poor service to our waitress. Good ambiance, would try again. \n\nWe also got some of the pudding shakes to go a few days later as we passed through (too full to try the first trip in) those were excellent. Something you don't really get anywhere else, but worth it as a togo item to try if you don't have the time to stop in and want something sweet and tasty."

S'I had expectations that this place would be great, given Gordon\'s televised rants demanding perfection. Apparently he has a different standard for his own properties.   First, when I ordered my burger (which cost $15 with no sides), I asked for it to be cut in half. The waiter told me there was a knife on the table and I could do it myself. Then, it took over 30 minutes for the hamburger and $8 fries to arrive. I ordered the meat "medium well" and at least 1/2 the thickness of the inside of the patty was pink. Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, but I won\'t be back to Gordon\'s.'

I WILL be coming back next yr when we return. It might be a wait, but all you have to do is tell them at the front that you have a party of whatever amount of people, they tell you how long the wait is, and you're set to go. We stayed across the street at the Jockey Club and sent someone over to put our name on the list. We got to relax in our room for the hour it took.

S"This was the first place we decided to eat during our Vegas vacation. I think the food was good but not mouth watering, mind blowing amazing. There have been several restaurants I have been to where I can't even believe how good the food tastes. You know, the kind of food where you feel like you're going to melt into your seat with every bite. BurGR wasn't like that for me and I think I was expecting that. It really didn't taste any better than some other decently good burger places I've been to. I think my expectations were huge considering who's restaurant this is and how we're big fans of his.\n\nMy boyfriend absolutely loved his Hell's Kitchen burger. I had the American burger but changed it to swiss (actually they didn't have swiss but gave me a similar cheese instead) and added mushrooms. It was good but nothing amazing.  Also we did have the Maui onion rings; those were delicious!\n\nMy boyfriend may not agree with my 3 star review and demand I should give 4 or even 5 stars but he has a Yelp account and can write his own review, this was my experience. I would go back, yes, but next time I hope my burger is a bit better, maybe instead of getting a classic burger I should have opted for one of the specialty ones."

After being forced to watch Hell's Kitchen for so many seasons by my wife. I was excited to go to one of Ramsay's restaurant to see what the hype is about.  I believed the hype after I took a bite from my Hell's Kitchen burger. It was hot and fiery, and I couldn't stop eating it.\n\nThe ambience is hip and modern.\n\nThe menu has a good selection of burgers, hot dogs, and desserts.\n\nThe food is worth the wait.  The burgers aren't your average quarter pounders. They're thick and juicy patties of meat. The fries are of a generous  portion.\n\nThe price is surprisingly reasonable.  \n\nThe staff are fast and friendly. They know the menu really well.\n\nDefinitely gonna be going back.\n\nNotable mentions: the Hell's Kitchen burger, the American burger, and French fries."

S"Gordon Ramsay Burgr is a prime example of everything that is wrong with a modern restaurant.   Start with the staff, horrible.  They text us when our table was ready (I like that idea), however when we arrived to be seated we had to wait another 15 minutes while our table was getting ready and we were corralled several times to get out of the way by a bunch of scantily dressed host staff (kids).  The atmosphere, loud and annoying.  The food, even worse.  Start with greasy fries and the worst dipping sauces, mayo but not mayo for the Europeans, and catchup but not catchup for the Americans.  Both sauces were terrible and the fries dripped with grease.  Next the onion rings were even filled with more grease and the batter didn't stick to the onions.  You had to eat them with a knife and fork and the sauce was another disappointment.  A good dipping sauce for onion rings is chilled thick ranch dressing, sounds simple but very few places provide a good ranch.  The stuff they served here was so bad I could not eat it.  Next was the shake or what they called a shake.  It was more of a parfait concoction with various flavors but it didn't resemble a shake in the slightest.  When you are craving good old ice-cream forget ordering this crap, it isn't even close.  The only good thing about the shake was the cookie.  Finally the burgr, another huge disappointment.  Rather small but thick and undercooked.  My wife cannot eat red meat so she ordered hers well done and of course it was completely red in the middle.  The staff argued that it was in fact well done, we were already miffed about the shake so we didn't argue, just vowed to write this review and never come to this place again.  When you consider paying an average of $35 for a burger, fry and shake the price is insane and what you get for that price is criminal.  Never felt so ripped off before.  I love the food channel and enjoyed watching Gordon do his thing on TV but this restaurant has changed all that.  I have zero respect for this marketing fool who is selling overpriced garbage."

Had a few truffle fries, bit to salty for me, the manager came over and asked if we would like new ones,  he was kind and thoughtful.  Then the burgers!  Mouth watering, and delicious I had the signature Hells Kitchen with jalapeno, avocado, roasted tomatoes and cheese.  With every bite I didn't want it to end.

You only get six but well worth it.\n\nI got the Farm Burger medium and my hubby for the Blue Burger medium rare. The burgers melt in your mouth and they do not need any type of sauce. \n\nThe Farm Burger has a fried egg with duck breast bacon and sharp cheddar cheese.

First of all the decor and everything was super cool and impressive. Very simple and easy to choose menu with a picture of Gordon on the back. The clothes/uniforms that the servers wearing were also cool. Dark denim jeans and button up shirts for the guys and full zipper short tight dresses for the girls. Very hip and young staff. I ordered the euro burger and my husband ordered one of their foot long hot dogs.  5-7 mins later our orders are in front of us and we were really impressed by the quick and friendly service. I ordered my burger medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. We also ordered the sweet potato fries which comes with a light creamy sauce and powdered sugar. It was also pretty good. The only thing thing that amazed me was the manager actually came to our table and asked us about the food and how we were doing, is there anything that she can do for us. When you get a treatment like this at a restaurant even if you ordered some fries and burgers, you actually feel very appreciated for choosing them and being their customer. Young staff, great food, excellent service I give this restaurant 5 starts! Definitely try and go here. \nP.S; The restaurant is inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel on the strip."

My bf ordered the britianna burger medium and loved it. I ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger substituted meat for portobello patty . Honestly I would love if they actually had a veggie patty instead. It was really good and I love that you can substitute any of the burgers for meat free but a regular veggie patty would be much easier to eat. They put double portobello on there which was actually too much and made the burger fall apart and hard to eat. It was still really good I'm not complaining about that .\n\nWorth trying for sure!"

S"Oh Chef Ramsay, must you be so awesome?...\n\nI kid of course...well, in a sense I do.  To be honest, I am the last person you would find buying into the hype of a celebrity chef.  An on screen persona is not enough to judge  one's culinary prowess or personality in the kitchen, since of course everything is likely played up for show.  And on top of that, going to a restaurant that tauts the name of a chef without having them present to prepare the food also lessens any impact their name would have.  I imagine Chef Ramsay was involved in the restaurant to an extent, however, and to be fair to all parties BurGR did nothing to discredit any claims of greatness on his part.\n\nTo set the stage for our trip here, you should keep in mind that we drove in from Southern California the day after Thanksgiving, and due to the festivities of the prior day had not eaten all day.  By the time we had checked in, found the place, and got in line it was already past 10 PM, a full 24 hours since the last time we had eaten.  I will try not to let my delusional state from that ordeal affect my overall impression, but I feel it's necessary to add it as a footnote (a footnote smack dab in the middle of the review, mind you).\n\nAnyway, on to the experience itself.  The wait wasn't as bad as I had feared, but it was still a decent wait (I think when all was said and done it came out to around 30 minutes).  The hostesses were friendly and regularly checked up on the line to give updates, which I felt was a nice touch.  My fiancee and I had already gotten a chance to review the menu by the time we were seated, in an effort to expedite the process as much as possible.\n\nOur waiter was...I struggle for a word...fantastic?  That sounds a bit excessive, but he was very good.  He was welcoming and attentive, refilling glasses without needing to be asked, and was more than willing to provide answers to any of our questions.\n\nBut I'm sure you want to know about the food.  We ordered the onion rings, Parmesan truffle fries, and then the 'chili' dog and farm burger.  The onion rings surprised me a great deal.  It's hard to pinpoint exactly why, but they were definitely some of the best I have ever had.  The fries, on the other had, had a good flavor but also had a weird consistency to them, almost soft and thick (but not like normal steak fries). The chili dog is almost false advertising (despite the menu listing all of the ingredients) as it didn't really have anything resembling chili on it...really more of a chili inspired dog.  My fiancee didn't enjoy it as much as I did, but then I am a fan of red peppers.\n\nThe farm burger (might as well highlight the food item that gives the restaurant its name) was probably one of the most decadent burgers I have ever had.  Burger with duck and a fried egg on it...I can feel my circulatory system clogging up just thinking about it.  It was a good burger for sure, but I hesitate to say it's the 'best burger ever' or some ridiculous claim like that.  It did not disappoint, however.\n\nPrice wise...what can I say?  It's a celebrity chef's restaurant in Vegas, of course it's going to be a little pricey.  But I didn't feel like we were getting ripped off, just that we were splurging a bit.\n\nI recommend, though I do not feel it warrants repeat visits."

S"Good for the price. \nFarm burger: bun very good, meat itself could have used more seasoning, fried egg could've been less cooked. Overall burger a bit dry.\nParmesan truffle fries: needed to be cooked more (needs more crisp!) overall taste really good! Especially with the garlic aioli. Best garlic aioli I've tasted!\n\nHubby got the Hell's Kitchen. Delish and just the right amount of spice!"

I would of taken any fast food joint's burger over this.\n\nWings tasted boiled, over boiled.\n\nI'm Chinese, cha siu pork baos, yeah nice try.  The server said they buy the baos from a Korean place?  Uh...its a Chinese dish.\n\nThe manager took off the appetizers on the bill.  When asked about my burger, he took that off too.  I was like jeeze, I don't need a free lunch.  Just make it good. \n\nBeing from San Francisco, we may be a bit snobby but seriously, we know good food, all kinds of food, especially burgers.  \n\n5 stars for Garrett our server.  Sorry his great customer service couldn't make the burger taste any better, so 1 star overall.  Many pretty good looking servers including Garrett."

The Farm Burger is the best burger I've ever had! It's got a quail egg and duck bacon on top which makes for a delicious combination. The truffle fries were pretty good, not the best I've ever had. \n\nI'd say the service was above average and the staff was friendly and knowledgable. \n\nHighly recommend anyone else to try it out while in Vegas especially if you're looking for a good burger."

S'I was very excited to try Ramsay\'s food, as I\'ve been a television fan for a long time.  We ordered Ice water with lemon, and only received ice water.  We ordered the onion rings as an appetizer; the homemade ranch was delicious, and the chipotle ketchup was ok, at best.  The onion rings were quite greasy, although seasoned well.  For the main course, we ordered the "Farmer\'s Burger" (I can\'t fully remember the name, but it was a burger with duck bacon and an egg on top) ( I would rate this burger alone a 3.5), the "Hells Kitchen Burger", and the Truffle Fries with Truffle Aioli.  The hells kitchen burger was charred so badly on the bottom that I could taste nothing but burnt, and had absolutely no seasoning.  The burger had roasted jalepeno, tomato, and avacado on top of a cheese I cannot remember the name of.  We had a shift change mid service, so the new waiter took a while to catch on that the burger was sitting there untouched.  We advised him that not only was it charred, there was NO seasoning whatsoever.  He brought back a less cooked burger, but with no seasoning still.  To have roasted vegetables with raw (thickly cut) avacado on top with NO salt was a slap in the culinary world\'s face.  The only salt was from the cheese, which you could taste in the last bite (as all the toppings were eaten already.)  I would never go back, and will never eat at a Ramsay restaurant again.  To "rectify" the issue with yet another unseasoned burger told me that it was intended to be bland.  No thanks, for over $50 I could have eaten three times the amount at In N Out burger and been completely satisfied!  (Oh yes, the fries were ok, more garlicy than truffley...but the meal cannot be held up by the fries.)'

S'Excellent burger in the high end of the scale! \n\nWas a bit skeptical to the whole "Gordon Ramsay put his name on this place" thing and thought that maybe the whole hype is more beause of the name then the actual food. \n\nWas happy to see i was totally wrong! Ok, so part of the hype is because of GR himself but the quality and taste of the food is great anyway. \n\nWe started of with the jalepeno shooters wich was 6 awesome cheese/bacon filled jalepeno poppers with lots of punch. Great start not to be missed! \n\nThe pork belly "pig bao buns" wich was a kind of a slider in a pita looking bread was not as good. It was way too much carrots and the bread was doughy and way to thick. The pork belly was tender but that was about everything that was good with this starter. Sorry Gordon!  \n\nAnd for the finally i took the Hells Kitchen burget with some kind of cheese, avocado, jalepeno and oven roasted tomatoes. Medium grilled and it was perfect when it came out! Ordered a side of mayo since there where no sauce on the burger but the burger with condiments was so juicy and tasty i left all the mayo.  \n\nIm a true burger nerd that love to test both chain and upscale burger with fois gras and truffle but this is one of my top 3 burgers i have ever had.  The price? I think it was about 15 $ wich is less then a mediocre burger at Hard Rock Caf\xc3\xa9 or similar place where i come from. I think its a bargain even though its a little bit more then the usual burger chain.'

S"Came here with the family that was in town.  Very steep prices, but really no different than anything else on the strip. \n\nStarted with some apps.  Onion rings, jalape\xc3\xb1o poppers, and the wings.  Loved the wings, very good sauces, liked the lollipop.   The onion rings were some of the best I have had.  Battered to order, great taste. Poppers were good also, great cheddar dipping sauce.  I thought there was a little too much breading on them though. \n\nEverybody ordered a burger, one person ordered the 5 spice breaded chicken sliders.  Lets start with the sliders, phenomenal!   The breading was perfect and very flavorful, even better than the burgers.  I ordered the farm burger with the egg and duck breast bacon.  Egg on a burger is always a good option, but I felt the bacon was lost, really didn't add anything.  The other three also ordered burgers, they all really enjoyed them. \n\nWe also ordered some sides.  The sweet potato fries were very good, and we also ordered the regular fries.  Regular fries were good, but greasy.  There was a pool of grease at the bottom of the cone that seeped onto the table. \n\nOur meal was great, we will be back.  My only complaint, three of the burgers were overcooked.  Mine was the only one that wasn't.  We did nothing about it because they were so good."

S'Dear Gordon f*cking Ramsay, Esq.\n\nDude, you need to chill.  You have like 275 shows on TV, most of which consist of you screaming your balls off at some poor sap because "the soup was dry".  I only ever watch Master Chef, and that\'s because you dispense earnest, humanizing advice that gives the impression that somewhere deep inside, you still kind of give a sh*t, which your image desperately needs.  But seriously, Master Chef Junior?  What\'s next?  Master Chef \'n Da Hood?  Master Chef in Space?\n\nAnd no, I\'m not brainstorming for you.\n\nAnyway, the point is, we get it, you\'re a "brand", but we are so bombarded with your visage that it almost makes it seem like your place as culinary alpha-and-omega is maybe not arbitrary (no one can deny you are an accomplished chef) but seemingly self-appointed.  So, because of this, I went to BurGR (the only one of your Vegas restaurants I can consistently afford) with the firm predisposition to hate it.\n\nAnd based on the decor alone, at the beginning I totally did.  Your face is all over the damn place, your hostesses looked plucked out of a Hooters calendar, and the flames-and-metal decor is over-the-top and uninviting.  But, I have to say, once I sat my ass down and started stuffing my face, my mind changed quickly.  Been three times already, and it wasn\'t some kind of fluke.  The garden burger with the duck bacon and fried egg is as good a burger as I\'ve ever had.  Definitely top three.  The fries with the fancy ketchup are absolutely delicious and the service was quick, effective and infallibly polite.\n\nI also have to give you kudos for keeping prices reasonable, at least comparatively speaking for a Vegas strip restaurant.  Fries are not included with the burgers but one order can easily feed two people, which is nice to know in advance.  You have an awesome beer selection and I was pleasantly surprised to see that for $6, I get a tall pilsner glass filled to the top.  The Innis & Gunn is a particularly awesome pairing with any of the burgers.\n\nAnyway, I still find you kind of odious, but food-wise, BurGR is firing on all cylinders, and ultimately that\'s what\'s important.\n\nThe water was a bit raw, though.'

He ordered the Hell's Kitchen burger, I had the fish & crisps sandwich, and we both shared the truffle fries. All were phenomenal, and we highly recommend them. It took a while for the food to come out, but we both thought it was well worth the wait. \n\nWe arrived around 8:30 and were seated within five minutes, but I noticed that we beat a long line of people waiting for tables.

The wait was about 40 minutes but knew that going in. My 7 year old son ordered the hot dog, by far the best damn hot dog ever even for $11. I know this cuz he couldn\'t eat it all so I did. The other 5 of us had various burgers and the chicken sliders all of which were good but nothing out of this world. We had all 3 types of fries with the sweet potato fries being our favorite. All in all $150 for 6 to eat was really spendy but we were there for the name and the experience. Not disappointed not blown away. Only complaint...what is wrong with just regular ketchup?'

S'What can I add to 400 reviews of a place that is busy all the time?  I\'ll just give a bit from our experience.  Everything was just about perfect from the service to the food except for my hamburger.  I ordered the "\xc3\x9cber Cheeseburger" medium.  The hamburger came out well done.  It wasn\'t just well done, it was really well done (you know what I mean), and it pretty much ruined the taste.  The hamburger ended up being good and bad - there were parts that were pretty flavorless and there were parts that were pretty good due to the selection of cheeses.\n\nThe truffle parmesan fries were excellent and kept the overall rating at four stars.  I probably won\'t be back; I mean, I\'ve only spent two nights in Vegas in my life and there are so many places to try, but if it were close to home, this would be a regular destination.'

The burger was fantastic, one of the best I've ever had. The fries were good as well but a bit strong for my taste. They were good due to the refreshing experience the fries offered; never before have I tasted anything like it. The shake was top notch as well. The bill holder is fitted with an iPod touch so customers can conveniently leave their remarks. \n\nThe table I sat at seemed a bit close to other patrons on both sides of me, sort of like a speed dating row of tables. But I didn't find it uncomfortable. It sometimes gave my party a chance to recommend a good dish to someone just being seated. I'm sure it could also work vice versa. \n\nI had a wonderful experience at BurGR. Couldn't recommend it any more."

S'This place has received a lot of good reviews so maybe my experience was just a fluke. I came here for dinner on a Friday night to get a quick fuel up before an evening of Las Vegas festivities. There was a bit of a wait which is totally understandable on a Friday night. We were actually seated really quickly. The ambiance of this restaurant is really nice and it is very well decorated. Our waiter was prompt and attentive throughout our entire meal. The selection of craft beers was very good.\n\nI ordered jalapeno poppers for an appetizer and the uber cheese burger for dinner. The poppers were good. The outside was well fried and crisp. The dipping sauce they were served with was an excellent compliment. \n\nUnfortunately my meal went downhill after our appetizer. I ordered the uber cheese burger and when it came out it was clear it had been left to sit under a heat lamp or just on the counter as it was warm but certainly not hot or fresh off the grill. Additionally, the cheese on top of the burger was not even melted. I also ordered two different sides of fries the sweet potato fries and regular fries. Again, both were just warm certainly not freshly prepared. The dipping sauces for both were very good though.\n\nI have certainly had a better burger and eaten at better restaurants in Las Vegas for the same price. I will certainly not be coming back.

Roasted and peeled and thick sliced...(not finely chopped from a can).\nFries:  Cooked perfectly (how can you mess up fries rt?).  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and the grated fresh parmesan, truffle aioli, and truffle salt didn't hurt either.

My parents decided to eat later so that we could eat at the two seats at the bar ( I had to be back at the airport and could not wait the hour)  That was a little disappointing that I couldn't eat with them.  I got the Uber cheeseburger that was good and Shake #3  was absolutely killer.  My brother got a plain cheeseburger and fries.  You had to pay extra for the fries.

I did enjoy the ranch sauce that you dip the poppers in, it was very yummy, refreshing, and helped with the heat of the popper. Next we got ours Burgers and the Truffle Parmesan Fries. The fries were so delicious. I love Parmesan cheeses and these fries were top with lots of it. I order the American Burger. It was very good but I wanted well done.

S"2014 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 39/100\n\nMy boyfriend and I were on a mission to try all of the Gordon Ramsay restaurants in Las Vegas this weekend! BurGR was our second stop of the trip!\n\nBurGR is located literally right inside the Planet Hollywood Hotel. SUPER easy to get to from the lobby! They have this AWESOME glass window display with a metal structure emitting a bunch of flames all over it. It's really interesting and a great storefront display! They also have a bunch of Gordon Ramsay merchandise at the front such as t-shirts, cookbooks, glasses, etc.\n\nWe were able to walk right in and get seated immediately. However, a few minutes after we had been sitting at our table, I looked over to the front of the restaurant and there was a HUGE line! We got super lucky that there was nobody there when we entered at around 11:15am.\n\nThe decor of this place is super trendy, modern, and basically a sports bar with all of the large screen TVs on all of the walls displaying football and other popular sports. There are also lots of flames everywhere (I'm assuming are related to Hell's Kitchen) and a photo of Gordon Ramsay.\n\nWaiter service was great, as usual. Our waiter immediately came to us and asked if we wanted to take a look at the drink menu, which is an iPad 2 that they give you to look at. It is an interactive menu that has all of the drinks sorted by category (beers, cocktails, red/white wine, etc.), descriptions of each drink, and even photographs. There's also a tab with Gordon Ramsay's biography and photograph, which I thought was pretty cool.\n\nWe ordered two waters, a cup of coffee, and then took a look at the menus. The menus were pretty amusing because they, too, had a giant photo of Gordon Ramsay that surprises you when you first order them :P\n\nMy bf and I ended up sharing the Shake #4 - creme brulee pudding + oreo shake + oreo cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING! I had seen photos of the shakes on Yelp and was curious to try them because I've never had a shake infused with pudding before. Thanks to this shake, I am a HUGE fan of the pudding + shake combination from now on :) So yummy! The two flavors look separated (with creme brulee on top and oreo on the bottom), but surprisingly when you sipped on it, the flavors were combined and complimented each other very well. I would love to come back to try the other 4 combinations!\n\nAs for burgers, I ordered the Uber Cheese Burger (fontina cheese + raclette cheese + goat cheese), and my boyfriend got the American burger (american cheese + butter lettuce + tomato + pickle + onion). As a HUGE cheese lover, my burger was absolutely PERFECT for me! It was literally just the patty + 3 types of cheese, which was exactly what I wanted. My bf nearly inhaled his American burger and said it was super good. We unfortunately decided to skip out on getting fries because we didn't have the appetite to eat that much food! I would definitely like to come back to try the truffle Parmesan fries and the sweet potato fries.\n\nWhen we received our bill, we were given an iPod that had a little survey/questionnaire for us to answer based on our dining experience at BurGR. The Yelp Elite in me naturally reached for this and began answering the questions like crazy :P I thought it was pretty cool how much they integrated the use of iPads and iPods at their restaurant!\n\nOverall, 5 stars for a really trendy, hip atmosphere, great service, and delicious food! I would love to come back during my next visit to Vegas! :)"

S'The service is very enthusiastic, eager to introduce most of the more "interesting" items on the menu. Our waitress also gave various recommendations, which made selections from the menu a bit less daunting. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n-Beer battered Maui Onion Rings\n\nVery good, when paired with the condiments, it may be one of the best onion rings I\'ve ever had. Does not have too much batter and still has enough onion; very well balanced.\n\n-Truffled Fries\n\nHas the faint scent and taste of truffles.  Very well balanced, as the truffle does not overwhelm the fries, but definitely helps elevate the overall quality of the fries. Very good.\n\n-Hog Burger\n\nA great and ingenious burger. They were able to couple the smokiness of the grill and the richness of the pork to produce a very well balanced burger. It tasted a bit like Chinese roasted pork belly, but the richness is mellowed by the house made mayonnaise. The smokiness of the porky patty was just amazing, the balance with the sesame bun and the arugula... just great.\n\nGordon Ramsay definitely knows what he doing!'

The burger came cooked medium and the smoked jalapeno was really really spicy (the avocado helped calm it down some)  I liked the regular & black sesame seeded bun - it was a tad "doughy", but held together well.\n\nThe onion rings had a good flavor/size/crunch but sadly were a little too greasy (perhaps the oil wasn\'t up to temperature?) the spicy ketchup and ranch they come with were good.\n\nWe ordered the sticky toffee pudding "pops" for dessert and these weren\'t great.  The sponge part (the sticky toffee part) was very authentic, but the "salted peanut" ice cream was not good at all - it really didn\'t taste of anything outside of icy milk.\n\nSo I suggest they serve sticky toffee pudding the "proper" way with hot custard.\n\nThe bill for 2 burgers, one order of onion rings, 3 beers and the dessert came to $80 with tip which honestly left me feeling like it was a little too much (I know we are right on the Strip, but I don\'t think the taste of the food warranted that cost).'

S"I was really disappointed.  I ordered the Farm Burger, medium rare.  It looked nice, the egg was nice and runny, it was cooked correctly, but it tasted bland.  The bacon wasn't crispy, and the burger lacked flavor.  I had been planning on trying a milkshake, but I didn't want to spend $9 and be fooled again.  In Vegas, there are just too many choices to deal with below average food."

S"Best Burger On the Strip. \n\nMy husband and I have tried most burger places on the strip and BurGR is, hands down, our favorite. He always gets his burger completely plain - meat + bun - which is a guaranteed way to find out how good the meat is. BurGR's is fantastic. Juicy, high quality, delicious meat! And the buns are big and fluffy with sesame seeds which I love. They're starting with just a great base here. All of the ingredients are obviously very high quality. \n\nI'm more adventurous and like to try different flavor combinations. I've tried most and The Farm Burger is my favorite. A server we'd gotten to know suggested I try adding avocado and it took it from fantastic to WOW! The Hell's Kitchen burger is spicy and delicious so if you like spicy try that. I love arugula so I tried the Euro Burger but it was just a bit rich for me. Delicious but really rich. \n\nWe've tried all of the fries and the Just Fries are just right. They're the thick kind and are served with 2 different really nice ketchups - curry and chipotle. \n\nI tried the Kale Apple Ceasar Salad which, if you like those 3 items (Kale, apples, a ceaser) you will love! And the shakes are completely decadent. But to be honest, once we'd been a few times I stopped trying any of the extras because a burger + 1/2 an order of fries is a meal! The servings are large and filling. \n\nI noticed some complaints about the wait between ordering and being served. It's true that if it's busy, it can be slow. We don't really mind as the food is so good and clearly made fresh. We treat it more as a yummy dinner out than a quick bite. I think some people expect very quick service with a burger. This is more of a sit down meal. But our solution if we're really hungry is to to order one order fries as an appetizer right when we sit down and order drinks. The serving is so big we can easily nosh on that and still have plenty left over when the actual burgers, and any other items, arrive. \n\nWe keep trying new places and BurGR keeps winning! In fact, I might just need a Farm Burger for dinner tonight!"

S'Burgr is definitely a restaurant you want to try when your on the Vegas strip! \n\nMy GF and I went in the evening and waited a good 30 minutes before we sat at a table. The staff is very knowledgeable about the menu and give great recommendations.\n\nI had the Euro burger with a order of onion rings.  My girl friend had the Hell\'s Kitchen burger and an order of regular fries. \n\nBoth meals were packed with flavor and in my opinion one of best burgers I have ever tasted! \n\nThe only draw back for me is the server seemed a little "cookie cutter" and didn\'t have much of a personality of her own.  More like she memorized what she had to say and just went through the same routine at every table. \n\nWe had a great experience and will be back next time were in Vegas.'

S"Oh Ramsay we expected the best burger we'd ever had, but honestly we've had plenty better burgers out there at far cheaper prices and without the long one hour wait (longer for bigger parties like ours).\n\nThe burgers themselves were just slightly underseasoned, not enough to complain, but not enough to really bring the flavor.  The buns used were too tall making it difficult to eat, and I wasn't a fan of the balance of the burger either.  I had the farm burger (16) and the white truffle fries (11) and a soda (4).  The fries were decent, much better than the plain fries, while the sweet potato fries were a bit too sweet really.  The fries are advertised as big enough to share, but honestly we had a table of 9 people who don't eat that much and we really needed 6 because we finished 5 sets without wasting a breath.  If you have a reasonable appetite you might want to order one just for yourself.\n\nSo yeah not a bad burger, but for $31 + tax + tip for a burger/fries/soda combo I'd expect much better.  On the plus side the service was some of the best we've had."

Unfortunately, the kitchen or server lost our ticket so that was another 30 minute wait for the re-fire.\n\nBurgers were perfectly prepared and seasoned. Truffle fries were good. \n\nWe had to wait another 15 minutes for the server to return with the credit card after paying. \n\nSo . . . service would be 1 star, food . . . 4. It's worth trying out for sure."

It took about 45 minutes for my girlfriend and I to finally get seated.  Once we ordered, it took about another 45 minutes for the food to come out.  We were thinking at least it means the food was super fresh and made to order.  When we finally got the food, it was such a disappointment.  Both our burgers were bland and the fries were horrible.  Our server wasn't really friendly at all, we got a little attitude when asking for regular ketchup.  In the end, I'm still a Ramsay fan, I love his shows but I'll never come back here again."

S"Even though the line was long, we only waited aprox 10-15 min to be seated. Our hostess and waitress were very friendly and nice. We got refills instantly on beverages without having to ask - a HUGE plus. But it took 37 mins to get our burgers and fries. Our burgers were cooked to our asking but lacked any taste, definitely needed more seasoning, salt and pepper are not provided on the table. The tomatoes in my burger were about 1/2 an inch thick, had to remove them so's to get a decent bite, because the burgers stand tall. The fries were equally bland, hardly any flavor and very dry - McDonalds fries win hands down! My husband was upset that we didn't get regular ketchup. We received 3 different flavors, which one was spicy and bitter, one was sweet/hickory and bitter, the 3rd was just gross. The fourth flavor was a Parmesan something-or-other, which was the better tasting of all. The music was really loud, felt like my husband and I were shouting at each other. Overall disappointing considering it's Gordon Ramsey, we expected more because it is Gordon Ramsey's restaurant. Needless to say, we shan't be returning but the experience was fun. Because it was our anniversary dinner date, rather than getting upset, we passed the time making fun of our food."

I walked in sat down read the menu and was torn between two amazing specials that made me drool just reading the words. They had a burger with a fried egg and hollandais sauce on it and an amazing sounding seared blue fin ahi blt with siracha aoli. \n\nHonestly I could go on and on about this meal as it still makes my mouth water 2 weeks later just thinking about it. The ahi blt was by far and away the star and may be one of the best pieces of ahi I have had in years especially on sandwich style preparation. The burger on any other day would be a menu champ but came up just a tad short. \n\nMy only regret is not going back to have another blt for dinner since I don't know when or if it will come around again."

We had a special the other day, a queso panela BLTA and it was the best sandwich I ever had, with a side of chicken coconut curry soup. For beers, the HopKnot and the Raj IPA are favorites, and they have the only Hefe I'll drink. The service has ALWAYS been top notch.

S"Four Peaks is the dominant brewery here in Phoenix. It has a long history, great location near ASU and a pretty good reputation here locally. You can find their beer in other restaurants around town and in the grocery stores as well.\n\nIts a great place to go with a group of friends. The place is usually pretty busy and the eye candy is amazing! Thanks, ASU!\n\nThe music is great. You can tell the owner is a Dead Head. There is always a great mix of Jam Bands playing. Really ties into the college vibe. Nice touch!\n\nThe menu is good for the most part but pretty static. They dont change it up much. They do however have a daily special that is typically not on the standard menu. These offerings are usually pretty darn good and I would suggest giving them a try.\n\nFour Peaks makes good beer. The problem is that they dont make amazing beer. Most of their beers are very middle of the road. They dont really push any envelopes in terms of style or big flavor. They do make a few seasonals that are pretty interesting. Their Pumpkin Porter is a nice treat I look forward to every year. For the year round beers, you cant beat the Hop Knot. It's a solid IPA but again, nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nBiggest complaint: This place seems to do really well. Invest some of that money into an AC system. Its hard to hang out and enjoy yourself here in the summer when its 110 degrees outside. Perfect place to go Nov-April but its brutal in the summer."

S'My favorite brewery in Tempe. The staff is totally friendly and knowledgeable. I love that atmosphere and how the inside and outside seating merge. Some of my favorite beers are the Sunbru and Arizona Peach, they are refreshing and crisp and perfect for Arizona. \n\nWhat is surprising about this brewery is their food is really excellent too. The Bavarian pretzels and spanakopita exceed the expectations for a bar by far. \n\nThe only complaint I have manifested at my birthday gathering on the patio a few months ago. There were roaches EVERYWHERE, it was like nothing I have experienced, everyone had their feet on their chairs and conversation was regularly interrupted by someone screeching. I even felt a few crawl over my feet. Our server was none too concerned as she never acknowledged what was obviously the problem but I chalk that up to how busy the restaurant was, and the fact that they have to already be aware of their little friends. \n\nThis is Tempe where everyone knows roaches are abundant and it was on the patio, far from inside seating and the kitchen so I am far from writing this place off but they may want to consider an exterminator.'

She was kind enough to take time out of her busy day to answer questions and make me feel like I was the only customer in the room.  The food is delicious! There isn't anything on their menu that I don't like. My favorite is their nachos! Get half chicken and half beef, you'll have the best of both worlds. The beers are so refreshing! My favorite is the Oatmeal Stout. The beer is amazing! It's smooth and finishes with a hint of chocolate. It's super creamy! I think what I really love about this place is that they're always playing great tunes. Staff is great, food is great, beer is great, what's not to love?!

The place is packed at night, which most of the time is a sure sign of good drinks and crowd. Everyone is friendly and casual which is soo pleasant for the atmosphere.

Ironically we ended up at Four Peaks (a Vikings bar) on our way back home to Minnesota.  \n\nMy husband loves beer (brews a ton of his own) and especially enjoyed the beer sampler. Trying 10 beers for around $9, yes please!  I don't really love beer so I had a cider and it was exactly what I needed.  For dinner I had the turkey burger with fries.  The turkey burger was standard but the fries were awesome.  I think it was the beer batter.  My husband go the carne adovada and he raved.  I think he may try to convince me to fly back to Phoenix just for that dish!\n\nThe atmosphere was also great.

That was a good move as the crowds were thinner but the atmosphere was still great the the ful menu available.\n\nWe started with an order of the Nachos and those disappeared quickly.....very tasty. My boys loved them! For lunch, I ordered the Fish N Chips. My wife had the Chicken Salad Pita. The Fish and Chips were terrific; very lightly fried with a non-greasy, flaky touch. One of the best examples I've had outside of an authentic British Pub. My wife loved the Chicken Salad Pita which had a nice flavor and spicy finish. I don't normally like Chicken Salad but had a taste of it and it was great.\n\nOne son had a pizza.....boring....but the other ordered the Chicken Enchiladas. These were above average but not in the same category as many of the straight-up Mexican restaurants in the area.

Finally my husband and I visited a couple of times on off peak hours, and it was totally worth it.\n\nI don't think I've ever tried a Four Peaks beer I didn't like, but I particularly recommend the Raj IPA and Kiltlifter.\n\nAs for the food, I really loved the Southwest burger I got on the first visit. Nothing makes me feel like I've wasted a huge chunk of my daily caloric intake more than a burger with a sad unseasoned patty, but the patty here was cooked perfectly medium on the inside with a delicious char on the outside. The jalapeno dressing was tasty as well. The fries were also excellent. I don't think I've ever had beer-battered fries before, but if I were on a stranded island with Four Peaks beer-battered fries trees, I think I could live with that.\n\nAnd although I typically love burgers more than life itself, on the second visit I got a Salmon BLT. I'm probably never going to get a burger again because this BLT was so good. I love salmon anyway, but it still had a balanced amount of B, L, and T, which I can barely ever find on a BLT that doesn't have salmon on it. \n\nIn short, I really enjoyed Four Peaks Brewing Co and I'll be coming here a lot more to partake in their delicious comestibles."

S"I really do enjoy this place everytime I go.  They have a great patio with lots of shade to sit outside and enjoy a cold beer and a meal.  Last time I went, we ordered the Blackened Chicken Nachos (they were pretty tasty, though not the best around by a long shot) and the spinach / avocado dip, which was delicious.  \n\nThe entrees we ordered were also very good.\n\nFish & Chips: the fish was excellent and lightly breaded with their signature beer batter.  Chips were also lightly breaded in their batter, but I personally prefer my fries un-breaded. \n\nBurger & Fries:  Black Angus burger cooked to perfection (med-rare) and was very flavorful and juicy.  Again, fries breaded...\n\nPizza:  I didn't actually try the pizza, but it looked good and smelled delicious.\n\n4 Peaks is always a fun place to stop and at least have a beer or two!"

S"Giving this fine establishment anything less than the requisite 5 stars would be tantamount to heresy of the highest order. I've been here countless times over the years. Most of those times have involved waiting in line to get in, as well as a loud and crowded restaurant on the inside. But, you know what? It never matters how busy they are or how boisterous the clientele-- they ALWAYS knock it out of the park. The food and drinks haven't been less than stellar on any occasion, nor the service anything but friendly. And, the most remarkable part? The food has ALWAYS come out in a timely manner. It's insane, considering the volume they experience on such a regular occasion. I swear to God, they must have robots working the kitchen they're so fast...\n\nAnyway, the short of it is this: Everything here rocks, it's totally worth your time, and if you somehow are in the area and don't stop by, do yourself a favor: put your right hand up in front of your face, palm-side facing you, and bring your face into your hand... Because you deserve it."

S"I don't think I can think of a single bad thing to say about Four Peaks.  Delicious beer (which happily can be found at a lot of places in Phoenix.  Did you know that Wal-Mart carries Kilt Lifter??), and the food... oh my sweet baby jesus I love to eat at Four Peaks.  I positively crave their fries sometimes, and I swear I dream about these chicken roll appetizer thingies they have.\n\nThe place itself is a great atmosphere, service is quick and friendly (with one exception.  We were there with a fairly large group once, and had a terrible, slow, rude, stupid waitress.  But this was completely made up for later by better waitresses and the manager), and I just wish it was closer to my house or work.  When I did work nearby, lunch and beer at Four Peaks was my favorite.\n\nOh and I lied, there is one bad thing... depending on when you go, parking is a major bitch.  But whatever, so you have to walk a little bit, you big baby!  Just go!"

S"4.5 Average rating from lots of reviews tells it all.  This place is as good as it gets.\n\nHowever if you are Mr. Coors light or Bud Light Drinker BEWARE none of that swill is sold at the bar at Four Peaks, just their delicious brews they make.  \n\nThis place is ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS packed, the worst part about it is finding parking, then sometimes depending on the number of IPA's you have finding your car when you leave (just kidding).\n\nThe food is very good.  I am a huge fan of the Salmon BLT but also love their burgers and have not had a bad appetizer either.  Service here is always attentive and friendly and it seems they are all well trained and know the menu, which is a plus when asking questions.\n\nAs far as the beer goes, there is a reason 4 Peaks won a gold medal in this years World Beer Competition, its just that good.  I love their seasonal selections, right now its Peach, and the lines will also agree that the Pumpkin Porter is top notch.  Kiltlifter is probably my ultimate favorite while my wife will sip on their IPA all night with a big smile.\n\nIf you are looking for a quiet place, again this place is not for you.  Its loud, busy and tables are close to each other, but the mix of people in that place is what is fun.  It is probably the closest kind of place you would find in NYC around Columbia or NYU with its mix of people in it.  You will find your normal college kid, your professor type (you know the drunk old guy at the bar) families and old and young professionals.  All getting along!\n\nThis is just a very good place, we always enjoy it!"

S'Busy place on a saturday night but they were able to accomodate our party of 12 within about 45 minutes. While we waited we had some beers at the very large bar they have at the front. Several TVs and not dissapointed the the beer. Hop Knot and the Kiltlifter are two of my favorite brews from this place. \n\nFood: this is my second time back and think it will be my usual when im ever in Tempe. Ordered the Filet, it had great flavor and cooked perfectly, not dry at all. Had the steamed veggies, which were realy good. They dont cook them all the way so they still have a crunch to them which I enjoyed. For apps get the calamari, they are long and larger than ive typically seen. Be sure to dip them in the spicy red sauce, it makes the app!\n\nAtmosphere: this place is packed. But it doesnt necessarily make you want to turn away. The service is great and staff is friendly. Youre in an older red brick warehouse style brewhouse, its a little noisy but as to be exoected for a restaurant this large. Really great atmosphere in my opinion,  unless youre looking for a quiet date night. TVs are in all directions so its a good place to watch the game as well. \n\nOverall 4 out 5 stars...its a solid choice in all aspects, but may not blow your mind. Ill definitely be back though!'

S'This place is definitely a diamond in the rough.  For me and my friends (who have mostly all grown up in PHX), this place is our standard, staple, our Cheers, if you will.  Four Peaks feels like home.  The beer holds its own against any domestic microbrews.  Their constants are worth coming for (such as the acclaimed Hop Knot and Oatmeal stout), but the seasonal really generate the real anticipating locals; the coveted Pumpkin Porters will get tables fighting over the last growler of the season.  Every time I have traveled abroad, this is my first stop upon my return.  No other place in PHX can you get such world class beers for so cheap, superb food to rival any pub (served till 1:00 am daily), and a crowd that makes you feel like family.'

S"Dined at Four Peaks Brewing Co. for the first time last night and let me tell you, it was delicious. The place was pretty busy for a wednesday night but from what I understand thats pretty normal for them. And after my experience I understand why. As soon as we were greeted we were taken to a table inside right next to all the brewers. Cool! I love the art that goes into brewing beers and I think those large silver shining beauties are amazing. \n\nOur server was great. Friendly, assertive, punctual and not creepy. My man ordered the Hop Knot and I ordered the 8th Street. We barely made happy hour by the skin of our teeth. I love restaurants who give you happy hour prices on your drink even if you ordered them at 5:58pm when HH ends at 6pm. Believe it or not, some places out there would ignore your table for two minutes just to avoid the HH. So lame. This scored huge points in my book. For food, we ordered the edamame for our appetizer and the Veggie Pesto Pizza for dinner. \n\nThe Edamame was super fresh. If you've ever had bad or even mediocre edamame, you get it. Its disgusting. I wasn't expecting anything phenomenal but was genuinely happy when I actually wanted to keep eating more of it. The pizza had buttloads of flavor! Artichoke hearts, olives, mushrooms, tomato's, mozarella and feta cheese and pesto. Mmmm. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it and didn't hate myself for eating it after. \n\nAll in all it was a fun time and I really enjoyed the 8th Street beer!"

S'What a great spot to hit up on the first night of a business trip!  Even for a Monday evening, this place was pretty packed, and now I can see why!\n\nThe service was really great and attentive, without going overboard.  Our waitress made sure our beverages were never wanting.  She also did a great job helping out a member of the group that was not as into beer as I am.\n\nSpeaking of the beers, I tried a pint each of the Kilt Lifter and the Raj IPA.  The Kilt Lifter was fantastic, a great example of Scottish Ale, with a great malted flavor and some nice undertones of subtle fruit.  The Raj was a real nice IPA, with the nicely bitter hoppiness that I look for, without being overdone.\n\nFood was also real good, and in more than generous portions.  Great flavors all around that went nicely with the fantasic beers.\n\nOverall - I want to bring Four Peaks home with me, as it is a great establishment that I will make a stop every time business brings me through the area!'

We had a great server and my burger was amazing! The Poppin Burger (I think) has a ton of cream cheese on it, onion blossom strings, and jalepeno slices the size of small children. I was sniffling after the first few bites...but well worth it!\nWe had a bunch of random beers between all of us, with the peach and raspberry being the favorites.

Come in for the beer, but stay for the food.  The chef in this joint is on point, and everything I've gotten to go with my brew has been mouth watering and delicious. \n\nThey release seasonal beers every so often, and will open up with a growler sale where you can come in and buy it to take home.  Also, I understand that they will have lunch specials with things like elk burgers which I really want to try. \n\nI'd say the only down side is the lack of parking, so I'd recommend arriving extra early and parking a ways down 8th street to walk in."

I was expecting to be seated in the main room but that didn't happened. So we moved to the patio. The weather was hot and I didn't notice anything that could help (idk if there were misters but it wasn't that great).\n\nI had a heffeweizer and it got warm pretty quick, but oh well.\n\nThe edamame was good, crispy and tasteful (I always order edamame without salt).\n\nBut the spinach salad was bad. Lack of taste, the spinach was flavorless, the dressing was boring, all in all a bad salad.\n\nMy friend ordered enchiladas that were ok if you overlooked the presentation (it looks gross, pools of grease, it could look like dog food and the metal dish doesn't help at all).\n\nAnyways, bad salad, bad experience and kind of price for what I got."

S'3.5 stars.  I like four peaks.  Its an acceptable destination in Tempe for me.  They have above-average bar food (with slightly above average bar food prices) and obviously good beer.  I\'m a fan of 8th street ale (aptly named after the street the brewery is on) and the peach.  They had this AMAZING seasonal Pumpkin Porter this winter.... *le sigh* So. Delicious. And the salmon BLT is a contender for my "last meal on earth".  The beer battered fries are delicious as well and even their side salad is unusually tasty for you know, a simple side salad.\n\nI don\'t come here very often since it\'s a bit of a drive for me from Phoenix but when I do stop by its during the workweek around 6-9.  Not sure what the scene is like on weekend, I\'d imagine it gets lively what with all the alcohol and sporting events being broadcast on the many TV\'s hanging inside.\n\nThe wait staff has always been prompt and friendly.  The clientele is usually pretty diverse mix of Tempe folks.  Usually very spirited, which is not really what I look for in a drinking establishment but by no means bad and at the very least entertaining.\n\nI get annoyed that every time I come to this place they analyze my ID for like 3 minutes and usually ask for alternate forms of ID.  I understand it\'s a necessary precaution, really, I do, but its still annoying.  Reckon I should update the photo on my ID huh. I mention it just to give a heads up if your photo ID is looking less than accurate. \n\nThis is a good place to come with a group of friends though.  A great spot to get a feel for Tempe.'

We were lucky to have found a spot about a block away so we decided to check out the place.  It was a hot muggy day and we thought some nice cold beers would hit the spot.  We arrived at the front of the place to see about five people standing around at the hostess spot, not one of them said Hi.  I had to say two please and interrupt their conversation.  We got seated in the back and right away the heat just hit me when I sat down.  I started sweating.  No ac, really?  We are in phoenix and people still use swamp coolers?  Anyways I was uncomfortable and noticed everyone was sweating, like beast. I looked around and saw a lot of college students sitting about and thought to myself... geez this isn't where I would go to pick up on someone, everyone is sweating and looks gross.  \nI know this place has some good reviews but nothing stuck out to me.  I love four peaks beers normally, but when my server came with my beer it was warm, not refreshing when sitting and sweating.

I have never hated anything before at four peaks and last night my boyfriend actually said it. "I Hate this, i do not like this at all; it tastes  like chicken from a can" Thats what it tasted like.

S"We met some friends for dinner here last Friday.  Let me start by saying that I'm from Chicago, where parallel parking skills are a must.  If you're looking fora spot that's easy to get into, plan on walking a few blocks!  \n\nWe arrived and were seated right away.  The atmosphere was nice, woody, with lots of paraphernalia hanging around to look at.  You can see the big whatchamacallits that they store beer in at the back of the room. Also, there are enough TV's to catch the game without it feeling like a sports bar.  \n\nMy friends and I are in our late 20's and early 30's, and we did have this weird feeling like we were outsiders.  After about 20 minutes, we realized that we were some of the oldest people in the room!  It wasn't a huge deal, especially since we were there while ASU classes are out for summer, but I'm sure if you went mid-semester, the place would be chalked to the gills with co-eds! \n\nOur server was cheerful, attentive, and checked on us enough without it being overbearingly often.  Food came fast and we never saw the bottoms of our glasses without already having another drink on the way.\n\nWe ordered the hummus and the soft pretzel for our apps, both were tasty.  I ordered the fish 'n chips with homemade tartar sauce for my entree.  The fish was good, but they should buy their tartar sauce, the homemade version wasn't great.  I, not being a tartar expert, can't tell you exactly what was wrong with it, but put it this way...they could have served me straight mayo and I wouldn't have been able to tell the difference.\n\nMi compadres ordered burgers and both enjoyed them very much.  I didn't try them, but I'll take their word for it.  \n\nWe didn't order desert, although the Oatmeal Stout tiramisu dish sounded amazing.  \n\nOverall, a fun experience.  We brought home a growler to enjoy at home and will definitely go back again!"

Go to New Glarus in Wisconsin, hands down, the best brewery in the country.  Yep.  Never heard of them?  Well, you have to go to Wisconsin to taste their product and it\'s worth the trip.\n\nThree Arizona breweries stand out in my mind and my local favorite is hands down, Four Peaks.  Yeah, the food is good and the atmosphere is loud and always hopping.  Four Peaks has a great waitstaff and they are always friendly and cooperative.\n\nI am not a "bar food" guy so, there food is good, but mostly not to my tastes.  I\'ll have the soft pretzels with a flight and then choose a couple of the beers I like most for dessert.\n\nThanks for being in Tempe.  You serve this beer lover well.'

Outdoor seating (with heaters in winter) is a nice option and you can reserve the back area for large groups/parties. In the last few years, they put out a hostess stand and there is a longer wait for seating, but at least you can take the buzzer to the bar while you wait. The parking lot is very small, but you can find a spot on one of the streets nearby without too much effort."

Probably because my best friend works there BUT aside from that this really is the best brewery out that way!  :)\n\nEven for someone that isn't much of a beer drinker they have beers for everyone!  They have the Kilt Lifter, similar to guiness that my husband loves all the way t the Peach Ale which is light and sweet and right up my ally.  They provide samplers to see which one fits your taste.\n\nAside from the beer the food is AMAZING.  I love the brunch they have every weekend.  Enchilada and eggs are my fav so far.  The chicken rolls are fantastic especially dipped in the sweet jalapeno sauce.  The sandwiches are fresh and HUGE!!  The service you get here is one of a kind and the place is so big you ALWAYS have a seat.\n\nI highly recommend stopping by for a brew and chicken rolls to watch a game.

That's a plus. \n\nI ordered their popper burger and sampled 3 beers hoping to order a pint. Here are my general thoughts. \n\nThe burger: great fries, enjoyed the onion strings. The jalapenos bit. The cream cheese was ok and had an unusual texture. The burger itself didn't stand out.\n\nThe beer: I had asked for the Scottish and the Hop Knot. The waitress wasn't sure what the second one was, so she gave a third. That was also good, though all three seemed light weight on the tongue. However, the waitress returned midway through my burger and by then I didn't feel like a pint. Timing is everything."

I went for the Portabella Veggie Beer Bread. I have to say that the title made me think it would be a portabella mushroom sandwich. It\'s actually a wrap. And I\'m not sure how it\'s "beer bread"; it just seemed like a tortilla. But it was good anyway. \n\nDefinitely go for the fries, no matter what. They are beer battered and delicious.

S'Four Peaks is a "MUST VISIT" for out-of-towners. Tempe is full of chain-restaurants, and Four Peaks is the one really special place in town. Housed in one of Tempe\'s oldest buildings, the vibe is unique and causal (and is not overrun with fraternity guys, despite being so close to ASU\'s campus). \n\nGreat beer, great food - and I don\'t mean "great food for a bar", I mean "This is some of the best food ever." I\'ve never had a bad dish, and they have daily specials that are actually quite sophisticated. The only complaint I have is that the inside tends to smell. They make all their beer in house, and sometimes that yeast smell just permeates the place. The patio is great, and my preferred place to sit. \n\nParking is a problem. If you can\'t find a spot on the street, you can try behind the building. Both spots require serious parallel parking skills, though! \n\nI think it is the best bar in Tempe, and one of the best in the Valley.'

It's as if they personally hand picked each hop precisely to go into their beers. This is the Ferrari of beers at a Honda price.  About 8 or so different beers year round with one seasonal rotation.\n\nEnough about the beers, onto the food. Most brewery's have either good beer or good food. This place has both. Or should I say amazing beer and amazing food. I ended up ordering the nachos for a starter. Hands down one of the best plates of nachos i have ever head, and I consider myself a bit of a nacho connoisseur. The nachos are smothered in chicken and cheese. Then they bring you another plate with a dish of tantalizing jalapeno black beans and all the other nacho toppings you can imagine. Also ended up getting the BBQ pizza, enchiladas, and a slow roasted/smoked pork dish. \n\nBring your friends here, a first date, your parents, your boss, your siblings, or just about anyone else you would like to impress.\n\nKeep Eating, Cheers!"

The food and the drinks more than make up for it. I don't get it when guys go to Hooters to watch a game, and pay $20 for poor quality wings (I can buy the same at Costco). Plus, If I want to see 1/2 naked girls, I'd go to a strip club. \n\nI only come to a bar to watch the game, have a couple of beers, and eat good food. For bar food, Four Peaks has the best nachos, awesome grilled chicken beer bread, tasty artichoke dip, and a great house hamburger. They have enough TVs for the game you are looking for. They have a cool patio to chill, Plus, how can you not like their beer!\n\nThe one thing that is annoying is that there is this bouncer that spends 10 seconds looking at my ID (he bends it a couple times to check for authenticity)  to make sure I am the person on the ID. I've been there so many times that he should know my name. But, he keeps doing it. I think I need to go to DMV and get a new ID now."

With a huge outdoor patio and even more seating inside the warehouse style brewery I can't imagine you'd have too much trouble finding a place for a small party to sit on most nights.\n\nWe ordered a pitcher of the Kilt Lifter, which seems to be famous down here in the Valley.  I can see why it won so many awards!  It has a great malty caramel sweetness and is very smooth.  It would be a great pairing with one of their burgers.  I also enjoyed their 8 Street Ale for those interested in a lighter beer.\n\nWe also decided to start with some of their Arizona chicken rolls, as my friend had all kinds of recommendations from friends to try them.  I couldn't believe how big these things were!  They're basically small fried burritos stuffed with chicken, anaheim chiles, and cheese.  The sweet jalape\xc3\xb1o dipping sauce it comes with is ridiculously good!  These are best split amongst 4 people.\n\nWe both loved the atmosphere and can see it being a great place to catch a game or simply enjoy some great beers on the patio.

S"Well, I rolled up around 5pm and there was plenty of street parking available. Seems like a bunch of famous Phoenix/Tempe restaurants have been plopped down in residential areas - very strange. Happy Hour runs to 6pm only, so I slipped in three craft beers (why are they not letting you get $1 off seasonal beers either?) and was hoping for food specials as well. This is not the case here as only beer is discounted and only by $1, but some kind of food should be included in happy hour deals. After a  switch of seats at the gigantic bar, I ordered the Blue Light Special burger cooked well done and loaded with blue cheese crumbles and average bacon. The bun was really good and the beer battered fries were another highlight. Those things are crispy, crunchy and don't taste deep fried like most battered fries have tasted in the past. Some guy next to me ordered a giant portion of chicken fried steak too that looked good. Burger was top notch (claims to be fresh ground), bartenders were all friendly and I have no parking complaints, so this was a good experience for my debut here."

S'I think the fanfare for Four Peaks is obvious...and for good reason. Brewery right? So, this means "bar food"? WRONG. The food is to die for. I get the Salmon BLT religiously, the BBQ Chicken Pizza is awesome, the Nachos are HUGE (add the blackened chicken and thank me later), and the specials are usually damn good also. \n\nI\'ve probably been here 40 times (conservative number) and while the service can be lackluster, I cannot give them less than 5*. When I say the service is "iffy" it really depends on the server. Some are amazing. One guy I\'ve had multiple times frankly does not give a $hit. And other times, they can just get overwhelmed (this place get packed wall-to-wall, so I can understand some lapses). \n\nThe beers...AMAZING. If you want to get tipsy, go straight for the Raj IPA. A tasty, hoppy beer that will get the job done. I tend to like bitter beers like IPAs, so I stick to the Raj, HopKnot, and 8th Street. I do like Kiltlifter (probably their most popular beer) but it can start to get too sweet after a few. \n\nOne thing many people fail to mention; order a glass of water. I know water doesn\'t sound impressive, but they pour the same distilled H20 they use in their beers and it is the best water in Arizona. Just a thought.'

Well hubski shows up and tells them all what's what. Now we've got a friend in Steve forever.\nEverytime we are there, he takes a break to chill with us. We got a tour of the facility. This is cool- the Kiltlifter is supposed to be a Scottish beer. Four Peaks actually has biologists balance the water to match the chemicals to Scottish water. The same with the Hefe- the water matches German water. This is all so that we can have the most delicious and authentic beer possible.\nFour Peaks is a laid back place, great beer, good people-watching. Bar food."

S"4.5 stars.\n\nFour Peaks is everything a Brewery and Restaurant should be!\n\nI came here for a late lunch before the ASU football game this past saturday. Yes, the place was packed, but we were luckily seated within ten minutes.\n\nAs far as beer goes, this place can do no wrong. Everything I sampled was very well balanced and had a great flavor. I highly recommend the pumpkin porter for a unique beer that is very fitting for the Fall season. Both IPA's are also top notch.\n\nWe were rather hungry so we started with the nachos and the chicken rolls.\n\nThe rolls were extremely rich and had great flavor. The jalapeno dressing gave the dish a nice spice. Be careful to not fill up on these because they are rather large and quite filling, but DAMN good.\n\nThe nachos were huge! Chips, cheese, beans, tomato and jalapenos. The chips were extra cheesy and everything worked well. Needed avocado though..\n\nFor my entree I decided on the southwest burger. The burger consisted of 1/2 pound beef patty cooked to a perfect medium rare. The usual lettuce and tomato. A green chili with that same sweet jalapeno dressing I had with my rolls. I also added my friends chipotle ranch which went beautifully with the rest of the accompaniments.\n\n Overall the burger was pretty darn good. Granted it wasn't the best burger I have ever had or a taste revelation, but pretty great for bar food.\n\nOverall I was very pleased with four peaks. My friends hyped up the place like crazy and I was not disappointed. The food was certainly a step above regular bar food, but not quite as unique or adventurous as some of the gastropubs I have sampled in California in Chicago. If you are in the mood for even just a beer or some delicious and unique bar food, do not hesitate one bit to check this place out."

The thing I loved the most was the crust. It was quite possibly the best crust I have ever eaten, and I don\'t say that lightly. Crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and a slight twinge resembling sourdough. \n\nSeating is limited so we took our slices out into the foyer and sat at a large wooden table. Their also is a foosball table with glass over the top so you could potentially sit there, have your slice, and play a match or two. If you do sit outside of the place don\'t be surprised if people start asking you where the secret pizza place is.

It feels like a pizza speakeasy amid so many trendy restaurants on that level inside Cosmopolitan, but well worth the mystery hunt to get there."

S"A hidden pizza place that serves delicious pies til 4 in the morning?  Damn I love Vegas...\n\nEven if you don't party or stay at the Cosmopolitan, it's worth it to exit the club around 3:45 and get to this pizzeria for a mouth-watering slice or two.  The White slice (ricotta and what tasted like truffle oil) was by far my favorite, followed closely by the classic Pepperoni.  Sister got the veggie and wasn't as enamored (or drunk) as I was, so what does she know.  \n\nCan't wait to come back to this spot next time Vegoos has gotch'ya girl feelin loose"

S"I haven't had pizza in the longest time ever because my diet's pretty low carb, but in vegas it completely went out the window! Anybody that personally knows me, knows that I'm one indecisive girl when it comes to food cause I wanna eat/sample everything. We were staying at Aria and they have Five/50 pizza bar there which I wanted to try, but I also wanted Secret pizza. Luckily, my bf was sweet enough to run to both places to buy slices and bring it back to the room at Aria for us :)\n\nNormally the line is crazy packed out the door, but luckily my bf didn't have to wait long. We ended up getting the white pizza w/ sausage and mushrooms. I was surprised the pizza was still nice and warm when he got back to the room. I was a bit scared at first because all the reviews kept saying it's super oily, but this definitely was NOT the case for us! Compared to Five/50 pizza in Aria, Secret Pizza was way better!!\n\nI've had really good pizza in NY and the pizza here was a NY style big slice (big, foldable, and not too much sauce). It held up the toppings and everything nicely. The crust had the perfect crunch and texture. They were also generous w/ the toppings here especially the sausage. I mean you can see the whole sausage link on my pizza. I really liked the cheese on here too, it didn't have the stinky cheese smell. The roasted garlic spread smothered on the white pizza was sooo robust and good!! The white pizza consisted of various cheeses as well, the ricotta stood out and tasted fresh.\n\nFYI: We came here once after clubbing and got lost trying to find it. No wonder it's called secret pizza lol.\n\n-It's located at the very top floor of cosmo (3rd) where all the fancy restaurants are. Look for a hallway w/ vinyl CD records and you'll find the hidden gem!\n-It's more of a go in & grab a quick slice place, there aren't chairs for you to sit"

S"Overhyped & overpriced!\n\nFOOD\nThe pizza is NY Style thin crust. It was OKAY, not spectular enough to be worth $5 a slice! I've had wayyy better pizza for half the price. IMO costco pizza even tastes better.\n\nWhite pizza - Just okay. Really heavy-handed on the ricotta. There was just thick globs of it scattered everywhere.\n\nCheese pizza - Average. Kinda greasy\n\nMushroom - Average\n\nSausage & pepperoni - Probably the better one of them all. It actually had some flavor to it. \n\nSERVICE\nSUCKED! Pretty much you walk up to the counter and the person takes your order. The lady who helped us was rude. Honestly seemed like she HATED her job. Just gave us her frowning face & asked us what we wanted. The pizzas were just laid on the counter in front of her and it didn't even really look all appealing. But since we made it all the way here, we might as well order. She only warmed up two out of our 4 slices. So our food was half warm, half cold. \n\nAMBIANCE\nThis place is on the 3rd floor of cosmopolitan near the Blue Ribbon Sushi place. But there are no signs mentioning the pizza place. At first, we couldn't find it and had to ask someone where it was. The lady just said to walk down the long halfway & it'll be there. The place is pretty much just a counter with some side counters and chairs to eat but that's pretty much it. Nothing memorable.\n\nDefinitely won't be back. Come on Cosmopolitan, I would have expected better dining places!"

I love pizza, so when a group of friends couldn't decide on what to eat, this place was the perfect spot.\n\nThere's no signs, just an open door leading into a picture framed hallway. You look up at the simple menu. Immediately we noticed NO RANCH. Dang!! It's ok though. The pizza was still good without it. It's about $5 a slice for a plain cheese pizza, but with 5 of us, a couple dollars more per person got us a fresh whole pie. We opted for the white, which comes with mozzarella cheese and ricotta. It was quite tasty!!! A little but on the greasy side, but that's what happens when you order a pizza that's ALL cheese. \n\nIt was a solid pizza spot, but for the pricing and the fact that there's hardly anywhere to sit, I'd still rather have Grimaldi's.\n\nP.S. This would be an awesome spot if I was drunk!"

The white pizza was nice and garlicy.  The mushroom pizza needed something to give it a bit more kick.  The crust on both pizza were crispy thin.  $5 a slice was a little steep,  I would like to see them offer some sort of combo meal including a drink but maybe most people just order whole pizzas and take them back to thier room.  The staff wasn't super friendly - I asked what kind of pizza they had by the slice and the cashier just pointed to the pizzas.  I had to ask again for her to tell me the toppings.

I was behind them, and the guy taking orders/making pizza looked me over and went on to the next person. I figured I'd have my order taken at the cashier, but no dice. When I got to the cashier, she asked me what I'd ordered, and when I told her nothing yet, she looked to the pizza guy. Dude had the gall to say I'd cut in line? Maybe he missed the fact that a friend of mine ahead of me handed me a water bottle as they were paying for their order. Not sure what his deal was, but my business is better spent elsewhere. Took them about an hour to make the pizzas, too- way too long for anyone impatiently waiting to get their grub on. I'm sure they'll make their money off of other customers coming back from clubs drunk.\n\nPS The pizza's mediocre, but insobriety makes everything better, doesn't it? Not worth the buck."

S'For any drunk club-goer in the wee hours of the night, this place is a dream come true. I went to Vegas for work recently and arrived to the hotel at midnight after many delays and hadn\'t eaten dinner. I was able to run downstairs and get a piece of pizza in 15 minutes. This place is tucked away on the third floor across from Marquee - look for a long hallway with vintage record covers.\n\nI got a piece of the white pizza ($5) - obviously, no tomato sauce, and lots of cheese (almost too much cheese). There was a ton of mozzarella cheese, ricotta cheese, and a garlic oil. There was a bit of a pool of garlicky oil on the top of my pizza, and I had to pick around some of the mozzarella cheese. I loved the NY crust - it was not soggy and was both crisp and chewy. If you\'re at the club and have found "someone special", you may want to avoid this white pizza since you\'ll have garlic breath for the rest of the night. The white pizza was great, and I was sober and hungry, so I\'m sure if you\'re inebriated, it will taste even more delicious. \n\nI came back the next day after going out and drinking a lot and got the Supreme pizza. It was good, but not as good as the White pizza.\n\nGreat for a late night slice of pizza after drinking, or when you need a quick bite to eat. They have a cooler of free water & cups so you can hydrate after a long night out.'

S'Favorite slice of "normal" pizza I have had in Las Vegas!  And I have lived here for five years!\n\nDubbed the "the secret pizza place" it is located on the 3rd floor, situated next to the elevator, in a brown hallway. \n\nWe waited 30 minutes for a slice of pizza.  Why the long wait?  People were walking up and ordering whole pies and they couldn\'t keep up with the demand.  Hence the -1 star.  They should be constantly making pizzas for the customers wanting just a slice.  When we finally got up to the front, they only had a pepperoni & mushroom pizza.  There are two things in life that my husband hates: mustard and mushrooms.  But since they said it would be at least another 10 minutes before a cheese or pepperoni pizza came out, we each grabbed a $4 slice and walked out the door.\n\nWe found a seat near the pool table and each took a bite.  DELISH!  Crust has a good chew, good flavor in the sauce and the cheese is fresh.  Pepperoni and mushrooms were tasty too. My husband even ate the whole thing! The slice was definitely a good size and I was full after just one.\n\nIt was so good that I have been thinking about it all day today.\n\nThis will be my go-to place in The Cosmopolitan for a cheap dinner! :)'

The 30-40 minute wait became 1.5 hour. We had to call 2x and get the run around. Finally when the pizza arrived, the delivary guy just stood around expecting a tip. I don't know what is going on in Vegas but I don't just tip for the hell of it. I earn my money... so should you. \nAny-hoo after the food actually came ALL of us gobbled it down... and none of us really remember that with great food, may come crap service."

S'Located on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan, I\'m not sure how much of a "secret" this place is anymore. Well at least for those of us who live here. I\'ve been here a few times now and each time have really enjoyed my experience. It\'s nice after a show or having met friends on the Strip to just run in and grab a slice. Most of the time that\'s all I\'m really needing anyhow.\n\nOnce you get down the hallway you walk into what looks like any slice pizzeria I\'ve ever been in. You wait in line, order up a big slice of whatever they have made in the last 10 minutes, and find a little counter space to enjoy pizza and wine/beer. \n\nEvery time I\'ve been here they I\'ve gotten through the line quickly, the staff  has been friendly, and the pizza has been good. It is a bit pricey for a slice but you\'re on the Strip so that\'s what can be expected. If you weren\'t being overcharged then it wouldn\'t be a Las Vegas restaurant. \n\nAll in all I like this place and will probably stop in again if I\'m dragged to the Strip.'

Joe answered was super nice and helpful .. told me to head there in twenty min or 35 for a whole pizza .. was worried about time since there was some traffic so opted for four slices.. got there in ten .. I luckily the pizza hadn't come out of the oven yet b.c there was quite a line .. paid for four slices $20 .. waited ten min .. inhaled a slice and they packaged three for me to go ... with transportation these four slices costed me $15 a piece .. but I still love this pizza and so worth it .. and I don't even like pizza \n\nTried to find white pizza in Seattle .. pfft ..

We had to ask for help to find this place...no wonder we couldn't find it.  There's no name posted outside and you have to go through a long hallway.  The line can get pretty long, so the wait of course is long, and you have to wait even longer (30-40 min) until your pizza is ready.  Whole pizzas are nearly 30 bucks.  What a rip.  Since it was pricey, I was expecting good pizza or like the best.  During our wait, my friend and I got water from the water dispenser.  That thing is so slow.  Someone needs to adjust the nozzle.  Just to fill a cup, you have to wait about a minute...how ridiculous is that!\n\nMy friends and I ordered a pizza with sausage, dried tomatoes, and cheese.  We hung out outside for a long while...\n\nFinally, when our pizza was done, we ate it and wasn't amazed.  It was at least fulfilling to our appetite.  We ate it at the couches and was approached by a promoter who had just moved to Vegas from London.  Nice fellow...  He's never been to this pizza place before so we gave him a slice to try.  We even gave a slice to our taxi driver when we made our way out.  Maybe they'll decide to drop by this place sometime.\n\nIf you don't mind waiting, why not try this place out at least once..."

S'I remember VERY LITTLE of how, when, and where exactly the "Secret Pizza" place was, but I do remember the delicious aftermath.  After finding the "secret" hallway, we stormed in like gangbusters, asked the nice pizza man what was "good"  to which he rightfully suggested his own "meat lover\'s" version -- a seemingly off-the-menu creation concocted of pepperoni, sausage, peperoncinis, some other kind of meat, and some other stuff I\'m failing to remember.  It was SO DAMN GOOD -- the not-so-soggy thin crust was absolutely what we needed, so much, that it got the stamp of approval from the two Manhattanites I was...ahem...dining with.  This WHOLE PIZZA easily fed 3 inebriated people or would feed about 37 models, 4 normal people or 15 people on a diet.  It should be noted that the two latter classes of people really don\'t belong in Vegas anyway.\n\nThere is minimal seating inside, but you can take your pizza "to-go" and park it on one of the Cosmo\'s luxurious couch seating areas in the hall right outside.

I still don't understand why the line is so ridiculously long.\n\nI ended up getting a slice of white pizza with mushrooms and sausage on it. Nothing extraordinary here. Cheap piece of dough, scattered pieces of meat, and barely any substance. Honestly, it tasted like it came out of a frozen pizza box you get at Grocery Outlet. I've had some amazing NY style pizza. I've even had out of this world vegetarian NY style pizza, which is rare for me. Secret Pizza just didn't cut it. \n\nWhat makes it worse is it's $5 a slice.

S'After 700+ reviews in a year and a half of being here, is it really fair to call this "Secret" Pizza?\n\nOkay okay, maybe the moniker is because the place is unmarked, tucked away down a hallway next to a sushi joint, and you really will miss it unless you\'re looking for it. But it\'s still the worst-kept secret in the Cosmopolitan.\n\nIt\'s thin-crust (but NOT crispy) pizza and for slices, you\'re limited to handful of choices - cheese, pepperoni, and white pizza. You have more flexibility for toppings if you order a whole pie, but beware the wait. It took us upwards of 35-40 minutes for two pizzas, and save for a half-and-half topping on one of them, we didn\'t really order anything complicated. I was, however, extremely grateful for the FREE WATER!\n\nThe white pizza is the standout here. So much garlic and olive oil that it will leave your paper plate soaked. It was a little on the soggy side because of all of the oil, but at 2am, it\'s exactly what the doctor ordered. If you\'re wearing insane heels and you\'ve just finished a night of going big at one of the clubs, you will want to sit on the couches outside of the place to relax and eat.\n\nThere is also a Donkey Kong arcade game inside the place. It\'s a great way to pass the time, but beware the Kong. It will suck you in, beat you down, frustrate you, tease you, and leave you with a hole in your heart. Have fun.'

And she was like "You ordered 3 pizzas! It\'s not Pizza Hut!" That pretty much shut him up! It was hilarious! My pizza was so good! It was hot too! The crust was super moist and flavorful.

Big slices of sausage, oozing cheese.... when I took my first bite, the crispiness of the crust.. it was heaven. Got me and my sister wanting another slice. Next time we come here, definitely getting the whole pie cause its 5 dollars a slice and between me and my sister getting two slices each, it was already close to the price of a whole pie. Fountain drinks here are a tad overpriced especially when they serve it in those little red party cups."

S'I will always remember Secret Pizza as the place where a prostitute stole my pizza. Well to be fair, it wasn\'t intentional. She was standing in line with her "John" right behind us and thought the slice they pushed out was hers instead of mine. She tried to offer to give it back to me, which was nice but I had to politely decline since I have no idea where her hand or mouth touching the pizza had recently been.\n\nJudging by the crazy long line, Secret Pizza is probably the worst kept secret in Vegas. The establishment is located on the third floor and has an obscure entrance right in between 2 restaurants. It\'s not hard to spot because you just have to spot the crowd.\n\nThe pizzas are good but don\'t take my word for it. I was pretty inebriated and extremely starved when I consumed my slice. I just remembered really enjoying my new slice of veggie pizza that was not touched by any ladies of the night. The guy at the counter even gave me one free slice extra of pepperoni since I had to wait longer for mine.\n\nIf you want a whole pie, you can actually call it in and walk right up to the counter to pick it up. That should be handy if you\'re in a large group and are able to call in as you leave the club to head here.'

So after many failed attempts and countless run in's with people asking where i can get a hold of this pizza i found it down a long narrow hall way. Now if you have ever been to NYC this is as close as your gonna get to NYC pizza at least in Las Vegas, simple; thin crust and very flavorful! Atmosphere is normally drunk ass people wondering around outside the 3rd floor of the cosmo; this place is hidden in the back down a long narrow hallway by all the high end restaurants very hard to find unless you ask someone and even than it took me awhile. Service is fairly quick get in, get your pizza and get out but when its the end of the night 4-5am its packed so be warned !!

S'This is your classic NY-style pizza which means limited toppings (at least for the slices) for the folks on-the-go, thin, fold-able and is considered a snack (unless I order a pie).  Prices are a bit outrageous because for 1 topping in NYC, a slice of pizza would have cost me $.99 or $1.99 at the very most (whereas here it cost $5) but I have to admit that the "secrecy" about this place is kind of cool and even though I\'m an impatient girl, the line was enjoyable.  \n\nIf you need a drink, get a beer otherwise opt out for their extremely slow water dispenser (cups available by the cash register) because the bottled water and sodas will cost you just as much as a beer.  \n\nAfter a relaxing eat, I walked, and accidentally kicked a guy\'s Corona.. I felt horrible and please note that I wasn\'t intoxicated.  Not one bit.'

I got the white pizza, which had ricotta cheese and a nice garlicky flavor to it. I would get this again in a heartbeat.

S"Monday, October 3, 2011Secret Pizzeria at Cosmopolitan, Las Vegas \n\nI will start this review with the following disclosure: The following Pizzeria does not exist. It has no menu, it has no website, it has no signs advertising a family meal deal. It is also not down a long hallway lined with old music album covers on the third floor of the Cosmopolitan Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. It is not one of the best deals on the strip. It is also not the Best Pizza on the Strip. I HAVE KEPT THE SECRET.  Now onto the food review... for the best pizza and best pizza deals in Vegas you need to find the secret Pizzeria at Cosmo. The cost is almost two dollars less per slice then any other pizza joint on the strip ( including my other favorite at the Wynn) and the super thin crust , fresh taste and general New York ambiance just can't be beat. Although thin , the crust is still sturdy enough to bend without breaking and strong enough to hold any toppings. Speaking of toppings... unless you order ahead of time ( is there an actual number to the place?) then you will be having your pizza topped with whatever the chefs whim is. There is no formal menu.  On this day Simone and I had our choice of 5 different pizza pies. We both choose for our first slice portabello mushroom pizza with red sauce. With meaty fresh thin sliced mushroms, sweet fresh tasting marinara creamy mozzarella cheese and a crispy blistered crust this one was a winner. Savory till the last bite it leaves you wanting more... so I obliged. This time when I went back to the counter looking me in the face was a white pizza with fresh roasted garlic, Ricotta Cheese and Olive Oil. This one may have been better then the mushroom. The crust was sauce less and had even more crunch. The garlic was sweet, the Ricotta Creamy and slightly melted and the Olive Oil was the icing on my pizza experience.  \nThe Pizzeria does not seem to offer any sides and I didn't ask because none were needed. They do have fountain drinks and beer. Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes can be found at the stand up bar that you can eat on. Without any other choices, The pizza definitely stands alone (although three days later we went back and tried a cannolli for dessert and that was delicious as well).\nNew York thin crust pizza is what its all about here at The Cosmopolitan, and these guys are the best at it."

S'I wasn\'t impressed.\n\nDuring the start of a girls weekend in Vegas, we set our sights on Secret Pizza early on.  Once we "found it" (super easy to find), we walked down the album covered hallway to discover minimal seating and zero ambiance.  The pizza is about as good as an average NY pizzeria (which is to say, it\'s better than most places =P), so if you\'re looking for a slice of home, that is what you\'ll get.  Nothing too special, definitely solid, but this stop was definitely made for post Marquee fuel.  If you want better pizza spot with more ambiance, head over to the Aria and hit up Five50.'

S'Its kind of funny that\'s its called Secret Pizza because its not really a secret anymore. I was in Vegas over the weekend and had some down time to explore the strip and I thought that I would check this place out. I have heard about it from numerous people so I was like "awwwwweee yeeeee I must check this place out". I came here on a Sunday around 7 p.m. and there was no line, thank goodness. I wasn\'t too hungry so I shared a slice with my significant other. We got the mushroom because they were out of the white, and we didn\'t really care to wait for it to be made. A slice was about $4.50 and was a decent size. To be honest, this pizza was just alright and nothing too special. By no means am I a pizza connoisseur, but I have tasted better. Maybe the fact is that I just came from New York and had the best pizza of my life! But this place is just mediocre. I can see how it\'s a hit because it\'s located outside of the club, but most definitely just OK. Its kind of cute and touristy to find it though so I say what the heck, if you are in Vegas give it a try. Maybe it will taste better when you are severely inebriated.'

Luckily we went during the day at around 2pm...so we missed the lunch rush and didn't have to contend with the after club drunkos.  At first I had no idea where I was going because as you walk down the corridor all you see are pinball machines---so at first I thought I was going to a game room, but then just as I turn the corner---I am greeted by a happy go lucky pizza dude.\n\nI tried the white pizza and hubby had the meat lovers---they were both very good and surprising not super greasy.  We both finished our slices---completely.  The white pizza has 3 or 4 different cheeses including ricotta, mozzarella, and some other cheeses that elude me right now--but drizzled on top if some sort of garlic oil.  Yum!  The meat lovers had sausage and pepperoni.  I didn't want to wash it down with any lively libations or pop, so just asked for water---which was surprising right next to the register at a cold water cooler.  The pizza dude was very nice and offered us up cups of ice.\n\nI will definitely stop by here again on my next visit.

S'This place is literally a secret.  It\'s not on the map or directory at the Cosmopolitan Hotel nor does it have a sign above the entrance saying "Secret Pizza."  It\'s on the 3rd floor near the elevator.  Enter a long hallway and the place is literally a hole in the wall.\n\nI came here with my boyfriend, and I had the impression that the pizzas would be more unique.  The pizzas are pre-made and each slice is popped in the oven for a few minutes as you order.  We asked the cashier what makes this pizza so great, and she replied, "It\'s just good pizza."\n\nFor $5, we shared one slice of the white pizza, which is topped with ricotta and mozzarella cheese.  I never had an orgasm in my mouth from pizza before, and needless to say, my boyfriend and I should have gotten our own slice.  After devouring that slice of pizza, we pulled out another $5 and ordered a slice of sausage pizza.  That was also very delicious, but I prefer the white pizza.\n\nIf you come with a large party, it\'s best to purchase an entire pizza to share since it\'s cheaper that way. \n\nDominos and Pizza Hut just don\'t make the cut anymore.  This place is truly a treasure serving just really good pizza.  I wish there was another location in Orange County so I can fully satisfy my pizza cravings.'

S"It is by no means the best pizza I have ever had, nor is it the best pizza by the slice, but I personally love the idea that they don't advertise, and you have to walk down a little hallway to get it. \n\nThe novelty of this place is what earns it four stars. Knowing about this little place makes me feel like I'm part of an exclusive club (or at least a club that 187 other yelpers know about). \n\nI tried the mushroom and white pizza. Both were delicious thin crust style pizza. The mushrooms on top my pizza were particularly delicious. And at $3-$4 a slice this is probably one of the best deals in Vegas, and definitely the cheapest meal that I saw in the Cosmopolitan."

S'I don\'t know how much longer this place can be a "secret" because it is seriously good! We came here one late night from a friend\'s recommendation, whom we thought was trolling us the entire time, but it turned out that this place exists! The place was pretty packed. We waited for about 45 minutes to get our three whole pizza orders. They were sooooo worth the wait! They were NYC style pizza (we tried the Chicago one too but it wasn\'t that good). The slices were big and the cheese was oozing out of the pizza with every bite. It might be because we were hungry too but everyone in my group thought the pizzas were excellent! We\'ll definitely be back here on our next trip to Vegas!'

S"Went to Vegas this past weekend and one of the highlights of the trip was hitting up this unnamed (yet not much of a secret) pizza joint in the Cosmopolitan Hotel. Luckily, I've got a friend out there that my wife went to school with so we learned about it almost instantaneously. \n\nThe walk up into this place is pretty impressive. The Cosmopolitan is actually one of the nicer hotels in Vegas, and you don't actually get forced in the casino the second you walk in. It definitely seems to cater to a 20 somethings crowd, which I think is very appealing for people that my age bracket, but I can imagine might be tedious for people that are a little bit older.\n\nSo, on to the pizza itself. The place is small and down a fairly long hallway. They've got some pinball machines and a counter where you order and pay. No seats, but there's a little lounge back out in the hotel, so it's really not  a big deal. Their pizza is greasy and has a good crust. \n\nIt's fucking expensive. Seriously, I don't usually complain much about price with food, but $4 for a slice is absurd. David Chang isn't making my fucking pizza back there, and even if he was I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have the balls to overcharge on a slice. \n\nBottom line, it's definitely good, and I'm sure it's absolutely fantastic if you're shit faced. It's worth probably once, but unless you're right in the area you shouldn't go out of your way."

S"The pizza was good, but I don't know what all the fanfare is about. Maybe I wasn't drunk enough, either. \n\nThis place is very deserving of the name. It's so well-hidden that it's easy to miss if you don't know it's there. You go down a dark, narrow hallway to find this hole-in-the-wall type place. D\xc3\xa9cor is nice, like the rest of the casino. It has a cute subway vibe and is very clean. \n\nI had a pepperoni and mushroom (red sauce) slice, and my hubby had a spinach and feta (white sauce) slice. The crust was thin and chewy. The pizza tasted good, but was a little on the greasy side. \n\nYes, it's tastier than your typical Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns, Costco, or any chain pizza joints. However, $5 for a thin slice is too much. $30 for a whole pie is out of the question. There are so many better deals in Vegas. \n\nI've tried it now (and it is good), but I'm not willing to shell out that much money for a slice of pizza. We left hungry after eating a slice each, but we didn't want to spend another $10 there.\n\nPricey, for sure.  I don't care how high the rent is - it's not Disneyland or a baseball game. Geez. Not a winner in my book."

S'This pizza joint is somewhat obscured by its hallway of album covers. Located on the 3rd floor where all the restaurants are concentrated, it was easy to find since there was a long line propagating in the "hidden" hallway. I was somewhat annoyed that I had to wait for the pizza, but the pizza was decent. You can tell that the dough is quite fresh and had an authentic Italian taste to the crust. If you can avoid waiting in line for this place, it is even better. They have a water dispensing machine by the cash register, but that device does not work properly as it barely trickles any water. You are better off purchasing a drink than relying on their water dispenser. They had some vintage pinball machines in this pizza joint, but they were non-functional. Also, my pizza was somewhat cold so if you are getting slices of pizza, make sure to ask them to reheat your pizza so that it is piping warm.'

S'As an ex-New Yorker living in Arizona, the lack of good pizza has more than once nearly drove me to buy an airline ticket. Then I heard about the Cosmopolitan\'s "Secret Pizza" recommended by some friends in AZ. And frankly, since one grew up in Syracuse and the other in Ohio, I wasn\'t hopeful.\n\nBut I gotta tell all - this is THE PLACE! It is truly NY pizza - at least a "good" there!  And thousands of miles closer. 4+ hours by car or less than an hour by plane.\n\nI hadn\'t been a regular Vegas visitor for the nearly 20 years of living out west, but Secret Pizza will do it.

S'This pizza joint has a pretty cool environment. It has bit of a retro feel with the pinball machines and video arcade. There is limited seating and most likely you\'ll be standing. \n\nI ordered the white slice and a "vegetarian" slice (olives, peppers and mushrooms). They were superb: thin and crispy, yet chewy. The pizzas were flavorful! I had to deduct one star because there were pretty big chunks of cheese on the white slice, which looked a bit revolting and unpleasant when I took a bite. However, this won\'t deter me from coming back and I\'ll definitely be trying the other slices.'

S'My former fiancee is a chef here. He and lots of our other family members told me to check it out. I am so glad that I did. It is Awesome, yes with a capital "A"! There are several reasons that this place is great. One, they are inexpensive. Two, they are open late night. Three, they have some awesome topping combinations. Four, you can even pre-order if you are a guest staying at the Cosmo.  Fifth, and the reason for my 5 stars, this place is one of those hidden gems in the busy mess that is the Las Vegas strip!  I love thin crust pizza late at night with the last few dollars in cash that I brought with me to the club for the night. How could you not want something to warm your belly for the trek back to your hotel room, whether it is at the cosmo or another property. And really, you need something to stop the sloshing that\'s going on in your tummy, all that cran-vodka and patron with a twist of lime. Some things that you must know about this spot are, the location is hidden. You will find NO signs. This place may be considered pricey but keep this in mind, they are open til the break of dawn, the slices are huge and their toppings are premium!  I just can\'t go to Vegas without a stop here.

S"Yup... It's a New York Slice. While this type of slice if commonplace in NYC, they are few and far between outside of NYC. On the left coast I would only rate this place and Mulberry of Beverly Hills as being the 2 pest places to score a NYC style slice. \n\nOften imitated but never duplicated... A thin, doughy crust, with a little crispness, easy on the cheese, and a sweet basil tomato sauce. \n\nA real NY pizza expert will start with a slice of cheese. This one made the grade. I was also a fan of the sausage and banana pepper.\n\nThe ambiance - Full of drunken Californians mostly. There will be some women walking barefoot and carrying their shoes. Possibly a couple natives from the land of vegas. Feels much more sterile than a NYC place, which isn't necessarily a bad thing."

The pizza was good, but not great.  Unless you're from Fargo, ND.  You can take the pizza place out of New York, but you CAN'T TAKE THE PIZZA!  It is acceptable for Vegas, even good for Vegas.  But it ain't New York pizza. \n\nStill, if you happen to find yourself at the Cosmopolitan - a place I absolutely adore! - and you're on a budget, you can get a slice or two and be perfectly satisfied.  Budget is a dirty word at some of the other restaurants up there on Floor 3."

Within the busy experience of Vegas, this place offers a retreat back to a familiar ma and pa pizza shop near your normal hometown or New York (tho I've never been so I can't testify). It's a very humble place where you can grab a delicious slice or whole pizza for very reasonable prices for being in Vegas let alone in the heart of the strip. \n\nI had a slice of the Sicilian pizza which is this super thick, not even deep dish pizza because it's one of the thickest pizzas you may have seen. Tasting it, it has a lot of crunch to each bite but with consistent buttery dough inside. The complexity of the herbs and cheeses they use is what make it really special and definitely worthwhile to try. \n\nIt's perfect for people partying out late because it's a quick place to get in and out, offering such a delicious guilty pleasure, while being open til 5am!

My friend wasn't hungry but we both got 2 slices of pepperoni pizza anyway. We got our food pretty quickly. My friend thought the shaker he grabbed had parmesan cheese in it but it was actually garlic powder that he just dusted all over his pizza. I did the same thing but only because I like the taste of garlic. It was soooo gooood. The crust was perfectly crisp and not soggy. They're pretty generous with the toppings. It's about $5/slice but it's worth it.\n\nIt's a tiny place with a few chairs and by a few I mean about 4-5 chairs.

Mushroom, green peppers, and pepperoni! \nTook them about 25 min to prepare it, and the pizza was huge!!!! I mean I can eat, but that was really big... \n\nThere wasn't enough mushrooms on the pizza which was a little disappointing to me! and there was one string of the green pepper on each slice! Good amount of cheese and ok amount of pepperoni...... It was waaay too oily for my taste... I had to dab it down with napkins to soak up the oil...  The crust was amazing though... we ended up eating half of the pizza and took the other half to go... at night while I was having my red bull vodka, I was taking the crust off of the rest of the pizza (which no longer looked appetizing) and it still tasted great... \n\nOverall the place is ok!

Someone told us about it so that is how we happened to find it.  \n\nWe first attempted to order on a Saturday night...well...Sunday morning after Marquee Night Club and were standing in line when I was plowed over by a very intoxicated Australian man.  After gaining my composure, he plowed me again.  Before I killed someone, I made the decision to come back later.  So my point here is...if you go late night, your experience may not be so pleasant as this place attracts the overly intoxicated/drugged.\n\nMy second attempt, which was late on a Sunday night/Monday morning, was much more pleasant.  The pizza guys aren't very friendly and I am pretty sure not one of them cracked a smile.  The girl who was taking orders, etc. ,though, was quite pleasant and tolerant of the late night clientele.\n\nThe pizza is delicious.

The place is cleverly hidden (almost like a speakeasy) and much more low key than the other the Vegas venues. I ordered the ricotta with sundried tomatoes and my boyfriend got the sausage and peppercini. The toppings are robust and the dough is amazing - full and crispy! It was just delicious from the tip to the crust. Moreover, the guy behind the counter is super friendly, and served our slices within minutes. He also didn't let me pay when I was trying to pay for our meal - that's how you could tell he's a real gentleman! He also told us that this place is only known through word of mouth, and it really does live up to its reputation!\n\nThere are also a couple of pinball machines, which make a nice touch to being just a pizzeria.

Well, I went on a Tuesday at around 1:45 in the morning and stood in line for 30minutes. Not too shabby. I wouldn't say that they were extremely busy and they seemed to be well staffed too. Thing is, it was DIRTY. The parmesan, oregano, chili flakes and garlic powder was scattered all over their counter tops as if they were having a party. I don't mind dirty when you're slammed and short staffed but there was absolutely no excuse for dirtiness that night. Especially since there was an employee stuck to her phone in the corner. She didn't even TRY to crouch down so that no one could see her. \n\nNot to mention the fact that the guys there didn't seem too enthusiastic about being there. I know that I wouldn't want to be at work at that time in the morning but, come on. At least be a little pleasant? Anyway, if I didn't have to consider their employees they would've been a solid 4 and a half stars.\n\nDon't let my review scare you though. Pizza dough was crisp and the small burns that it had was still enjoyable. There was a good amount of cheese and, was perfectly melted. Pepperoni had that juicy yet still crispy feel. Their Blanca slice was OK. Nothing too special but you definitely see and taste the ricotta. \n\nI would definitely go back since the pizza's great. I just hope they step up their customer service."

They have PBR on tap and serve it to you in a red keg cup. It made me feel like I was in high school again.\n\nNow that we are home my wife won't stop talking about this ridiculous pizza.\n\nAmaze balls go eat it now and thanks to yelpers for bringing us there."

S'Hands down best pizza in Las Vegas and in my top 3 best pizza places of all time. Seek it out and eat it. I loved the plain cheese with garlic and onions..sprinkle on some oregano/garlic salt/crushed red and magic in your mouth. Bonus-they are open late...like really late 3am-5am ish depending on demand. March 2012 we stayed in the Cosmo and went exploring the 3rd floor for a snack. We would see people in random places enjoying (really enjoying) a slice of pizza. Something about h the pizza and the people eating it put us in the mood for a slice even though all the other places looked great as well. O.k....where is the pizza coming from? While looking for this pizza joint my eye caught a glimpse of a pin ball machine at the end of a hall and I wanted to check it out. Low and behold it was the pizza place. We got a couple slices and fell in love. I didn\'t see signage anywhere for a name but assumed it was too new for a name? Later that night we wanted to order a whole pie to bring to our room and couldn\'t find the place on the Cosmo TV directory. I said "Its like its secret or something"...my hubby called the desk and asked them and he said "yeah it has no name..it sa secret..glad you found it" I think its a very cool and mysterious concept. Anyway he connected us to their phone and we ordered a whole pie for our room....we also each had one more slice as we were getting in the cab to go to the airport to fly back home. Anyway...go you will enjoy it :)\n\nIf I could give 4 1/2 I would only because none of their offerings (at-least they weren\'t yet) are organic and that\'s a bummer for me. However its vacation and I loosen up a bit.'

Coming off the elevator just turn right and head through the decorated hall full of vintage Italian record art. Slices are enormous and the "pie" slices are beyond thick!

S"Everybody knows about this place by now so it's not all that secret. It's one of the best late night grub spots next to getting Earl of Sandwich or a steak dinner from Ellis Island. And if you are done partying at Marquee you are most likely to end up here.\n\nThe first time I had their pizza I just bought whatever slices were available and it was good. It was cheesy and salty and the oily just melted my paper plate. Exactly how I wanted it. My most recent venture to Secret Pizza we ordered 2 whole pizzas to go. The wait was almost an hour, but when we got it that pie was gone in less then 5 minutes. It is just that much better when you have it hot and fresh.\n\nIt's cheap and it's open late. What more can you ask for?"

S"All of my drunken nights on the Strip seem to end up at Secret Pizza. For the longest time I wasn't even sure if the pizza was really as good as I thought it was due to my inebriated state. I have ate there a few times since then sober and it really is DELICIOUS! This is a super fun place to take friends from out of town or show off your Vegas insider information when you're on vacation.  They mainly sell yummy/gooey/cheesy pizza by the slice and beer. So if you have had a few drinks stumble your way up to the 3rd floor of Cosmopolitan for some pizza. Just don't be the guy sleeping up against the wall drooling on himself."

S"It's a nice little change-up off the beaten path and it's a little refreshing to find a quick bite to grab something to eat that isn't all stuffy and overly priced. For being in the Cosmo, if you want something quick and good, yeah I could see its high rating, but I wasn't five star amazed. Upon first bite the pizza was chewy, the sauce was the right amount of tang, and I do have to admit that it is one of the best pizzas by the slice in Las Vegas ...but that was upon first bite. After those first couple of bites, the bread and crust was burnt and charred.\n\n I tried three slices: regular cheese, ricotta cheese, and cheese with beef slices (not sausage, some other type of beef). The regular cheese was greasy enough for me to use up the entire napkin dispenser and the crust was crispy black at the ottom so 1 out of 10. The ricotta cheese was a 10/10, if all the slices were this good I would definitely give this place a better rating. The beef slice was good, kind of what you would expect so 6 out of 10. The employees were nice, it was cheap, and like a lot of other people I'm a fan of its location, album decked hallway and close proximity to the pool table and dominoes board but the pizza really was just a little off. I may have come on a bad time and I should give them another chance but still I would have to say that I would never go out of my way to the Cosmo just for the pizza but I'd have it if I happened to be at the Cosmo and craving pizza."

S'Secret Pizza is good. Thin crust, freshly baked and a simple menu. This place really was secret! We had to ask for directions to get to the place. Since we went at 3am when all the drunk clubbers start to stumble out in search of food, the line was pretty long; 30 minutes. So maybe this place is not so secret anymore... We waited at the end of a dark hallway covered in old record covers and loud music. I certainly enjoyed the casual atmosphere, giving me a break from the usual extravagant atmosphere of Las Vegas. \n\nWe ordered the 3-topping pie ($26 for a large size). Pepperoni, mushrooms, and ricotta. Made to order thin crust. It was delicious. Definitely flavorful, without too much sauce, and not overwhelming. My friends and I kept the leftovers and ate them for breakfast the rest of the weekend! Great pizza place on the Strip.\n\nFor reference, If you have ever been to Home Slice Pizza in Austin, TX, I would say Secret Pizza is 1-2 steps down from that.'

S"Do yourself a favor and order a whole pizza instead of getting 1 or 2 slices!! $25 for a whole pizza vs. $5 for just a single slice? I think we all know what you should do. Leftover pizza always tastes good anyways. This is a perfect place to go at 4am when you have the drunchies, as long as you don't mind waiting in a long line.\n\nAnywho, be prepared for some gooey and greasy goodness in your mouth! The pizza slices are huge and their toppings are yummmmmy. My favorite is the meatball. \n\nBiggest problem is that you sometimes have to wait 30-45 min for a whole pizza, which is what happened to my friends and I last time. I'd say it's worth the wait though!\n\nIn terms of trying to find this place, go to the third floor of the Cosmo and it's near the Marquee entrance! If you see the pool table and chairs to your left, the entrance will be the right. You'll see a hallway that has a bunch of cool photos/album covers on the wall and BAM, you're there :)"

S"I thought this was pretty overrated.\n\nI was really hungry so I ordered a white pizza slice and a mushroom slice. The mushroom was pretty solid, but underwhelmed me. The white pizza that everyone was raving about was okay - it was a bit bland and I had to douse it in pepper to make it a little more interesting. It was also waaay too greasy! There were puddles of grease on top of my slice.\n\nMy boyfriend had the white slice and the Sicilian. He thought the Sicilian was too meaty (in a bad way), and also too salty.\n\nWe left feeling pretty fat, lol. All the regrets when we went to XS that same night -___- Definitely should've only ordered one slice each, or skipped out on Secret Pizza altogether.\n\nThe crust was pretty good, but nothing to write home about. Definitely one of the better pizzas I've had, but it's way overhyped. I'd probably come back for some drunchies, but otherwise, I'd skip out.\n\nAlso, $4 for a red solo cup of soda?! Rip off :("

S'The Cosmopolitan hotel is one of my favorite upscale spots to stay in Vegas. It seems as you walk through it everyone is dressed to the hilt in their finest Vegas outfit. Groups of women with their fancy skirts and guys over sprayed with cologne and funky shirts. You know the routine everyone is in Vegas Mode standing in line for the exclusive clubs like Club Marquee trying to bribe the doorman to let you and your friends in. If you give your brain a second to clear itself out you will notice people walking around with cheap paper plates and a huge slice of pizza. At first I didn\'t even notice but I kept seeing this. It was odd seeing people holding $20 drinks in one hand a slice of pizza on a cheap paper plate in the other hand. Finally, I asked the huge security guard bouncer dude what is that and he points towards a hallway that looks like a bathroom hallway in the mall. No sign and not even a clue whats down the hall I walk down this hallway and at the end a Secret Pizza place with a bunch of what looks like hand made pizzas being put in the giant oven! Suddenly I felt transported from Vegas to my old hole in the wall "The Pie" pizza parlor from college when I went to the University of Utah. It took me back I mean way back!

The waft of crusty bread and pizza sauces permeates the halls and the lobby, marketing it's own original advertisement!\n\nIt's your typical Pizza Joint, Pies laid out in front with giant stacked ovens in the back; lines of people ordering and paying at the register.  The interior is remarkably chic; Carrera marble counter tops and other beautiful finishes make this the best dive to grab a cheap eat!\n\nI was unfortunately, unable to help myself; a slice of Cheese and Pepperoni + Sausage somehow got onto my plate.  The Pizzas were just right; perfect crust-almost buttery it had both the texture and flavor that makes it an undeniably New York Pizza.  The Pepperoni Sausage was super yummy, and I can just imagine this would be the perfect place for after hours dining.\n\nI had to take a pic of my favorite Pizza condiments: Parmesan, Chili Flakes and Oregano,  missing is Garlic, my frenemy (love the taste, hate the after effects of lingering garlic in my mouth and breath)"

It took about 45 minutes.\n\nWe ordered the white pizza.  The crust is thin and holds up well when folded.   The crust was crispy on the bottom and had a slight chew to it.  The crust was perfect.  I would like a comforter made for my bed from this crust.\n\nThe pizza was topped off with a perfect melody of garlic and ricotta.  \n\nIf someone stole my car and left me 2 of these pizzas in the parking spot, I think I would be happy.  \n\nLater that night I dreamed I was in bed with Selma Hyeck.  She was wearing a white tank top with no bra and my boxer shorts. We were watching Married With Children laughing having a good time.  I was eating a whole white pizza from this Pizza Place With No Name.  She reached inside the pizza box and tried to grab a piece.  I quickly moved the box from her reach and said "My Pizza."  Then I kicked Selma out of bed, and said "go sleep on the couch CRAZY!"  She apologized and slept at the foot of the bed.\n\nIn reality, this place gets a lot of attention because most pizza joints in this town suck!  With that being said, The Best Pizza in Las Vegas.'

S"Thanks to all the great Yelp reviews and the fact that it was close to our hotel, we decided to try the Burger Bar. It was late when we went in for dinner, about 11:30pm or so. The restaurant was fairly empty, I think there were about 2 or 3 other tables that were occupied. Our waiter was helpful and seemed to be very busy. \n\nThe burgers here were so-so, nothing great but I've had better. My husband had a lamb burger which was nice, mainly because it came with spicy ketchup. The sliders I ordered were ok. They were a little dry, but not bad. I asked for some ranch with my fries and it came semi-frozen. We also ordered the Salted Caramel Milk Shake, which was excellent as was my husband's Mai Tai."

S"Sliders are the size of a dollar pancake. You'll pay $17 for a smattering of junk beer with subpar ice cream in it.  Another $17 for a good, but heinously, disgustingly overpriced hamburger. Are you paying for atmosphere? Certainly not.  This place is effectively in the middle of a mall. You're paying for Vegas real estate and getting what is, in the world of gourmet hamburgers, pretty darn mediocre food. Save your money for something useful. This place is criminally overpriced for what you get.  They'll charge you for every single add on."

S"My wife and I came here for lunch while in town for our honeymoon. The place was fairly crowded, but we chose to sit at the bar (I never mind doing this at a burger place, because the service always seems to be faster). My wife had already grabbed sushi earlier, so this meal was all me. I spotted the Spicy Lamb Burger in the bottom corner of the menu, and was not disappointed. The combination of spicy ketchup, perfect medium rare lamb, so thick my wife had trouble taking a bite, and the soft ciabatta bun (most places have ciabatta that's too crunchy for me), made for a wonderful lunch. The fries were done well, but not superior to other fries I've had. I was so full from the burger that I forgot to order a Nutella shake for desert. Our bartender was friendly, we talked Halloween costumes (my wife had just picked up a sailor outfit and tutu at Frederick's, right across the way from Burger Bar). My only complaint is that I had asked for a Coca-Cola, the only have Pepsi, so I ordered a Sprite and was brought... a Pepsi. Barely a complaint at all, I didn't bother correcting the order, but a tiny bit irritating. The food came exactly as ordered however, so it was a good experience overall."

S'I was recommended this place by my brother-in-law who actually came here 3 times during his last visit to Las Vegas because it "was that good".\n\nAfter a brief stay at Daylight (the Mandalay Bay Beach Club), my group came here to grab some lunch. Burger Bar is located inside the Mandalay Bay Shoppes (it\'s sort of in the middle of things so be prepared for some walking).\n\nThough without a reservation, we were quickly shown to a booth inside the restaurant upon arriving.\n\nService was superb. Our waitress was super attentive, fast, and kept our waters/sodas refilled throughout our stay. \n\nI ordered a custom burger, choosing the Kobe beef option ($17.50 just for bun and meat - lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onion are served on the side), and grilled onion (which was about a $1.00 upcharge). I chose to get my burger cooked medium rare and that was that.\n\nWhen the burger arrived, it did not disappoint! It was probably one of the best burgers I\'ve ever had - simply tender, juicy, and wonderful with each bite to the last. There was no need to add cheese or anything fancy to this burger - just make it medium rare and have some onion and you are set.\n\nThough definitely pricey, Burger Bar is an awesome eatery and I look forward to returning my next visit to Las Vegas.'

S'Needed pre-game food before hitting Marquee and since we were staying at Mandalay Bay, we had room credit for food & beverage. My bf & I decided to try out burger bar because of the great ratings, but was disappointed\n\nWe got to the restaurant and placed our order there to bring back to the room. I decided to do a custom burger with just kobe beef patty on a ciabatta bun with lettuce tomato and red onions. Also got sweet potato fries \'cause what\'s a burger w/out fries?!\n\nHonestly, the fries were better than the burger. I remember finishing the whole box of sweet potato fries. They weren\'t too oily and were crispy. The burger was such a shame. Patty was overcooked and it\'s "Kobe" Sure didn\'t taste like kobe beef though. It was so dry and lacked the fatty flavor that I normally get from Kobe burgers at most restaurants. In addition, there were no juices coming out from the patty, that\'s how dry it was.\n\nDo yourself a favor and get a real burger at Gordon Ramsay\'s BurGR'

S"Truly outstanding burgers and a great selection of beers\n\nThe best burger in Vegas at a reasonable price.  Truly stellar meat - I chose the mid-grade USDA prime 'Naturesource' - combined with a great potato bun and fresh toppings to make a perfect, perfect burger.   It didn't hurt that they knew how to make a 'rare' burger - it was warm yet still red inside with a nice char on the outside.  The skinny fries were hot and crisp and the beers were excellent - an ale and a fairly obscure stout.\n\nThe place is often packed - I chose to eat at the bar instead of waiting for a table.  I'm usually a bit leery of eating at the bar....but the bartender was excellent.  She was obviously used to people eating at the bar and knew how to give sufficient attention to someone needing both food and drink.\n\nAs the evening wore on (I was waiting for a late show) I tried the pepper jack cheese shots.  I still don't know how much I liked them - they were crispy on the outside and nicely spicy but the inside consistency was kind of like a cheesy, potato-y, croquette.  I bit weird...yet yummy."

S'I was here 4 of 6 nights, 1 night appetizers, 3 nights burgers & fries. Given that I went 4 times, I obviously like this place. The buffalo burger was excellent: moist, juicy, and properly seasoned. The lamb was good, perhaps too much cumin for my taste, but I definitely preferred the buffalo. The complimentary tomato, onion, pickle, and lettuce was always of excellent quality.\n\nI always had ciabatta rolls, which stayed intact but yet had an easy to chew consistency. I always had my burgers with smoked gouda or cheddar cheese. My sides were regular or sweet fries and spiced ketchup. Definitely get the spiced ketchup, which is so much better than the Heinz variety. As usual, I ordered wheat beer on tap for drinks.\n\nThis place is not cheap. My individual tab ranged from $33 - $43, including tax & tip. But this is the strip and the burgers were some of the best I ever had. Normally I would balk at paying such prices, but I accept that the combination of location & quality mandate this.'

S'First off, we both enjoyed our meals. She had a veggie burger with a fried egg and marinara while I had the angus with avo an Gouda. They were both great and the marinara was super good. However the reason I am giving it 3 stars is because my  girlfriend spent the night with what seemed to be food poisoning. Besides her burger we shared everything else she ordered. With only one night in Vegas it really stamped out our night. We were also driving back home to Oregon the next day. So instead of making the trip in one day we had to get a room for next night due to her not feeling well. The experience in the restaurant was awesome however the repercussions of her veggie burger was extremely unfortunate.'

S"Don't bother with this place.  You will pay a pretty penny for a subpar burger.  I had the Kobe burger with cheddar. Sweet potato fries. And a nutella milkshake.  The burger was overcooked which always bothers me, as the meat loses its flavor when it is burnt.  I like Kobe burgers and this one tasted like nothing more than a middle of the road restaurant burger.  The sweet potato fries were nothing to write home about either.  Just a note, I got my burger on a ciabatta bun and I would not recommend this, as it was too dry and really took away from the burger.  \n Chef veggie burger with buttermilk zucchini fries was also pretty blah as far as the burger is concerned, but the zucchini fries were pretty good, these I would recommend.

Sounds amazing but it would take a lot for me to pay $60 for a burger. \n\nWife and I had the beef, which was good. Then we ordered the sauce sampler. Mind you this a Hubert Keller restaurant so you know it's going to be good. There were 5 sauces that were all amazing. They are great for the burgers as well as a dip for fries. \n\nWhat really topped off the meal was the buttermilk onion rings. They were flavorful and delicious.

Ordered the Burger Bar Sliders so that we could try three different burgers. One was Angus, pretty good, very basic. A little dab of mayo and mustard and it's perfect. The next was the bacon burger which was my least favorite out of the three because the patty was a bit dry and not as flavorful. The last was the onion burger and I think this is the reason that makes Burger Bar so popular. The patty was so tender and moist, one bite into it and it was oozing with juices. The caramelized onions enhances the rich flavor of the beef, my mouth probably said oh em gee! If you get the chance, order it with sweet potato fries to top it off!"

As the tram was pulling in to Mandalay Bay, I saw the advertisment for Burger Bar.  We figured we would check it out as it was there & not a cab ride away.  We got there before it opened, checked out the menu & decided to stay.  When it opened, we decided to sit at the bar.  On a Friday, the restaurant was full within 20 minutes.  We took our time, ordered a beer sampler before lunch.  Both ordered build your own with the Kobe beef and potato buns.  I went simple with smoke gouda & the chipotle aoili, with sweet potato fries.  Husband got the peppercorn sauce, avocado & american cheese with skinny fries.  Medium rare.  Very pink in the middle, but the meat was so melt in your mouth my husband (who likes things a little more well done than I) didn't care.  The sweet potato fries were the best I have ever had.  The staff did not rush us, even though there was a bit of a line forming & every seat was taken.\nNext time we will split a burger & try a shake - they looked too good & you have your choice of spirited or not.\nAlso, the pickle spear is a perfect dill.\nSee you in April!!"

S'Burger Bar is where we head to after a Mandalay Bay concert or after drinks at the Foundation Room. \n\nAt BB You can choose to eat your burgers from booths, tables, or at the sit down bar. Despite all the seats, BB does get crowded, especially during lunch, dinner, or the weekends. This place has TV screens everywhere, in every booth, along the wall at the sit down bar, and a few others placed throughout the place. It\'s more like a sports burger bar...I like seeing ESPN on the screens, I\'m a guy, it\'s in my DNA! The crappy thing I don\'t like is that they pump music through their speakers and since music is loud, people also speak louder. Don\'t expect to have a nice quiet conversation with your date or friends...this ain\'t the place for that.\n\nThe menu is simple. You can pick one of  their set menu items or create your own burger. Reasonable priced menu especially for the LV Strip. You can choose from different meats...Black Angus, Country Natural, American Kobe, & Buffalo. For you other people not looking for meats...they have a veggie burger, chicken, salmon, or turkey. Then you can dress it up with whatever veg, cheese, or sauces, on their lists. And you can get your burgers with fries (fat, skinny, or sweet potato), buttermilk Zucchini fries or onion rings, & beer battered jalapeno pickles (never tried these). I usually keep it simple: Kobe beef on a sesame seed bun with grilled onions & spinach, with sweet potato fries or onion rings, & a $7 chocolate shake (yes I did just order a $7 shake!). The wife likes the Surf & Turf- black angus burger, grilled half lobster, & asparagus. They also have a $60 Rossini Burger-kobe, foie gras, black Perigord truffles, on an onion bun...pretty steep for a burger but if it floats your boat-eat it.\n\nThey also have a pretty good selection of beers, wines, and cocktails. Beer is beer everywhere except when it comes to the prices and BB alcohol prices are higher than other similar food joints. We always pass on the drinks. \n\nFor the most part we\'ve had decent service. But we do avoid the lunch and dinner crowds because those are the times we\'ve had hit or miss service. It\'s mayhem trying to wave down a server during a weekend dinner rush. And it seems like they play extra loud music to help to drown out the customers that need assistance LOL! Seriously, you can hear ESPN, loud music, people talking loud just to hear themselves...and that\'s going on all at once. BB has the unmistakable ambiance of a high school cafeteria.\n\nOverall, BB is fun burger joint where you can create your "OWN" masterpiece of a burger. We like that they offer you many different selections of toppings, but beware on your add on\'s, they can definitely add up. You could easily be eating a $20+ burger. So bring your earplugs and just text away with your friends...and enjoy your burger.'

Husband ordered the Kobe burger with some avocado, no cheese and I went with the no preservatives selection on a sesame bun with jack and lettuce.  I am not sure what went wrong with this combo, but the bottom bun turned to paste/mush and was really gross.  I was scraping it off to be able to eat the burger and was not eating especially slowly where I could see this happening.  He liked his burger a lot, and the fries were very good (as were my zucchini fries and the sauce sampler we got) so I only took off a few stars.  It's hard to give more than 3 stars when your main item falls so short.  The basil and truffle mayo sauces were my favorite - both were better on the zucchini than the ranch it came with!  Skip the white BBQ and the spicy ketchup, they are forgettable.  I even put the truffle mayo on my burger at some point to try and salvage it, but no dice."

S'For out-of-towners staying on the south end of the strip, Burger Bar is a nice alternative to the way-overpriced "fine dining" establishments and moderately overpriced, boring cafes that line the casinos. They have an excellent beer selection as well as a huge list of "a la carte" toppings for your burger.\n\nFor God\'s sake, do not order the Kobe burger. This is one of my pet peeves about most of the restaurants on the strip. The beauty of Kobe (and really, Wagyu, which it can\'t even touch) is in the perfectly marbled texture of the meat, which is completely ruined by grinding it up into burger. It\'s a stupid gimmick that apparently works very well as these burgers are so prolific on menus here. It\'s hard to find a restaurant without them here, so I guess I\'m in no position to protest them all. Whatever.\n\nI like the idea that I can get something as ridiculous as truffles or foie gras on my burger, but I never would. Choice of three different types of bacon PLUS prosciutto is very nice, as well as three different types of fries (skinny, fat, and sweet potato) covers all the bases.\n\nIt\'s still overpriced, but it\'s quite convenient and the food\'s not bad.'

S"You can't go to Las Vegas without eating a over top and overpriced burger and there ain't know better place to do so than Hubert Keller's Burger Bar. I like this place because it has a old school/new school burger joint look to it. They have a huge beer list and my server allowed me to taste three different beers before choosing the one I wanted which was nice. I went the Rossini Burger which is the grand daddy of all the burgers they serve. It was named after a XIXth century Italian composer whose love for fine food was legendary. Its Kobe Beef, sauteed foie gras and shaved truffles all on a onion bun with a side of a rich brown madeira sauce. It comes with a choice of fries, I chose the sweet potato fries, and a choice of a desert burger, I chose the PB&J!  \n\nThe burger was absolutely amazing. I ordered medium and it came out perfect. It was very juicy and the flavors all pair well with each other. The truffles add a very nice earthy taste to it as the foie gras adds a nice richness to it. Surprisingly I was able to eat it with out it coming apart. The fries are were very good as well. I'm a huge sweet potato fan and like how they have different type fries to choose from. The PB&J desert burger is peanut butter mousse, raspberry jelly and sliced kiwi's all in the middle of a warm glazed donut. Its VERY rich but VERY good. The kiwi adds a nice refreshing taste to it which it needs with the richness of the peanut butter and the donut. \n\nThe Burger Bar has a wide-range of choices and will satisfy your burger craving while in Las Vegas. I will be back to try some more of Hubert Keller's crazy burger creations."

So instead of hitting up the beach, My friend and I decided to go to this place.\n\nThe service was really good. Our waitress was very attentive to us. As much as I want to like this place, it's not even that great. \nI had the hubert keller's favorite burger which was like 22.00 bucks. The meat was really tender and the spinach and sauce made it taste better, but for 22 bucks, I was really expecting it to be like amazing, but the meat wasn't that flavorful to me. I was really disappointed in my burger. Maybe I just had too high of an expectation.\nMy friend got the chicken breast burger, and it was a pretty good burger but for 15 bucks, I was kind of expecting the chicken to be more juicy and tender. My friend also said it's kind of plain so she took my sauce for my burger and put it on hers. The sweet potato fries were pretty good but it's the same everywhere else so it's nothing really special.\nI also brought back togo my friend an american classic burger and she said it wasn't even that great for 15 bucks.\n\nMy friend liked her burger and her experience here, but as for me, I dont think I will ever be coming back here. I've had better burgers for the price of $5."

The BF really wanted to try it, so we decided to give it a go. Yet again, he beat me with food choices (how does this always happen to me?!?!). We both built burgers with the naturesource patties. He got bacon, pineapple, cheddar, and spicy ketchup. He was very happy with his choice. I, however, was kind of disappointed with mine. I got caramelized onions, the red wine reduction sauce, and cheddar. The sauce, which I thought would be amazing because it was supposed to be like a 'signature' sauce and it cost like 3$ was totally bland! I was counting on it for a lot of flavor, and it totally disappointed. The burger was fine, but nothing special. We also split some sweet potato fries, which were good, but, for 30+ dollars,I wouldn't come back here again."

S'I saw that this was a restaurant owned by acclaimed celebrity chef Herbert Keller.  Recently he was featured on Top Chef Masters.  This was an economical opportunity to check out his culinary offerings.\nThe place is located in the small mall that connects Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  It has sort of a grill and bar feel to it.  Super casual.  \n\nTheir menu includes a build your own burger option, build your own milkshake and build your own sundae option.   Great it you are super picky, not good if you are indecisive!  I tried the top sirloin burger and added a few fixings.  I noticed that they had about everything you could think of to make your perfect standard to gourmet burger.  I was in the mood for a Hawaiian burger, but noticed they have everything BUT teriyaki sauce.   Bummer.  When I got my well done (by choice) burger, I noticed that the bun to meat ratio was a bit off.  "Where\'s the beef?"  I would have preferred a flatter patty so that it covers the span of the bread.  My first bite included everything but meat.  Verdict.  It was good, but not entirely great.  I could have settled for an In-N-Out burger.  Ouch.\n\nService was excellent.  You gotta love Vegas for that reason.    There are TV\'s at each booth which is set to ESPN and a few huge TV\'s at the bar.\n\nTIP #1: If you like mayo, ask for the chipotle aioli.  It\'s a hint of smoky, garlicky pepper aioli (mayo).  Surprisingly tasty.'

S"One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  It's always a great place to take folks who don't get to Vegas very often and don't know where to venture out to eat outside of their hotel.  \n\nThe Burger Bar has something for everybody.  They have a list of menu items they've put together as well as a create your own burger side.  Basically, you pick your bun, burger, cheese, vegetables, other toppings, and fries.  They have all kids of cheese, three or four types of bacon, many veggies, several types of onion, and even some uncommon items such as fois gras.  They have steak fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, seasoned fries, and zucchini fries.  You can pile it as high as you want.  The burgers are big and as delicious as you want to make them.  \n\nThey even have a few dessert burgers where a doughnut serves as the bun.  Originally, they only had one and it wasn't anything great to me.  Since then, they have added a few more options that I have yet to try.  Their milkshakes are delish as well.\n\nI usually make my own burger, but last time I ordered the sliders and they were very good.  It was a perfect choice when you're not hungry enough for a big burger.  The sliders are three mini burgers that are each different.  I'll definitely order that again.\n\nTime and time again, this is a great place and always has something for everyone, carnivores and herbivores alike.  I'm not sure about the vegan folks though...  They do get super busy and I would highly recommend making a reservation.  Roll up your sleeves, head to the Burger Bar and see who can build a better burger!"

The Kobe/Wagyu beef burger is my favorite. A good way to get it is on a potato bun, caramelized mushrooms/onions, swiss cheese & peppered bacon.  I highly recommend the zucchini fries as a side. \n\nIf you have room for dessert the sundaes and milkshakes are great but the only time I have been able to try them is when i only eat half of my meal and take the other half to go.'

But come on, its VEGAS! People come here to do it big, have stories to tell, and just live a little on the wild side. So excuse me if I wanted to try this monster out.\n\nOne word, amazing, this burger still haunts me. No joke, its been 2 days, and I'm getting hungry now just thinking about it. Make sure to drizzle the truffle sauce all over (truffles being the most expensive thing in the Rossini) ugh.... sooo good.

S"Energetic atmosphere, service is okay but not great, the fries are nice and crispy & delicious, but my surf & turf burger was definitely not great.  Interesting combination to put asparagus, lobster, and a [perfectly cooked but underseasoned] burger together on a nice soft bun but how you can charge $25 for a burger and not even include a condiment is beyond me.  You have bottles of ketchup, mustard, and A-1 in front of you - which one of these would go well with a surf & turf burger?  None.  This thing was dying for a nice aioli or something which would have made it less dry and a whole lot more tasty.  Alas, no luck - and from a French chef no less where you would expect aioli to be readily available for the fries and everything.\n\nThe restaurant is crazy busy but has 2 long bar seating areas as well as quite a few tables.  They do a great business and the vibe is good, I'll try to return at some point but it just annoys me when restaurants take good food and ruin it by forgetting about the little things like seasoning and in this case condiments.  Maybe the other burgers are better, presumably that's the case unless everyone is there just based on the hype.  In Vegas, it could be either one."

I wish they would make it larger because there are restaurants on each side of it that are dead.  \nI had the Kobe Burger with Peppered Bacon and cheddar cheese.  They have a great beer selection where you can get samplers as well.  They had buffalo flavored fries, but the second time I went, I was sadly informed that they no longer serve them.

But onto the review for here:\n\nWe were seated right away and instantly had our waitress at the table a couple minutes later taking drink orders. She was very good about checking up on us for anything we needed and also had a good sense of humor\n\nI ordered the wings and made an Angus burger for my meal and shared half and half with my friend who made a chicken sandwich.  Their menu is cool because it allows you to create your very own burgers and sandwiches by choosing your meat, bun, cheese and toppings. choices were pretty broad with meat having Angus beef, buffalo, chicken, and higher qualities of beef. Buns were ciabbata, onion, sesame, and then a large selection of cheeses and toppings. If you build a burger though it does not come with fries, so keep that in mind. The burger was good and the beef was very moist and flavorful.  The chicken sandwich was a little bland even after putting on the chipotle sauce that my friend asked for but it wasn't dry which was nice.   The wings were very good but not as spicy as I was hoping for, but my friend did feel that they were very spicy. The wings also came with fries which were seasoned well and cooked well along with some carrots and celery. I did have a bite of the burger my other friend made that came with some au ju sauce which was also very good\n\nPrices were pretty standard for a sit down burger place and the service was great. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star was the bland chicken. I would return to try another creation if I am down in the mandalay our lucite area."

S"Burger Bar: You had me at FOIE GRAS and BLACK TRUFFLES\n\nThis is a great place for quality burgers. You can choose from one of the many different burgers on the menu or build your own. They have a ton of beers on tap,and a bunch of neat cocktails. I tried the Salted Caramel martini. Definitely very strong, but perhaps a little TOO salty for my taste. \n\nWe tried a few burgers when we came in this weekend. \nI ordered a Grilled Chicken burger on an onion bun with a fried egg and truffle mayo.\nThe grilled chicken was really tender and moist. The onion bun was fresh and sooo soft. The fried egg was perfectly runny, and the mayo was so darn tasty! There were flecks of black truffle in the mayo, giving the mayo an awesome kick of truffle flavor. YUM!\n\nThe peppercorn burger was also a hit. The beef was cooked to a perfect medium with a hint of pink. They really piled on the peppercorns on the burger!  The sweet potato fries were fantastic as well. Probably some of the best ones I've had in a while.\n\nOf course, we had to order the ROSSINI BURGER with Foie gras and black truffles.  Yes it is $60, but SO WORTH IT. The richness of the foie gras and the bold flavor of the truffles added so much flavor to the tender Wagyu beef. This has got to be the BEST burger I've ever had. The beef was so tender and the flavors were just heavenly. Since the burger is 60 bucks, they let you choose any side you want with the burger and you also get a free dessert! We tried the mac and cheese croquettes and the chocolate dessert burger.  The croquettes were good, but paled in comparison to the burger. \n\nThe chocolate dessert burger was really good. Awesome dessert that works so well with the burger theme. The warm donut 'bun' was really good. It worked so well with the nutella mousse (the patty) and the passion fruit jelly (cheese). The richness and the tartness balanced each other out very nicely. It was a great way to end our meal!\n\nService was good. Our waiter was very nice, he was a little hard to track down, but  whatever, we were so focused on our food. I don't think we really cared. It's a little far from where I usually play on the strip, but it's a great place to get food on our way into or out of Vegas."

It is made up of vanilla ice-cream, coffee beans, Irish Whiskey, whipped cream, and caramel. I want another one right now as I\'m typing this review from my hotel room. I bet it was better than the one Uma Thurman and John Travolta had in "Pulp Fiction". This one cost more than \'five dollahs\' though (it was $11.00).

The burger was everything it had to be but the fries were like the frozen kind that you can find in a grocery store.\n\nThe servers were prompt, attentive, and friendly and always made sure our water glasses were overflowing.

(Wait, maybe mozzarella because they didnt' have provolone.)  Anyway.  The angus burger was damn juicy and served at a perfect medium-rare.  The portabella mushrooms were AMAZING as well.  It was juicy and so perfectly grilled.  Man, my mouth is watering as I type this.\n\nThe real star of the show was the foie gras.  And yes, it deserves its own paragraph.  A huge chunk of perfectly seared liver.  When bitten into this thing explodes.  I'm serious.  It was like the big bang in your mouth.  You literally smile as you bite into it.  Your senses run wild.  You become reborn.  It is that damn good.  And for only $12 to add it to your burger, do it.  DO IT!\n\nGuys.  Do yourself a favor.  Stop reading the reviews.  Just go.  If you're already there, reading Yelp reviews to figure out what to order.  Just remember.  FOIE GRAS!"

S'It\'s a bit of a pain to find - first off, The Mandalay is set back from the strip, so you have to take a (free) tram to get there.  Once you do, walk through the casino hugging the right til you get to the shops (up the stairs).  Then walk most of the way through the shops towards the Luxor, and it\'ll be a small, unassuming restaurant front on your left.  \n\nIt\'s a chill atmosphere, with whatever music playing the staff feels like listening to (my night it was 90s satellite radio), and personal TVs in the booths.  Nothing pretentious whatsoever.\n\nGrabbed a solo seat at the bar, and was promptly greeted and set up/given water by multiple servers.  Patrick was super duper friendly and made my night very enjoyable.   He and another guy behind the bar seem to call everyone "baby," which I found rather cute and enjoyable (although I\'m taken), but I had the thought that a different woman dining solo as I was might have found it unnerving.  \n\nWhatever, I had a great time chatting and hanging out with Patrick throughout the night, and he was an attentive and informative server.  He seemed to really enjoy his job and is great at it.  Service can often make or break a meal, and it definitely made mine.\n\nI ordered the Hubert Keller burger, with a few changes.  I got the Kobe instead of the Buffalo, and an onion bun instead of the Ciabatta.  I also ordered the zucchini fries, with a couple sides of sauce (truffle aioli and pesto).\n\nThe burger was very good.  Piled high with the toppings, and the shallot and red wine sauce was sooooo goood.  My only complaint was that the bottom bun was soggy as soon as I got my plate.  Not cool.  All in all not the best burger I\'ve ever had, but a great one and it hit the spot.  \n\nThe zucchini fries were AWESOME.  I\'ve rarely had fried veggies that are juicy and taste fresh while maintaining a thick coat of batter.  Also, the serving portion is ample.  The sauces were great.\n\nSadly they don\'t make their own ice cream, which was more noticeable when I decided on a sundae instead of a milkshake.  I got coffee ice cream with nutella, caramel, and graham cracker (I was feeling a big pig-ish).  It came in a banana split style dish - very long and narrow - with two huge scoops of ice cream, shmears of nutella on either side and a couple of graham cracker pieces on either side as well.  The caramel was sadly missing, but it was brought over as soon as he realized.  It was difficult to eat - there was too much ice cream for the dish, the nutella wasn\'t incorporated and is hard to do so yourself when it gets cold, and the graham crackers were whole which meant I had to break them up myself and there was no space to put them really without them fall off the ice cream on to  the table.\n\nSo - bottom line - this place is good if you\'re in the mood for a very good burger, and some inventive fries/sauce choices.  For dessert, maybe stick with the milkshakes over a sundae.'

S'I\'ll keep this one short and simple.\n\nI forgot what burger I ordered, but I think I would only come back for the Hubert Keller burger for $60.  I ordered random toppings, and it was... ok.  For $20, "ok" is "NOT ok."  Sure, the meat was tender, the fixings were fresh, but... I could also get that for $4 at In N Out.\n\nThe $7 vanilla milkshake was... also "ok."  Alright, I\'ll acquiesce that it was good.  But Johnny Rockets\' milkshake still reigns supreme in my book, and a little over half the cost.  (Mind you, I\'d be willing to pay... $10 for an amazing milkshake, and cost has no factor in my decision that Johnny Rockets has the best I\'ve tasted).\n\nThe bartender looked like a buxom "Trinity" (from Matrix), and she was pleasant.  I did sit at the bar with my friends to eat, and it was definitely more enjoyable to have an attractive bartender serve us.\n\nBut come back, I shall probably not.'

S"Pretty decent burgers.  I'm not sure they met the hype, but they weren't horrible either.\n\nTo start, I ordered mine on an onion bun which turned out to be a good choice.  The Kobe beef was nice and juicy, the grilled onions made it sweet and the jalapeno bacon (yes, jalapeno bacon) was a really nice addition as it gave it a nice kick.  And of course, peppered Jack cheese.\n\nThe regular fries, sweet potato fries and the zucchini fries were all great... I just wish they had garlic aioli sauce.  ;)\n\nThe negatives I have are:\n\n1. The price.  Being $16 for the burger alone (as each topping has additional costs) gives it a reason not to go too often (thank goodness it's 250 miles from me), but I'd say it's worth it on the occasional visits to Vegas from here on out.\n\n2. My brother's burger somehow turned out pretty bland.  He had the Kobe with Jack as well but with guacamole and jalapenos on the side, so I question the consistency of the burgers somewhat.\n\n3. To be completely honest, w/ all those toppings, it's hard to tell the difference between Kobe beef and your typical farm or Angus beef.  Might not be a bad idea to save $5 and get that instead."

S"First of all it's the most anyone will probably pay for a burger in there lifetime at least for me i'm sure! But overpaying for food of humble origins is just part of that Vegas thing for good or ill and I have long made peace with it. The place is accurate in it's name as a bar because the size of the place I feel plays a factor in the long lines. Vegas is about huge volumes of people and this place is smaller then allot of restaurants around the strip so planning accordingly goes a long way to starving less. Personally I say what breaks this place apart from great places I have had burgers is not so much that its miles better. But rather the options to assemble your perfect burger is staggering and the possible combinations equally so. Think of it as your one shot to make a burger in your image and then devour it like a hungry god and you get the idea of this place. If your just ordering a regular burger that you think will surpass the regular burgers back home it might be able to but not by huge margins."

I ended up getting the Kobe burger with pepper jack cheese, avocado, grilled onion, jalapeno bacon with Truffle Mayo. OMG- this was the best burger I have ever had. \n\nI also had the skinny fries and ordered the sauce sampler (5 choices) with: Basil Aioli, Truffle mayo, White BBQ Sauce, Spicy Ketchup and Chipotle Aioli. Let me tell you that they were all very good sauces. But that Truffle Mayo is so good I think I could just drink it out of a glass. Not a joke! \n\nI also ordered the Beer Sampler of course. I can't remember all of the names of beer that I got, except I did get Stella Artois, and the Sin City beer.  This was really cool and I loved all of the beer I chose.\n\nEveryone at my table loved this experience. We would have stayed for dessert but our waiter the snob seemed like he wanted us to leave.

The burgers were okay.  They did come at the desired temperature but its not like the pate was anything special.  The Peppercorn burger in fact has too find a grind on the pepper resulting almost a dusty tasting burger.  The bun these come in was quite good, but not good enough to make me succumb to eating it.  The fries were excellent, crunchy outside and light and fluffy inside.  The surprise was the salad, which was excellent.  This looked like hand torn leaves definitely a house made dressing with the perfect touch of creaminess with the gentlest hint of anchovy in the back, just delicious.\n\nVery pricey, but hey if you are going to gamble on a burger, where else would you do it but Vegas!'

S'Not worth it.  Period.  Full stop.  End of discussion.  Saying this is an alternative to Fleur is like saying that a Hyundai with "Ferrari" spray painted on the hood is an alternative to a fine Italian automobile.\n\nI was fully prepared to love this place.  Had the $60 burger.  Was with a companion that ordered the second most expensive burger.  Had a couple sides/appetizers.\n\nAgain, not worth it.  The $60 burger is very good, but it\'s worth more like $25 or $30.  Most everything else?  Typical diner fare.  When I\'m at a place that serves a 60 dollar burger, and numerous 16-23 dollar burgers, I don\'t expect to get appetizers out of a food service of America bag, but that\'s exactly what I got.  Mozzarella sticks at BB should not be the same ones you get at Denny\'s for 5 dollars. Period.  Eff this place.\n\nIf you want to be upscale, be upscale.  If you want to be a Denny\'s alternative, be a Denny\'s alternative.  Mixing and matching the two is just deception.  It\'s BS.  That\'s why this place sucks, and I\'ll never go there again.'

S'Craft beer and burgers, a winning combination.  The Burger Bar in Las Vegas has done a great job of mixing the two.\n\nOur first visit to Burger Bar was exactly one year ago to date - and it was probably one of our best Las Vegas STRIP experiences ever.  Before we knew about Aces and Ales - we always figured craft beer in Vegas was a bust.  As a last ditch attempt on our LV craft beer journey, I decided to do some research on yelp.  Did it exist?  Luckily fellow yelpers were able to direct me to Burger Bar. \n\nAt first we weren\'t sure what to think - my first concern was that being a Hubert Keller restaurant, it would be extremely expensive (sure, his food is amazing and restaurants are to die for, but only on very special occasions!)  My second concern was it\'s location on the strip.  I wasn\'t quite sure what we\'d be in for.\n\nLuckily, my fiance, who refers to my trip preparation as "research," trusts my recommendations, so we took a chance.  We were pleasantly surprised.  It\'s a really cute restaurant, with more of a pub vibe.  Although their logo is  a martini glass with "Burger Bar" on it, they have much more than cosmos and appletinis.  We were very happy to see Dogfish Head 90 Minute on tap (NOT 60, but 90) at a very reasonable price.  They also had a decent bottle selection, keeping in mind that we were in Vegas and weren\'t even expecting to see Sierra Nevada on tap.  They also had their local brew and a few others that were impressive.   Nothing rare, but still more than decent.  We had been back to Vegas since then, but had never made the effort to head towards that side of the strip.\n\nFast forward a year later.  Our 2nd Annual Labor Day trip, we decided to hit Burger Bar since we were already at Mandalay Bay for a concert at the House of Blues.  We first arrived at 8PM and it was packed. No seats at the bar (our preferred seating of choice - easier access to the bartenders :)  and there were a TON of people waiting for a table.  We decided to head to Mix for a beverage and stop by on our way back to see if anyone had left.  Sure enough - 9PM on a Sunday - we found two perfect spots at the bar!  Timing is everything.\n\nDogfish Head 90 Minute was again on tap - 9oz for $5 - pretty good for a 9% beer!  Then I saw Lagunitas Lucky 13 on tap - 9 oz for $4.50.  I really couldn\'t pass that up!\n\nWe ordered rounds of beer, and my fiance and I decided to split the Surf & Turf burger (a burger with lobster and asparagus- $24.00) - surprisingly - soo good, with fries and an order of their Jalapeno Fried Pickles.  The burger was awesome, the fries were crispy and flavorful, (not burnt) and the fried pickles were probably my favorite.  I know people who say anything deep fried is better, and I normally try to avoid that motto like the plague.  But I was glad I tried these. A hint of jalapeno in the light batter, and the clean, fresh flavor of the pickles took away that greasy aftertaste you normally get from fried food.  They did split up our order (they cut our burger up and separated the fries for us).  We noticed after that there is a $2.00 split fee, which didn\'t bother us - but worth mentioning in case you are thinking of sharing.\n\nThe crowd is extremely eclectic.  A variety of college kids, older couples, younger couples, families...and it was busy - even on a Sunday night (although it was Labor Day weekend so that\'s expected).  Almost a little too busy and loud for us.  Although casual, it\'s anything but a dive.\n\nThe service was super friendly and nice (which is one thing that had stuck out for us the first time around).  Higher end burger shops and gastro pubs seem to be the trend wherever we go nowadays - Burger Bar is definitely one of the better ones.  I only give it four stars because it\'s probably not somewhere we would frequent if we lived in LV.  It is a little pricey, and the ambience is a little noisy and cluttered. I will say that Burger Bar is consistent - even a year later we had the same great experience.  Nothing much had changed, but I guess if it ain\'t broke don\'t fix it.  Worth checking out - especially if you enjoy beers and burgers!'

S"The burger was absolutely delicious.  I opted for the angus beef, since many on here said it was delicious on it's own, and both my stomach and my wallet thanked me.  Not once did I question bypassing the Kobe beef or buffalo burgers, tempting as they may be.  Amazingly juicy at a perfectly cooked medium, with mushrooms, peppers and caramelized onions on top, I'm not sure I've had a better burger.  Their housemade dijon was also a delicious addition.  The fries (tried both fat and sweet potato) were good and very reasonably priced but not exactly must-haves.  I also got dessert, sharing both a nutella milkshake and the raspberry float.  The nutella milkshake is a chocolate lover's dream, and luckily I am one.  Chocolate chips, chocolate syrup, chocolate ice cream, chocolate whipped cream and nutella.. yep it's as good as it sounds.  At $9, it's also a bit pricey, but hey, you might as well go all out when you're already spending close to $20 for a burger and fries.  The raspberry float was tasty too, even though I don't usually like fruity things.  All-in-all, an amazing burger place.  Definitely give it a shot if you're in the area."

Luckily for me during my most recent visit there was room for us at the bar so we were seated right away! \n\nThis time around I had the kobe burger with jalapeno flavored bacon and pepper jack cheese on a wheat bun and steak fries, having a slight hang over I really couldn't think of anything better to have than the burger listed above and a nice cold beer. When it comes to beers the Burger Bar has no shortage of them, with a beer list that is as long and as extensive as most top restaurants wine lists. I ended up ordering an organic beer called Stone Mill which was unreal, I am going to yelp about that as well :)\n\nLike most good things this also isn't cheap, however it is worth going to once in a great while to treat yourself and your friends to a killer burger and I cannot think of a better place to do this at."

I had it on Sunday on my way out of town so that means i had completely punished myself by the pool and in the lounges the days earlier. That burger said goodbye in a way i needed. It said "there will be several accidents on the 15 south so this should hold you over for 5+ hours" and it did. Loved it. I had the skinny fries and they didn\'t do a thing for me, however the onion rings were pretty damn good. Next time I will go for onion rings. \n\nStaff is really helpful and very attentive. We waited a little bit for the burgers but it was Sunday and Check out time.

None of the burgers stood out because the only thing we really tasted was the ton of salt that had been put on it and the fries. We all three left feeling Ill from the OD of salt.'

S"I am a fan of Hubert Keller ever since I saw him on Top Chef Masters.  We enjoyed the food at Fleurs de Lys which is closed now and refashioned to Fleurs.  First try at the Burger Bar wasn't too impressive though.  Our burgers came out medium well so it was a bit on the dry side.   Gave Burger Bar another try and this time our burgers came out pink the way we like it.  Still like RM Seafood's RM Burger better (order it medium rare) but Burger Bar is a good alternative since the RM Burger is only served at lunch."

S"I've been waiting a long time to go here and now that I have, I was let down. I ordered the buffalo burger with custom toppings, included truffled mayo. I couldn't have imagined the burger would be so bland. That's because Burger Bar committed the number one food crime: not properly seasoning the food. When I tasted the burger meat alone, it didn't have salt and pepper. It's certainly not what I would have expected when I paid $30 for a burger, and surely not up to the standards of Chef Hubert Keller. This is his place after all. It wasn't a bad burger, but it was a disappointment, and quite frankly, I've had way better burgers on the strip."

S'Not gonna lie, was a little underwhelmed by Burger Bar.  When a restaurant has the name Hubert Keller attached, you expect a certain level of quality, and so I was a little disappointed when what I got was just another burger joint.  That being said, I didn\'t get one of the signature burgers, so maybe I just didn\'t order the right thing.\n\nOrdered the Country National sustainable beef burger and topped it with avocado, grilled onions, and jalapenos.  While the meat was flavorful and cooked properly, the sesame seed bun was slightly hard on the outside and a little dry.  The jalapenos were the pickled, sliced varietal you\'re given to put on your nachos at movie theaters.\n\nWe also had a trio of sides - french fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings - none of which were any better than what you can get at your local neighborhood diner.\n\nIf I were to return, would probably be a little more adventurous and try one of the "Chefs Burgers."'

We had two servers during our meal. The second one totally forgot us and left us hanging once our food arrived.

My bf and I ordered an angus burger (medium rare and medium) with tons of toppings: pickled green tomatoes with a hint of jalapeno minus the spice, spinach, bacon, cheese, chipotle sauce, avocado, etc. (for two burgers). He ordered fried zucchini while I ordered sweet potato fries. He ordered a root beer while I ordered a root beer float. Each burger comes with the standard lettuce, tomatoes and onions on the side. We would've ordered kobe beef if it was from Japan. All the meats are farm grown though so it just tastes THAT much better. Highly recommended before you go on a diet. Meal was about 25 per person.

S'Brought the whole family here to check it out last week and we wanted a completely different experience compared to In and Out.  We wanted to pay the big bucks for a great tasting burger.  Not bad at all...\n\nAmbiance - Well, when you put out a club type front person to take your reservation and then have everyone wait for a table, you kinda create your own "must go" type of atmosphere. Tables, booths and music, this is a long and narrow restaurant, but plenty of room.\n\nService - Not bad, not great. Made a few mistakes on the orders, but overall, decent.\n\nPresentation - Food is kinda slopped onto a large plate, and if you order without fries on each plate , and choose to say, share fries with everyone, then the kitchen hasn\'t a clue how to make the plates look half empty with only the burger on it. I find that to be odd for a 20.00 burger. Yeah, put it on a huge plate and make it look like you paid a lot for a little.\n\nFood - Good taste overall for sure.  Definitely interesting to either order pre-made combinations or order everything on your own.  However, the taste is okay, not mind blowing.\n\nPrice - Very expensive for the quality.  I would have to be careful when I come back, because I will not frequent this place. Getting to it is a challenge since you are going to go to a casino, park, walk and walk and walk...... For the money, without the club type atmosphere you can go to Grind Burger on Trop and it is as good or slightly better.\n\nOverall - Good experience, glad I tried it. Would bring clients, but not sure if I would come back with the family.\n\nFamily note - Don\'t let your kids go to the bathroom alone. Seems that the toilets are in the restaurant, which make it safe, but the fact is the signs bring you to an exit door and you exit the rear of the restaurant and you are in the back of the public mall where anyone and everyone has access.  The door from this public area to the restaurant is open and so, BE CAREFUL.  This is a disaster waiting to happen!  Very poor security.'

S"Can be tricky to find if you don't know Vegas really well, since it's in the walkway *between* Mandalay Bay and the Luxor. It's worth it. Follow your nose to the Lush bath products store across the hall.\n\nOn its face, it seems pretty straightforward: decent bar, burger joint, TVs in the booths showing some sport or other. It goes deeper. Start with the beer list - great selection, large draft list and truly wonderful bottle list. I've had award winning Canadian beers here that I can't even get in Canada. If you've never had a Unibroue beer from Quebec, I recommend the Unibroue 17.\n\nThe menu, too, goes deeper. Not just burgers. Grain fed or naturally raised beef? Wagyu, maybe? You are spoiled for choice, but if that intimidates, they have several reasonable pre-defined burgers to choose from or riff on.\n\nI'm the guy who brought Melissa Y. (below) here on her birthday, making lots of noise about the $60 burger. Kobe beef, foie gras, 1/3oz of shaved black truffle on an onion roll. The Rossini, they call it. We each had one, and they were great. Better than great - putting black truffle on a burger is something I haven't done before or since (except on return trips here) and it is some inspired eats, my friend. You would not do badly to spend some blackjack winnings on that little masterpiece.\n\nBUT. I'm going to tell you something important here, so listen good: you can do better. You can make a thing more pure and more perfect. You can reach the Platonic ideal of burger in this place, and reaching Platonic ideals isn't a thing we get to do very often in our lives. Are you ready? Then let's begin.\n\nDitch the foie - it adds richness where none is required, and the richness it adds is lost in the strong flavours. Ditch the kobe, too. Kobe is either getting you beautiful texture (not irrelevant in ground meat, but certainly *less* so than with steak cuts) or beautiful flavour, but the naturally raised beef has that in spades. Ditch the onion bun as well, if you want my opinion. I like onions plenty, but baked into a roll they lose some of their fire and even if the result is still tasty, you're missing the opportunity to go for their Ciabatta (great texture, nice yeasty flavour, works with the beer) or their Sesame (a classic, done well).\n\nOkay, so now: Keep the black truffles (KEEP THE BLACK TRUFFLES), but maybe get your cheese on, and add some pepper bacon or a fried egg. Congratulations, champ, you've got yourself a burger that adds no pretense, that gilds no lilies, but which explodes with flavour you didn't think a burger could have. This is it, this is the burger you've been waiting for.\n\nI'm proud of you, soldier."

S"I entered Burger Bar a bit disappointed by the decor & location.  After all, this is the guy who also runs Fleur De Lys.  Located in the mall between Luxor & Mandalay Bay and with wood paneling, dark lighting and flat screens on the walls, it looked like just another sports bar.  \n\nBut, once I had the food, I forgot about the setting.  We went for an early dinner around 6 p.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait at all.  I started off with the Lindeman's Framboise, which I think is a beer, but it tastes like Izze and is alcoholic, so even better.  BF had some kind of IPA - big draft selection.  Drink selection a-ok.\n\nThen came the burgers - a buffalo burger for me, and surf & turf for him.  Burgers were excellent, cooked to the right medium rareness.  Fries & onion rings were perfect too.  No oily fries or loose onions after a bite.  Only complaint is that presentation was nonexistent. (I don't like seeing white on my plate unless it's done artistically.)  I also stuffed myself with the Chocolate Burger for dessert.  With donut buns, chocolate ganache meat, jello cheese, strawberry tomatos and mint lettuce, it sounded heavenly.  But, after a couple bites, it was definitely too rich for me.  Probably better to share than tackle alone.\n\nService is eh, but it fits the setting."

S'It\'s not really fair to compare the Burger Bar to other Burger places. Only on the Strip in Vegas can you blow $25 on a burger and not really care. It\'s actually a good value, considering that\'s only 1 hand of black jack for most people. I guarantee you\'ll enjoy this burger way more than that one hand of black jack. \n\nThe Burger bar is celebrity chef, Hubert Keller\'s creation. He has a few of his own burger combinations on the menu, or you can build your own from extensive options. I actually wish that Hubert Keller would have more of his own burgers on there. There are only like 6 listed on the menu. I like creating my own, but hey you are the famous chef, dazzle me. \n\nI\'ve been there a couple of times, so I can report on a few different burgers. I highly recommend the Surf \'n Turf burger. I\'m not sure it says on the menu, but I think all the burgers are 1/2 lb. They are nice and thick. The Surf \'n Turf is Black Angus Beef, topped with a 1/2 grilled lobster tail, and grilled asparagus on a plain bun. Because I believe all burgers should come with cheese, I had them add provolone to it. Now pay attention to this next part, because I believe I have improved on Hubert Keller\'s creation. Order some pesto and mayo on the side. Mix it together and use this as a sauce. Yum, you\'ll never have a burger like that anywhere else. \n\nYou can choose different types of meat for your burger. After trying a Kobe burger on this last visit, from now on that\'s the only way I will go. It\'s about $7 more for a Kobe beef burger than the Black Angus, but it\'s so juicy that it melts in your mouth. The Kobe beef is actually American Kobe, so it\'s not crazy expensive like the real Japanese Kobe. American Kobe is a hybrid between Black Angus and Japanese Wagyu beef. It has the highest marbling of any beef in the United States, and is as fine as you can get without importing actual Japanese Wagyu beef. You also get to pick from 5 different buns and about 45 different toppings. Toppings are as plain as American cheese and are as fancy as pan-seared foie gras. \n\nJust so I could try 2 burgers on this last visit, I cut them in half and shared them with my brother. Burger number 1 was a do it yourself Kobe burger. We agreed on provolone cheese, caramelized onions, sauteed oyster mushrooms, on an onion roll. Had the burger medium rare. The result was such a juicy burger that you didn\'t need any mayo, ketchup, or any other sauce. Just the natural juices of the burger with the toppings was perfection. \n\nBurger number 2 was new on the menu since the last time I ate there. It\'s called the Hubert Keller Burger. The menu says it\'s his favorite. It\'s a buffalo burger with blue cheese, caramelized onions, sauteed baby spinach, aoli, on a ciabatta bun. I think the buffalo had the least amount of fat of all their burgers, as such I found it wasn\'t as juicy. I was expecting it to maybe have some different kind of flavor, but it didn\'t. It could have just been lean ground beef. It\'s also the same price as the Kobe, so unless you are trying to be healthy, go with the Kobe. The blue cheese was kind of medium, which wasn\'t a bad thing. A very strong blue would have over powered everything. Of the 3 I\'ve had so far, it was my least favorite, but still good. \n\nThe fries were ok, but the buttermilk zucchini fries, were excellent. Got those with a ranch dipping sauce. They have some dessert "burgers" on the menu that I must try sometime. They use a donut for a bun and have fillings like cheesecake and grilled pineapple for example. It\'s so hard to save room for them though, perhaps they deserve their own visit.'

Now the burgers here are very expensive but it's Las Vegas; everything is expensive. \n\nThe cool thing about this restaurant is that all the booths have their own TV. They have a good selection of beer and drinks and an even better selection of burger. The one thing I don't like is that all the add-ons (For me: American Cheese, bacon, sprouts) costs extra :( . \n\nI always get my burgers cooked medium-rare and that's the way they turn out. The patty is soft but I feel that it's just a tiny bit too greasy. That's OK, if you're eating a burger you shouldn't be worrying about grease. No burger is complete without french fries BUT DO ASK FOR THEIR AIOLI dipping sauce, it is phenomenal on the burger and even better with the fries.\n\nThe service has always been good here and I like the sports-bar style atmosphere.

There is a lure to being able to customize everything on your burger, especially at a pretty decent price. \n\nI'm not a vegetarian, but always interested in trying different takes on the veggie burger.. so trying to be adventurous i went with it! it was really tasty - a nice blend of veggies and rice, grilled to have a nice bite to it. Sadly, our waitress was not on here game that day and kept forgetting certain add-ons.

I like it that much.\n\nThere are a few tricks to this place though.  You get to pick your burger meat and I honestly think when a reviewer chooses the wrong meat, they feel like this place isn't good.  The trick is that you only need to order the Angus beef burger.  If you get the vegetarian fed beef selection you are simply not going to get that fatty, juicy flavor a burger needs!  Come on people, if you were in the Donner party, would you have selected the skinny person or the fat guy to eat?....lol  The fat is what makes a burger juicy and delicious.  Also, a burger is really only supposed to be cooked medium at the most.  If you really want a juicy burger, anything else will dry it out.\n\nI love the fat fries but my friend swears by the skinny ones.  Maybe I am just prejudice against anything skinny, i dunno :)\n\nI read a review on here about the Nutella milkshake.....OMG!  That was a freaking awesome choice.  I almost couldn't finish that and the meal.  It is almost too much....Notice I said ALMOST?  That's right, I kicked it into FAT GUY gear and took it all down baby!"

S'This was on my Las Vegas "to eat" list since Giada had it on her weekend getaway show. Giada has never steered me wrong before so off to the Burger Bar we went.\n\nWe started the meal off with a nutella chocolate milkshake. I\'m not a big fan of shakes, but the nutella whipped cream was delicious. \n\nThey give you the option of selecting your patty (ground chuck, angus, kobe, turkey or veggie) and then a huge array of toppings to select from.  Each topping comes with a price tag, so the crazier you get the more your burger will cost you.  They had a $60 burger on the menu that was a kobe beef burger with black truffles and truffle oil and 4 or 5 cheeses...insane!\n\nJeff and I both went with the Angus beef burger. I kept my burger simple with pepper jack cheese, guacomole, and jalapeno bacon. yes, jalepeno bacon. It was so spicey and so good! Definitely a great concept. Jeff got Monterey Jack cheese, peppered bacon and Avacado that was simple but delicious.\n\nThey had a ton of fry options but we decided on "fat fries" which were a thicker cut. fry  \n\nEverything was very tasty. It was also priced just right. Both good things in my mind :)'

S"Initially went in because of the novelty: different meats, breads, sides, toppings, etc.  Customize your own, or choose from pre-configured burgers.  You know, like Coldstone, but with meat.  Then found out it's a Hubert Keller establishment, which added to the intrigue. Unfortunately, I'm sure it added to the pricing as well.  \n\nI had a buffalo burger and my, oh my, was it juicy and melt in your mouth!  Buffalo being a lean meat, that's no small feat.  I'd be hard pressed to move away from such a delicious burger on a future visit!  On said visit, I'll definitely want to save room for a sweet burger."

S"I would really give this 2 stars, but I'm upping it a little bit because the other people liked their burgers. So here is the good: we ordered one of their adult millkshakes (has alcohol) - the mint chocolate chip flavored one - which was AWESOME. Mint and chocolate and so drinkable with mounds of chocolate whipped cream and an oreo - what's not to like? It actually didn't taste like alcohol at all, which was good for me, but got us wondering what we were paying for.That came before all our food so I was kinda stuffed by the time I got my burger. My mom had the chicken burger on a wheat bun without additional toppings and my friend had the salmon burger with blue cheese on a sesame bun. Both said that their meats were cooked really well. \n\nI was way waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay less impressed. I had the veggie burger since I'm vegetarian, which had an awesome description but was pretty effing bland. It was made of mushrooms, brown and white rice, lentils, caramelized onions, peas, and potatoes. It tasted just faintly of lentils and the mushy texture added nothing to the experience. I had mine on ciabatta bread, which wasn't toasted enough to my liking so it was kinda too soft. We also ordered sweet potato fries which were good, but nothing special. Same with the zucchini fries, which actually seemed like every generic burger joint zucchini sticks which you can buy in a freezer section. I was SUPER excited about their deep-fried pickles, and sorely disappointed - they were pickle spears, not chips, and the beer batter was crispy but way too heavy. \n\nI don't get why people think this place is so good - must be all the toppings. But if you have to rely on toppings, anything will taste good for a price, won't it?\n\nWhen the milkshake is the best part of my meal, suffice it to say that I won't be coming back. Too bad. When you go to a top chef restaurant, you expect top chef food."

S"3.5 stars. Let's start off with the positives: Service was very, very good. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, quick to refill water, and was basically perfect.\n\nHowever, the 3 stars above indicate something wrong with the experience, and that something was the food itself.\n\nI had the Kobe Beef Burger with Provolone and my fiancee ordered the Hubert Keller burger and fries. Fries were pretty good. Nice texture, nice flavor, but nothing amazing.\n\nThe Hubert Keller burger had a solid combination of flavors, with nice play between the cheese, the meat, and the sauce. If both burgers were as decent as the Hubert Keller burger, I would've probably leaned towards four stars. However, my Kobe beef burger, despite only being cooked to medium and still nice and pink inside, was really dry and flavorless. There was just not enough fat in my burger. No juiciness. And since the burger was very basic other than the cheese, there was nothing else to mask the forgettable patty. Perhaps I should have added some truffle and foie gras to liven it up, but then I'd just be enjoying those things, rather than the burger itself.\n\nIf you're going to come here, spend a bit more and get their specialty burgers, I guess. Wanted to like this place because Hubert Keller is the man, but left feeling a wee bit disappointed."

S'Great? no. Decent - a surprising yes.\n\nWe needed a place to go with our 3.5 year old; and, well, French Fries are her primary sustenance. The Burger Bar more than adequately met our needs.\n\nA big plus is the fact that they have gluten free buns, fries and beers (I wish they had the best GF beer in the world - Harvester). I didn\'t expect such a windfall in a place like Las Vegas (sorry - no offense Vegas). \n\nThe quality of the food stuffs was also remarkably high. From the choice of meats to the "make your own burger" toppings - everything was really well prepared. \n\nMy one fault to the place - it has the feel of a Denny\'s. The overall ambiance is a bit lacking. This is not outside of general expectation - especially as the restaurant is on the LV Strip; but, it would have been nice if the overall decor and ambiance of the Burger Bar were a bit more "upscale."'

S'Hands down, best burger I have ever eaten. Before even entering Mandalay Bay, I was telling myself to critically rate this restaurant for every minute detail. Working from a fast food burger joint (In-N-Out Burger), I\'ve had my plentiful shares of burgers from all sorts of places and arriving at one of my favorite chef\'s resto, Hubert Keller, I was pleasantly impressed\n\nAccompanied by the 2 most trustworthy women in my life, we busted a "Lord of the Ring\'s" journey to get here. From the Manadalay Bay entrance, the Burger Bar is far... Once arrived at this eatery, I noticed the settings is quite dim and social. There was a bar ofcourse but there were also booths and tables. Great take on a mix between a "fine brewery". The place "looked" packed and we had to wait for a good 15 min. for a booth but there were already a couple of empty booths so I didn\'t understand the point of waiting... Our server was nice at first but like a oddly new friend that you meet who suddenly opens up the next day, you see their real side and you don\'t like it. She was serving us like a quick Asian at an oriental restaurant. Didn\'t really care for hospitality, but got our orders right. She was also pregnant so maybe it was a mood swing that we ended up seeing?... I dunno. Anyways, onto what we ordered:\n\nMarinated Chicken Breast Burger w/ Swiss Cheese on a Whole Wheat Bun - Great chicken taste, nice and tender and the slice was not too big to overwhelm the swiss cheese or the bun. The cheese even had holes in it! The bun to compliment was great as well. Fluffy and a discerning wheat taste. These guys weren\'t playing around with the choices of ingredients.\n\nBlack Jack Burger on a Ciabatta - a thick beefy behemoth with thick italian square buns. It wasn\'t accompanied with any cheese (cuz my girl didn\'t ask for any) but the taste was still apparent. Medium well, moist ground up beef which was well seasoned and full of flavor. I really wished there was some sauce to accompany it but for a mere bread, meat, and veg combo, it still tasted out of the ordinary. \n\nSurf and Turf Burger on an Onion Bun - as a lover for steak and lobster, this burger was right up my alley. Think of a cheesecake with a graham cracker crust topped with thick full whip cream... but SAVORIZED! The asparagus was buttered with the texture of a moist graham cracker, my medium rare black angus didn\'t seem as big as the Black Jack Burger\'s but the texture was pure butta (that thing couldn\'t keep together on a fork). The lobster was perfectly cooked, tender for a lean meat, and complimented the steak and asparagus texturely, perfectly! I was kind of worried the server didn\'t ask me if I wanted cheese on it, but honestly you don\'t need any. Just another flavor to get in the way of the stars of the show. On the down side, from how moist everything was, it made the bottom bun really soggy. Nevertheless, the onion bun had an onion taste that you could not miss (which was great!) \n\nThe lettuce, onions, and tomatoes on the side of these burgers were fresh and crisp. It could\'ve been a side salad all together. Plus the pickle garnish had nice suttle taste, not overwhelming like your at home jar pickles, but almost like a cucumber palate cleanser.\n\nTyping about side salads, I had one as one of my sides. It wasn\'t all that great, but with drenched olive oil for a dressing , it did have a good enough taste to finish. The other sides we had were fat fries and sweet potato fries. Fat fries were crispy and thick, which I thought tasted way better than the flimsy sweet potato fries. About sweet potato fries, they are popping up everywhere now, sadly these aren\'t the best I had.\n\nService was slow, food was tasty and fast, and the price was reasonable. Everything came up to be a good 60 bux plus tip, quality = price tonight. FYI: each booth had a mini TV on the side playing some type of sport. That\'s just overkill with the whole bar meets fine dining theme, but hey it sells! It was a great experience for all 3 of us and I would definitely come here again. Portion size is just right for a hungry person, and the taste is incomparable.'

S"BEST BUFFET in LAS VEGAS! \n\nWhen you first arrive, you have to check into a machine and say how many people are in your party. Afterwards it will print out a ticket of what time you should come back to wait in line to pay and get seated. If you don't want to wait, you can just pay $15 to get into the express lane, but since I am a poor college student, my friends and I just waited. Luckily enough for us, we barely waited. The person who take your tickets let us in before our required time. Yay us! Thank you kind sir. \n\n$55 bucks for dinner. Totally worth it,  you just need to eat the right food to get your money's worth. \n\nThe place itself is really nice, I love the atmosphere. Unlike other buffets, this buffet isn't crowded where your squish with other tables. There is enough room to breathe and eat. \n\nThe servers are really nice. Our server was very attentive towards us, even when it got busy. I suggest when you guys are ordering your drinks, you should get their sweet ice tea. It was a clear tea, I thought at first it was water, but it wasn't. The tea was very refreshing and good. I could just sit there and sip the tea all day.  \n\nAs for the food, there is so much to choose from. They have LIKE EVERYTHING, from Asian to Mexican to Italian to American and SEAFOOD! Lets not forget their DESSERT too! They have a whole island dedicated to sweets.  \n\nIf you guys are choosing what buffet to eat at your stay at Vegas, I suggest you guys come to the Bacchanal Buffet. You wont regret it, and neither would your family/friends."

S'At one point while at Bacchanal, sometime after eating a plate overflowing with at least a pound of crab legs and before taking on a final slice of cheesecake (one of the 5 desserts I ravaged), it dawned on me:\n\n"Oh god. I\'m like one of the citizens of the Capital in the Hunger Games. What have I become?!"\n\nI quickly parried that thought however; as much as I want to imagine myself in the vein of a half-starved (and ruggedly handsome) hero of District 12, sometimes...it\'s nice to indulge. \n\nAnd at Bacchanal, indulge you will. \n\nFrom the get-go, you know you are going to try to cram as much food as humanly possible into your stomach to try and "claw back\'" some of the steep entry price (~50$). As a long distance runner with seemingly hollow legs who burns thousands of calories a workout, I think I ended up okay at Bacchanal, maybe eating $30 or so dollars worth of food at its retail price. I can live with that. \n\nBeyond calculations of value (which are almost meaningless in Vegas, which seems to be fueled on the wispy fumes of luxury itself), the fare is par for the course. Everything I ate was of high quality and tasty. \n\nOne thing I didn\'t like so much was the blaring Euro-hip music. I think they blast it so you\'ll eat and leave more quickly, but...it was annoying not to be able to have conversations with the people I went with. \n\nSome things had an extra fine-tuned and endearing touch though, like the fish and chips in little metal frying crates or the Chinese dumplings in individual bamboo baskets (or maybe I\'m easily impressed). \n\nEither way, those small details made the experience more than just a ridiculous gut-stuffing smorgasbord.'

That's pretty much the case at every buffet not named Sizzler.  Very rarely do I leave as impressed as I did after my visit to Bacchanal.\n\nSeriously, hands down the best buffet in Vegas!  The service, the presentation and the food selection are top notch.  They borrow a lot of ideas from other buffets like Wicked Spoon with the cute presentation and tiny portions.  Vegas buffets are all about pleasing the masses.  You might not love the the whole menu, but you'll usually find something you love.  And at Bacchanal, you'll probably find a whole lot more than that.\n\nSome of my favorite things from weekend brunch ($39.99 with Total Rewards card, $41.99 without):\n-fresh juice selection served in glass bottles (melon juice ftw!)\n-unlimited mimosas!\n-perfectly fried chicken fried steak\n-personal omelet bar\n-juicy prime rib\n-super flavorful lamb chops (available during dinner menu transition)\n-seafood selection (crab legs, oysters, mussels, shrimp, sushi)\n-surprisingly decent ramen (pho and wontons also available)\n-dessert crepe bar\n\nCheers to gluttony at its finest!"

S'If you decide to go to a buffet in Vegas -- or anywhere else for that matter -- accept that you will inevitably (a) feel like you\'re getting ripped off if you don\'t constantly have a new full plate of food in front of you every 10 minutes, (b) feel the buttons of your jeans flying off as you\'re stuffing your face to get your monies worth, and (c) feel like a fatass afterwards, and possibly for the rest of the week after your grub-a-thon while wondering to yourself, "Could I have eaten more?" \n\nOnce you get past those three things and accept that buffet experiences are highly subjective upon one\'s own perception of value, you can\'t really go wrong with any high-end buffets. Unless of course, they are terribly bad at EVERYTHING.\n \nI\'ve been here on two occasions. The first time was for dinner, in which I was blown away, not only by the buffet selection and display, but because I nearly did topple over from being so stuffed. The second time was for Sunday brunch and I have to admit, I wasn\'t all that impressed. In fact, I felt a bit ripped off having paid almost as much for brunch as I did for dinner but with a line-up that wasn\'t nearly as impressive. \n\nI had sworn off buffets after the disaster that was Scarpetta\'s brunch buffet (http://www.yelp.com/biz/scarpetta-beverly-hills#hrid:7vyQ6mSiz9IP0uS3Fu9dgg), and ended up losing my born-again buffet V-card to Bacchanal after more than six months. Thinking back, I think that had a lot to do with why I was so impressed on my first visit here, but sorely disappointed the second time around.\n\nMy first visit for dinner, there were oysters aplenty (on the half shell and shooters), crab legs, three different kinds of ceviche in cute little shot glasses, and a large selection of sashimi/sushi options. Since I\'m not a huge meat eater, I couldn\'t comment too much on the meat selection, but between bites of sashimi and the boy feeding me forkfuls of random meat carvings, I think there were meats aplenty, as well. Aside from the seafood and red meats, the other buffet stations didn\'t disappoint either as there were a dish or two at each station that I kept going back for. Last but not least, the dessert display during dinner is totally Instagram-worthy. AYCE mochi ice cream, macarons, two flavors of creme brulee, mini cakes and mousse galore -- it was a diabetic\'s worst nightmare. \n\nIt was simply too bad that brunch was lacking in nearly all aspects of what was offered for dinner in terms of selection and quality -- no oysters, no ceviche, no sashimi, dry meats, no mochi ice cream, no macarons -- but having to pay almost as much only because of free flowing champagne. I know some of you raging alcoholics are trying to resist the urge to want to reach into your monitors and slap me silly for scoffing at the idea of AYCD champagne, but I seriously don\'t see the value in drowning my liver with $10/bottle sparkling wine because we all know "champagne showers" aren\'t really champagne showers unless it\'s with Cristal, Dom, or Moet -- I fancy. \n\nAll kidding aside, Bacchanal is great, but more so for the food porn and the experience of a fancy Vegas buffet than for the food itself. The quality is above average, but that\'s because you\'re paying above average prices and shouldn\'t expect anything less. After about 4 or 5 plates of food, though, it all starts to taste the same anyways and you\'re probably only eating to satisfy your wallet at that point. If you only have time for one buffet and decide on Bacchanal, go for dinner and have your phone ready for Instagram photo ops. \n\nDon\'t forget the stretchy pants.'

After the initial price shock, I was amazed by the endless amounts of food.  It was all very good quality.  Anything you could imagine, they had.  The dessert station was my favorite part.  The waiters brought out unlimited glasses of mimosas and quickly cleared each plate as it was finished off. I don't typically like the idea of buffets, because it promotes eating excessive amounts of food, especially if you are trying to get your money's worth...like $64 worth.. Overall, it was a fun experience, but I would never pay that much for a meal again."

S"I have been here for my Easter Dinner with my hubby drove over 7 + hours but end up very disappointed. We spend $60/person for this buffet, we come here for their seafood station, but we found that the oyster is so skinny & the crab leg is smaller then my pinky finger. Compare with Makino Seafood Buffet in Vegas or Irvine, their oyster & crab leg even better than here!!!  I won't come back again.  It's not worth the price they are charging!!!"

I rivals my other favoeite buffet which is Harrah's of Atlantic City Buffett.  I thoroughly enjoyed the many many flavor available.   They have 4 sections for you endulgence and develop a food coma: asian (peeing duck, sushi, noodles), Italian (pizza, pasta, cheese,  cured meats), American  (Bbq, mac n cheese,  fried edibles ), seafood ( raw bar, snowcrab, shrimp cocktail) AND ALOT MORE.  Not to mention the Dessert island.  All the meats were cooked well and the BBQ BRISKET was OUT OF THIS WORLD! -rich,  tender, savory.. One of best brisket I've ever ate, orgasmic at best! \n\nStaff\nFriendly helpful. . Servers are prompt and courteous.  Ask for Fernando he is a funny host which will entertain you while you're in line.\n                                            \nPrice\n$36 for lunch.. just before dinner to save on the lunch price."

S"This place was amazing! I had been follow the construction and makeover and was so excited it was going to open right before I got to Vegas.\n\nWe waited about an hour and a half to get in for dinner right during prime time. There were lots of empty tables so I'm not quite sure what the hold up was there, but at this point I didn't really care. Once we were about half way through line it moved pretty fast. \n\nThe individual stations are great and the chefs are super friendly! They all welcome you and will answer any questions you have about any of the food. I loved the chef at the pho/ramen station! The pho was pretty good although I would have liked some red chili sauce to put in it. I didn't see any, but I didn't look to hard. I figured it should have been right there. \n\nThe seafood station was good, big hold up with getting your crab legs warmed up. Love that they offer it but need to ask people to move to the side and wait. The rest of  the seafood area was pretty good. The clam bake in a bucket was cute! The shrimp and grits was good as well...but...not like mama makes it. The sauce on top just sorta tasted like chili to me.\n\nThe Italian section was one of my favs! The sliced meats and cheese were fantastic. I read a comment somewhere that its nice they offer more high end meats and cheeses at a buffet but will anyone eat them?? yes this girl right here. It is all right by some of the fresh bread and it's just begging you to make a little sandwich with some olive oil drizzled on it. The honeycomb was right here as well, although I didn't try it, the presentation was amazing. Oh and don't forget to try the Caprese Salad that is in this area too!! I saw the individual portions of baked ziti and lasagna...I wasn't to impressed. It tasted good but was sorta hard and chewy in some places, I could tell it had sat some.\n\nLastly...desserts. Over all they were awesome. Warm chocolate chip cookie in a little bowl was super good. The chef made sure to give me one from her tray she took out of the oven, not the ones that had already been sitting there. The vanilla souffle was PERFECT. I really suggest the Aztec chocolate ice cream. Its got some red pepper in it, and give the perfect little zing to the ice cream. I wasn't to impressed by some of the things just sitting out, like cookies in a jar or bowl, and the Madeline I tried was hard, I didnt even eat it (and i love them).\\\n\nI was a little turned off by some of the items sitting out when all I had heard was everything was made fresh in individual portions. If you are going to do that, you have to throw the bad stuff sometimes. If not for that, 4 1/2 stars. Im taking off another half for the asian section. It was a little... dysfunctional. All the condiments seemed just sort of, thrown out and not by the main dish it needed to be served it. I LOVE me some asian food, and all I sprung for was the Pho. A little more organization is needed I guess.\n\nOver all I would love to go back and try everything I didn't get to. Take your time looking and make a game plan. and pace yourself. There are lots of hidden little things here you can easily pass up, like the fresh breads and the Honey."

S'One of the best buffets I\'ve ever been to!  I hate to admit this (a sin in my family really..) but I am not the biggest fan of buffets.. I admittedly don\'t eat that much, and I always feel like I\'m torturing my tummy to get my money\'s worth ): Also, they\'re a wide selection of food that\'s usually mediocre at best..  Bacchanal (however you pronounce that), however, definitely changed my mind!  Yes, there were MANY MANY choices, but I honestly did not feel pressured to have to eat everything, because the seafood section was amaaazing!  I cannot tell you how many times I went back for more seafood, especially those fresh oysters. And crab legs. So good. Really the highlight of the buffet I thought.  Their carving station was pretty good too, I enjoyed my ribs a lot. But wow. The seafood.\n\nWarning - the wait can be kind of torturous, but they have this electronic system where you sign up on the machine and they text you when you need to come back and get in line, which is kind of nice so you can walk around and do some shopping or gambling while you\'re waiting.  The wait IS about an additional 15 minutes after they text you though.  Also, the "estimated wait time" that they show you after you sign up might not be very accurate.. I\'m assuming it\'s because people drop out. Our estimated wait was 90 minutes, but it only took about 20 for them to text me back. So just be prepared for that!'

S"During my stay in Vegas for the Labor Day weekend, how can I not hit up a few buffets. One of the buffet I went to was Bacchanal Buffet located inside Caesar's Palace. Once my friends and I got pass the 3 step waiting n paying process we were able to indulge in some very yummy foods! The first station I went to was the meat station. WOW they had all kinds of meats prime rib, sausages, brisket, etc. I was only interested in the prime rib. The handful of pieces I had were perfect. I splashed on some horseradish cream and I was in heaven. The next station I went to was the Asian food station -of course! I was surprised they had chow fun and some of my favorite dim sum selections. I was not too impressed with the Italian station and I don't really care for crab legs. The last station I went to was the dessert area. WOW everything was so delish. My two favorite items were the apple pie and the thai ice tea  ice cream. I repeated those items at least 4 times in addition to all the other foods I have already ate. Vegas would not be Vegas without buffets, and I am glad Bacchanal rasied the buffet standard pretty high."

My suggestion is to first do a full walk through to peruse all your options before committing to anything.\n\nHeard that they have a 24 hour pass you can purchase for something like $50 which is totally worth it! I'd probably start with dinner and then let it lap over into the next day trying to fit in as many meals as possible :). \n\nOysters were fresh and delicious! And don't make the same mistake I did and fill up on fresh juice!"

S"This place is a toss up with Wicked Spoon as my current go to buffet. Wicket spoon has much better desserts but this place seems more consistent and more variety. This is located in the Cesears Palace. We went on a weekday lunch for $30 each. I've heard on weekends when it is busy that they charge people $20 for express entrance, really? is this a club?!\n\nAnyways, the food is pretty amazing, they have different ethnicities and the quality is really there. The desserts is decent too, they have mochi and ice cream, just not as much cakes and stuff compared to other buffets. Most people seem to go for the crabs but their sea food department isn't that great."

S"I'm often not a fan of buffets.\n\nThe idea of stuffing my body with as much food in ratio to the price I paid - the idea is appalling and quite disgusting. Chalk up to the mediocre if not downright abysmal quality of buffets in the Toronto area and that's the reason for my pessimistic appraisal of what a buffet is really all about.\n\nHowever, having been to The Bacchanal twice in one week - I can safely say that all my life, I have been going to the wrong buffet!\n\nBacchanal blows every single buffet experience I have had out of the water!  The selection is gargantuan, ranging from fresh shellfish to Asian, to Mexican and the biggest dessert selection I have ever seen!\n\nWhile pricy, it is 100% worth the value and the money you pay.  After all,  the strip is America's playground if not one of the world's - when on vacation, you can't doubt yourself when spending money.  You can save yourself $1 by signing up for Total Rewards however.\n\nThe first night for dinner, we arrived around 7:00pm and was promptly seated by 7:15pm.  Surprising as I've heard that it can be as long as a 2 hour wait!  For the next 3 hours, we stuffed ourselves with nothing but shucked oysters, crab claws and king crab legs.  We hardly tried the other items that were available.  Service was great, as our waters were continually refilled, as was the pop. We didn't have to ask for more!\n\nOur second visit was two days later for lunch at around 12:30pm, again, hardly a wait. If anything, this time the line moved even faster.  No king crab legs, so we got to trying everything else we missed last time!   I was surprise they had Vietnamese pho, and even Japanese ramen!  While not the best pho or ramen I ever had, it was a decent try given the environment.  It won't leave you disgusted, but the soup base for both will leave you satisfied - at least until the real thing!\n\nNotable items other than the aforementioned shellfishes to try are:\n\n- the chocolate mousse\n- crayfish, very spicy and sweet!\n- the cheeseboard items\n- the roasted duck in the Chinese food section\n- the fresh cerviche\n- the prime rib and lamb chops\n\nBacchanal is truly an EPIC feast!"

S'One of the better buffets Vegas has to offer. Coming here on a Saturday, the price per person was $52 + tax. (-1 dollar if you have their players card). \n\nThe wait time wasnt too bad. Since they changed it to the electronic "fast pass" system, our wait was about an hour. You can also input your cell number for text reminders. We decided to walk around the forum shops. \n\nWe got through to pay fairly quick and were seated maybe, 5-10 minutes later. We were seated right next to the Dessert Station, right where the chocolate dipped strawberries were. *drools* \n\nFirst plate, meat station ! Both Doriee and I went for this first. Main reason we came here was because a friend came into town, and wanted lamb chops for dinner. Aside from our usual place to get lamb chops, we decided to try a new place. Since he hasnt been to the Bacchanal Buffet, here we went ! (despite my crying wallet Q_Q) Back to the story. When i arrived at the meat carving station, i asked for a slice of prime rib. then the lamb chops. here\'s how the conversation went between the carver and myself\n\nMe: Can i get some lamb chops?\nChef: How many? \nMe: uhh 4?\nChef: 4? 5? 10?\nMe: *joking* however many you want to give me ! ! !\n\ndot dot dot . . .\n\n*watches the chef use his tongs, and dig deep into the platter of lamb chops and grabbed all it can, and piled it on my plate.* For the record, he put SEVEN lamb chops on my plate. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED ! OM NOM NOM ! He did the same thing with Doriee but she stood firm on her request of 3, and would just pick off mine if she wanted more. \n\nTo give an idea on the SIZE of these lamb chops. In comparison to like the the lamb chops from Koi (Australian? New Zealand?) or from Brio Tuscan Grille, these were at least 2-3x the size... EACH.. oh boy... what did i get myself into. They were heavy enough to make my arm tired from carrying it around to get more food ! x_x I could easily say, they were an easy 1-2lb of MEAT. yeah i ate it all. Meat temp wise, was a hit and miss. throughout everyone at the table, we got about a 50% chance of getting a perfect med rare cook. other 50% was medium or higher. Flavor was good. Overall great lamb chops !\n\nPrime rib was a bit dry. Kind of sad. \n\nCrab was hot (station now at italian area). Butter still by the seafood station though. \nCocktail shrimps were huge. Enough to make me take 2 bites instead of the usual 1 bite chomp-age. \nOyster was fat and fresh. Not completely clean but not bad. I think i had a baby pearl in mine too XD \n\nChicken Ginseng Soup is NOT in individual clay bowls anymore. I guess thats a good thing, so it prevents me from burning my fingers over and over trying to get it... Lol. Flavor was pretty good. I do believe they added salt to the soup though (we never do at home). No sight of ginseng anymore (sad ! i like eating ginseng too) \n\nDESSERTS !\n\nyeah by the time i reached this stage, i was pretty stuffed over limit already. Previously noted chocolate strawberries were all gone for the night. Limited to 1 per person. \n\nSouffles ! my fav ! fresh made to order ! piping hot out of the oven !\n\npistachio - Light ! flavorful ! little sweet ! great with a cup of coffee ! \nchocolate - super rich x_x chocolate-y ! DEFINITELY needed the coffee otherwise i\'d have trouble finishing this. \nchurros - short pieces of churro, freshly made. nice and hot. filled in the middle with a pastry cream. \n\nOverall experience. Great ! Service was a bit slow on picking up used/empty plates. Friend was happy with his experience (he\'s quite picky).\n\nI ate to the point where i didnt have much room in me to breathe ! doriee can attest to seeing my difficulty in breathing.. short quick breathes only x_x'

S'Ah, another good \'ol Friday night in Vegas.  \n\nThe clinging smell of cigarette smoke as you stroll through the crowd of patrons trying their luck...\n\nThe incessant beeps and chimes of slots machines echoing near and far...\n\nAnd of course the lovely parade of scantily-clad ladies on their way to the clubs.\n\nYes it was another glorious night in Sin City.  But amongst all the debaucheries I could\'ve indulged in, I decided to partake in stuffing my face at Caesar\'s revamped ($17,000,000 that is) Bacchanal Buffet.\n\nHANDS DOWN THE BEST BUFFET ON THE STRIP!!  We all know that Vegas is central to providing some of the best of the best restaurants in the world.  There is a tremendous amount of expectation and high standards to land an eatery on the strip, and Bacchanal did not disappoint.\n\nThe food was superb and deserves that distinction in every sense.  Normally you would think of a buffet as serving sub-par, dried-out food that has been sitting under the heat lamp for hours.  Not only that, they\'ve been prodded and molested by the hands of god knows how many people.  But not this one. No no no.  This was the epitome of all buffets.  Everything was served amazingly fresh with the utmost quality.  And from over 500 choices to choose from, that\'s saying a lot.\n\nI swear Caesars hired a chef from every corner of the world because the variety of food to choose from was unreal.  From dim-sum tapas to freshly steamed crab legs, there was something for everybody.  Cheesy I know.  And speaking of cheese, there also was a cheese bar...and yes you can "wine" all you want.\n\nOn top of the usual menu items like prime rib, soups, and salads, they also had various stations where you can request freshly-made entrees.  I confess I have a fetish for pork ramen, and when I came to find out they make it to order with the ingredients I choose, I actually came ;) figuratively that is. Ahem.\n\nThe highlight of everything, in my opinion, has to be the dessert bar.  Let\'s face it, we\'ve all eaten at a buffet to the point of throwing up and yet still find room for dessert.  Now look in the mirror and say it with me, "I\'m a fatty".  There are your usual pastries and puddings, but what was really astounding was their very own gelato and crepes bar.  I particularly fell in love with their cheesecake lollipops, especially the cookies and cream one.  Think of a cheesecake on a stick, encrusted with smooth white chocolate, topped with crispy dippin-dots style Oreo cookie crumbles. Good lord...\n\nThe buffet was also surprisingly clean.  I went on the 5th day since it opened so I guess that isn\'t really saying much, but the service counters (referencing to the aforementioned molestation by many hands) were spotless!  Not one spill mark or greasy tongs; there were waiters on stand-by to clean these up as soon as they occur.  I guess in Caesar\'s Palace, cleanliness IS next to godliness. \n\nService was beyond anything I have ever experienced.  The staff was super friendly and extremely attentive; not one damn detail overlooked.  Drinks were refilled in a flash, requests were greeted with a smile and followed-through with great attention.  We had an amazing waiter, whose name I forgot as I was too busy being a glutton.  He even went to the extent of grabbing bottles of different sauces because we didn\'t know where to find them.  When he said "I\'m gonna be taking good care of you", he wasn\'t messing around.  I can honestly say that this was the best service I have ever gotten at any restaurant.  I tried to catch a glimpse of his name tag to honorably mention him but the man was so dedicated to providing excellent service that he never stood still.  Bless you, good sir.  You were the Alfred to my Batman.\n\nBacchanal is truly like no other buffet experience.  If you\'re on the strip and the borborygmus hits (hopefully only because of hunger), definitely check this place out.  This is THE buffet where you can truly dine like the gods.'

S"Dinner at 5:30 on Saturday night, July 19. Only waited in line 10 minutes. We had a 24 hour buffet pass and knew that we would have to pay a surcharge to use the pass at the Bacchanal Buffet. Was surprised that the surcharge was $32. Without the pass, the dinner cost for the buffet was $52.\n\nWe were seated all the way in the very back of the restaurant which was a perfect spot. We had just a few other four tops around us and our dining room was relatively quiet and away from the clans of families seated at larger tables. Also one end of the buffet was just outside our dining area. It was from this end of the buffet that I began my assessment of just what exactly $52 gets one at this very popular buffet. My strategy before I pickup a plate is to walk the entire buffet line so I can see just what they have to offer and then plan my attack after I have gathered all my intel. \n\nI don't remember the order of the food stations that I passed on my recon of the smorgasbord but remember passing a sushi, Mexican cuisine, and Italian  food and thinking to myself that I have already seen all this type of food at other cheaper buffets. I was already halfway through my recon of the food line and did not see one item that I wanted to go back for and try nor had yet to see any item that justified the cost of the buffet. I finally passed a station and saw that there were steaming king crab legs being served from lobster pots. Made a note of that station and continued scouting the food line. After turning a corner I saw the lines queuing up at two food stations at the other end of the buffet closest to the entrance. One station was a carving station with at least 25 people backed up waiting online for some meat with one carver there handling at least seven or eight kinds of meat.  Why wouldn't Ceasers spread this meat amongst two carving stations and spread out the crowd? There was no one standing online in any of the other food stations I had already passed so they obviously have room to expand to less used areas of the buffet. I was beginning to get irritated that I had to wait online for food that cost so much money and had yet to impress me. Then I looked passed the carving station to the next food station to see an even longer line was queued up.  This I realized this was the money shot of the buffet; king crab legs, stone crab claws and cooked shrimp. So this was what I was paying so much for: the opportunity to stand in line to eat still frozen crab. \n\nWhile the dessert selection was good, it did not compensate for the lack of variety of food on the main buffet nor did it justify the cost. I wish I had read the Yelp reviews before we had eaten here. I feel sorry for some of the Yelp reviewers who stated they waited up to 4 hours in line to eat at this place. I would not come back here nor recommend this buffet. There are much better buffets at the Mandalay Bay, the Encore and Cosmopolitan for less money and less wait time."

S"After eating the Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet two trips in a row I was looking for something else, something MORE, something new... low and behold it was just a couple hotels down the street waiting for my arrival.\n\nUnfortunately it isn't the cheapest of places and I was prepared for that, because sometimes great food doesn't have a price. It was EDC weekend and it was Saturday brunch/lunch time so my wait time was around 45 minutes - one hour (like I said, I will do almost anything for food). Once we paid at the cashier it was another 15-20 minutes and that was a definite struggle as the smells from the continental buffet filled our nostrils and my tummy grumbled in anger. \n\nFINALLY, we were seated and I immediately mapped out my game plan: I hit the mexican station first, then ventured to the asian section, the fried foods/american section, the seafood section, and lastly the desserts. Although in theory this worked well, it was a mission trying to decide what I wanted at these various sections because everything looked appetizing. I didn't get a chance to try a bite of everything because there isn't enough space in my stomach for 8 countries of food. \n\nHere are some unique dishes that aren't at your atypical buffet: meatballs with bowtie pasta, fresh made to order crepes, baked chocolate chip cookies, brown butter caramel ice cream, al pastor tacos, oysters, mussels, xiao long bao (YES, I am from Arcadia this was a big deal). \n\nThis is a vegas MUST TRY I don't care what your favorite buffet is currently, JUST FORGET ABOUT IT, because you go BACCH, you always go back."

S"My second trip to the Bacchanal buffet was not the same as my first experience. This second time around was disappointing. Lamb chops where tough and not eatable. BBQ beef ribs where partially raw. Shrimp cocktail was off. I found it strange that there was no line on a Sunday night around diner time. I'm so bummed b/c we had such an amazing first experience. Probably won't be back considering how expensive this buffet is. :("

S'Buffets are never a good option for me since I never eat enough and also don\'t really appreciate the "expensive\' items as much as others.\n\nThat said, I really enjoyed Bacchanal for a number of other reasons. They have a huge selection that varies from traditional Chinese Black Chicken Soup (with Ginseng) to little baskets of Fried Chicken and Fries.\n\nI personally really enjoyed the Bolognese (but I tend to love anything with Marinara/Meat Sauce). The dessert selection was pretty extensive but I found it odd that there was a 2-Mochi limit, when there was a free-for-all for the crab legs.\n\nThe overall quality of the food seemed pretty good to me and I really enjoyed the Spicy Poke (it is surprisingly spicy).\n\nOne thing I really wished they had more of was fruit, I know the typical buffet goer might not feel the same, but the limited selection of fruit was kind of sad.\n\nThe decor is super cute and my girls and I were lucky enough to get a semi-private room. The service was great and the waiters were kind enough to assist me with my bachelorette party scavenger hunt by suggesting a male escort.\n\nMake sure you get there early enough to avoid the lines! If you have a party of 10 or more they will charge you gratuity right off the bat. Overall, the buffet was pretty good but not necessarily worth the price for someone like me.'

S"made my way back to Bacchanal but for brunch this time and i was just as impressed with this experience as i was with my dinner one! brunch starts at 7am on saturday and sunday but there was no way that our group was going to make it at that time haha. our group of 8 showed up closer to 11am on a saturday morning and there was NO LINE! \n\nprice is $41 for brunch and that includes unlimited mimosas :) note that if you are with a party of 8, then they will charge 18% gratuity so make sure to mention your group size when you are purchasing your meal. we didnt know this so after we had paid separately without gratuity included, we all had to go back to the cashier and get gratuity added to our total - was a bit confusing but no biggie.\n\nwe got seated right away and off to the food! there were a lot of breakfast-y items at 11am but as time progressed, we did notice food items being changed out so it was kind of cool that every time you looked at the food, you could find something different to try. seafood options included crab legs, shrimp cocktail and mussels. the carving station had a ton of options too like prime rib, beef brisket (my fave), ham, sausage, and more that i can't even remember. and omg i loved all the asian food that i tried! the har gow, congee, fried rice, chow mein, ramen - it was all legit! also loved the tacos that are made fresh for you. i stumbled upon this toward the end of the meal i had to make room for these and im glad i did cuz they were delicious! oh and desserts too - fresh churros, souflees, lava cake, ice cream, and gelato. perfect way to end the meal. we were told there was a 2 hour time limit for the table and we definitely used the entire time to eat and drink the morning away :)"

S"$178 for two ppl.  At this price- so not worth it.  Per person breakdown: $60 holiday price + $20 express lane + TIP because the cashier stares as you're signing and eyeing to see if you are tipping and the she STAMPS your receipt with big block letters that say TIP on top.  It's weird, I'm gonna say it. \n\nThe buffet itself is ok.  It's hella messy.  Food ain't made with love.  If I wanted bad dim sum I can get it a buck each at Dim Sum express.  \n\nOh but the dessert.  We are talking premium price, I expect french macarons made with almond flour with perfect macaron feet.  But there are no macarons.  There are gelato, different colors but same flavor.  The best thing are the jumbo chocolate covered strawberries.  \n\nSome of the memorable items: super dry hamburgers the cooks keep shoving forward but no ones touching, the made from concentrate juice bar, the crazy hectic layout, frazzled stressed out waitresses blaming each other for petty shit.\n\nWicked Spoon is a step above this.  Wynn buffet is a step above Wicked Spoon."

My favorite was the mini Cheese Burgers, the Steamed Muscles, the Cream Cheese Wantons, the Sashimi.  Really it was all so good.  I even tried a oyster shooter for the first time.  It was okay.  I guess I'm not a fan.  The desert was great and I had a bunch of it.  There was even Red bean Mochi!\n\nWords can't describe the food, you need to see the photos.  Come on an empty stomach."

Their selection of food ranged from American, Mexican, Italian, & Asian. I felt like the ethnic food they offered was pretty much authentic tasting. It didn't taste 'Americanized' if that makes sense. I don't know what else to say about the food except that I pretty much tried every dish that they offered & I loved each & every one of them!\n\nThe desserts were really good too!

I was able to grab some oysters and an oyster shooter which I enjoyed.\n\nThe selection and quality of Asian food was above some of the other high end buffets on the strip.\n\nOne of my favorite items were the sweet potato tater tots.  Went back for seconds.\n\nThe desserts were good, but I was hoping for more or a larger variety and quality.  I am a dessert person, so I wasn't wow'ed.\n\nI was here over the Thanksgiving holiday so the line was super long and I was a bit disappointed to find out there was no unlimited mimosas or bloody Mary's offered with the buffet price, which was higher than normal as well."

I ate until my stomach (the organ) had shooting pain from all the food I managed to stuff down. Damn you, amateur stomach, I wish you could handle more of that good stuff!\n\nTips: \n\n- Oysters and oyster shooters are served beginning 3:00pm! \n- If you're staying at Caesar's Palace, it might be worth it to get a 24 hour pass to stop by for food any time within a 24 hour period.\n- Most of the food stations have items there that are order-only and off menu. \n- Their ramen is freakin delicous. Okay, that's not a tip but I needed to include it somewhere.\n- Your Player's club card gives you a $1 discount\n- Our price was $41.99 but this number may be a moving target.

Just grab a drink to sip in line and you'll be good. \n\nThere is a huge selection of food and just about everything is incredible. Here are a few if my standouts:\n. Crab legs - a must have\n. Ceviche - delicious \n. Tuna and salmon sashimi (like a high end sushi place!)\n. Charcuterie bar - lots of cheese and meat selections \n.

Some friends from out of town decided this would be a good place for a late lunch and it was.\n\nThere is a wonderful selection.  My favorites were the oysters on the half shell, the lamb chops, and the oyster shooter.  I could have been blissfully filled with those three items but I tried several other things.  The lobster bisque was very good.  There were also some nice salads.\n\nI did notice that there were a couple of things missing from the opening.  There was no tomahawk steak and there were no macarons at the dessert station (that's almost an unforgivable fail!)\n\nThe Bacchanal still is one of the better buffets on the Strip.

S"Came in at the perfect time.  You know - at the end of breakfast, but at the beginning of brunch.  There wasn't a wait to get in at that time and I was able to have a little bit of breakfast and lunch.  Worked out well.   I have to say that this is the best buffet in Vegas.   \n\nThough the buffet is smaller than some of the other top buffets, they make up for it in quality.  Like Wicked Spoon, they offer a la carte portions.  I love that - it's clean, individually portioned, and you get buffet items you'd expect on full restaurant menus.\n\nThey won me over when I saw red velvet pancakes and monte cristo sandwiches for breakfast.  And they surprised me when I saw taiwanese breakfast offerings and pretty solid XLB and hargow dumplings.  My favorite breakfast item was their Croque Madame which had a perfectly over-medium egg in the middle of the sandwich.  My buddy, a tough critic, thought that the eggs benedict was perfect.\n\nFor lunch, loved their shrimp cocktail, their ceviche bar and gaspacho.  They also had a taco bar where they freshly cooked carne asada and al pastor.  And they had a full guac/salsa bar.  It was definitely good.  But the star of the show was their meat station.  They offered prime rib, st louis ribs, and beef brisket.  The ribs were tough and dry - didn't recommend it.  But I requested my brisket extra fatty and the guy behind the counter lit up like my Christmas tree.  He gave me some great burnt ends and it was just some great meat.  I really enjoyed my brisket here.\n\nWhile I love entrees, my heart is always reserved for dessert. They definitely had a few solid offerings.  They have some fancy looking chocolate, they have creme brulee, I really liked their praline tarts, they had a crepe station, and a gelato bar.  My favorite gelato was their baklava gelato.  Pretty solid.  It didn't beat the Thai Tea gelato I had at Wicked Spoon the night before.  And I can't say that the dessert was better than the Bellagio buffet.  But overall..I thought that the quality entrees made this buffet stand out above its competitors."

Certain things were spot on but many of the main dishes were weak. The brisket was great, ribs were cold and a bit gummy & the sausage was too greasy with not enough flavor & also cold. They had some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever had & when you added the gravy took it somewhere crazy for me lol! the Mac & cheese was bland. I wasn't a fan of the pasta, but they made great ramen & the pork broth was identical to the soup houses in japan. The tacos were money!! Boiled crab legs were on point & they cut them down the middle which made it a neat treat. I can go on & on but overall it's not worth the wait unless you're really patient and can't decide what you want for dinner lol. It's a step above golden coral if you ask me"

My eyes lit up like I was in buffet heaven.  \nOnce I started to visit each station and loaded up on some food I was impressed on the selections of each station.  Peking duck and Chinese roast pork at the Chinese station, 6+ different type rolls at the sushi station, chilled snow crab legs on the seafood station and hot just boiled snow crab legs on another station!, a station just for cold cuts and sliced meats, a carver station, Mexican station, and a huge island station for sweets/desserts!

They have seafood, sushi, comfort food, tacos bar, salad bar, pasta, dim sum, noodle bar, Chinese food, pizza, etc etc etc. \n\nAlso, whatever dessert you are cravings..they have it.

I am not exaggerating by much that the serving area is almost as big as the table area.  American, Mexican, Asian, Italian sections.  $45.00 for a buffet is a ton of money.  But let me make a case for the price to value.  If you want you eat all the crabs, shrimp, oysters, kyobi beef burger's you want.  If you don't want to eat seafood you can have lamb chops or prime rib carved to you specification.  Now I had two lamb chops and a slice of prime rib(not a huge slice just polite).  If I go to any high end steak house I have just spent $45 or more for either the lamb chops or the prime rib.  And these meats are high end quality.  Had a few shrimp, a couple of crab legs just to make sure I got my monies worth.  I did not have dessert but Mrs K said they where very good.

Went on a Saturday and they said they would call us back in 2 hours. They get your number to text you when they are ready which is nice so you can go explore. We went to the forum shops to kill time and they ended up texting us to come back in a little over an hour so it wasn't bad. \n\nThe stations: seafood, meat, Mexican, Italian, bread, Asian, salads, desserts.\n\nI couldn't find anything I wanted to get seconds of! So sad. Well I would actually have gotten seconds of the crepe if I wasn't so full. But that's it, nothing else stood out, and the crepe only stood out because you can't mess up Nutella. Bahh, I spent $60 on whatever food, should have stopped walking when I hit Nobu.\n\nCrab legs were good, I liked cold better than the hot ones which they serve at the Italian station. There is NO line for the hot ones. I repeat NO LINE for HOT CRAB legs, so go there first if you only want them hot. The only line I had to wait in was for the seafood station and it takes a while because everyone is filling their plates with crab legs and oysters to get their $'s worth. \n\nOverall not as many choices as I thought. Not even good quality. Meat was dry, seafood was low quality, Italian station pizza was horrible, sushi did not look exciting, dumplings weren't bad, bread was hard, didn't even try the Mexican station because it was so regular. All in all, nothing exciting. I looked back at the pictures and they looked more fun and exciting before, maybe it went downhill?\n\nDessert station looked so pretty. Too bad I tried ALL of them and only liked the Oreo mousse and the crepe. Waited 8 minutes for the Chocolate Souffl\xc3\xa9, which you ask them to make, and it tasted like powdered fake chocolate, like the ones used for hot chocolate, so gross!!! Cake pop look a likes were gross, the peanut butter cone things were so cute, but the cone was stale. Gelato wasn't so bad so definitely try that. So sad, I have such a big sweet tooth I thought I'd be in heaven. I was so disappointed with every bite.\n\nMy whole group was actually disappointed and they love buffets.  \n\nIf you like good quality food, don't do this. If you like tons of options and endless eating with mediocre food you'll probably be happy. I'm more of a person that would rather have an entree and dessert that blows my mind, than 10 entrees and desserts that are very forgetful. This is more of a bunch of unlimited 2-3 star food."

They also had a ramen/pho station. I tried the pho and the broth was delicious! The dessert station is definitely the star of the show. Their made to order crepe station offers different fruit, toasted almonds, whipped cream, Nutella and more. The French macaroons were so good. They offer different flavors of gelato that I normally don't see in other buffets.\n\nService was much faster this time around. I can't wait to come back and try their breakfast offering!"

S"I think this is easily the best buffet in vegas. I have lived here for almost twenty years and I have been to almost every buffet, but this buffet offers the largest selection of high quality food. I highly recommend this if you are visiting Las Vegas. \nI went with a friend to this buffet and he had an express pass, which saved SOOO much time. The lines for dinner are extremely long if you don't have a pass. But really, this place is just gorgeous; the atmosphere and the food are unbeatable! The service was pretty good too.\nI definitely recommend this buffet although it is quite the investment in one meal..."

S"It's a fun place, good atmosphere but that's all.  There's a wide selection of food but most of it wasn't really good.  I could go again but next time to eat the seafood only.  I wasn't too impressed for the $50 price I had to pay for the dinner buffet. This makes for a good lunch spot tho.  It seemed like the beef and lamb chops were sitting out all day, which they most likely were as in most buffets.  The sushi was dry and had absolutely no flavor at all.  I give it an average rating."

S'5 stars for a buffet, It better be out of this world!  It has to revolutionize buffets as we know it.  Short of serving Unicorn and Dragon meat, Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace delivers.  WOW and do they deliver.  I am going to give you an idea of what they were serving this Saturday night I went and do a little review on the food.\n\nAs you enter, you see the "modern", fresh clean look of the restaurant.  They have different stations and they actually cook your food, made to order at each station!  The line starts with the seafood.   They have someone that offers to steam your snow crab legs or you can get it off the rack cold.  They have 4 people in the back schucking Oysters and the had a Monster pile of large shrimp.  Curve around the corner you they have small plates of food ready to go (a la Wicked spoon).  Clam bake, Seafood Piaia, boiled shrimp w/head on, Lobster chowder..etc.\n\nThe next station is the bar b que station.  They were cutting brisket and cowboy bone in steaks.  Chicken and fries, Mac and cheese..etc.\n\nWe then have an Artisan bread station (which I did not try) and goes to the Mexican Food station.  Fresh made tortillas to order, with Al Pastor cut from the rack!  Amazing Salsa bar.\n\nThen it curves around to the italian station with Pizza, pasta, Lasagna, meatballs etc...  Continues to a Cheese and meat station (yes they have a designated section entirely of meat and cheeses.)\n\nContinuing down the line to the Salad Station and then the made to order Noodle bar!  They Noodle bar makes Ramen, Wonton noodles, and Pho.  \n\nNow to the Asian Section.  they had Amazing Duck (large Large pieces), Char Sui, Moves to Sushi then to Japanese Curry station with Chinese Porridge.\n\nIf that was not enough, it moves to the Dim sum section (Har Gow, Shui Mai, Sho Long Bai, Lotus wrapped rice, Char Shui Bao etc..)  Then finally to the Asian noodle section (Pad Thai, Fried noodles..etc.)\n\nI did not event mention the dessert section which features a Crepe (made to order) section, Candy bar (yes like at weddings), Banana\'s Foster, Gelato and Amazing Maccaroons (that rival Payard\'s across the way).\n\nPhew, that was just from the amazing memory of seeing everything, but to give you a review of the food:\n\nNoodle Bar:  Worth the trip alone!  I went back twice for the Ramen Noodles.  They serve it in their special Tonkotsu broth.  AMAZING. You would think you were at a Ramen house.  Not too salty, but savory with a hint of pork fat.  I added a piece of duck in it to give it a bit more emphasis.  I went back twice to get it !\n\nMexican Taco\'s:  Had the Al Pastor.  It was very flavorful and the tortilla really makes this taco great.  Like any great taco place, they made the tortilla fresh and put the Al Pastor on it.  I would suggest getting the taco and moving to the salsa bar and put your own toppings.  \n\nSeafood Bar:  I had the cooked snow crab legs and they were sweet and on point.  I liked it better than the cold version.  The fresh Oysters were great also!  I am weary about raw items at a Buffet, but the quality was great and it had a great sweet, smooth taste with only hint of the ocean on the backside.  Perfect!  The Lobster chowder was smokey (from the bacon) and smooth.  Very good.\n\nMeat Cutting station:  The lamb chops were the best ever.  I used to think the Wynn buffet Lamb Chops were great, but these were twice as big, medium rare and just a little gamey.  They are a must.  I did not try anything else, but the Brisket and the Cowboy steak looked perfectly cooked.\n\nThe Dim sum was good not great.  Har gow skin was thick and the Shui Mai was ok.  Sho long bai was a bit dry, but we are not going to get HK dim sum at any buffett.\n\nI made a plate of Duck and Char Shui rice (like at Sam woo)  The Duck was as good as any Chinese Restaurant with large chunks, a lot of meat.  Sweet and great skin, I found this to be one of the best part of the meal, since i also put it in the noodles.\n\nI had the Nutella/Banana Crepe and it was wonderful, but the Macaroons were the star of the buffet.  I had to ask if they were from Payards, and they told me were not, but the place that brings it in always gets mistaken for the Payards Macaroons.  They sweet, crispy with just a hint of the "jam" layer.  Not over powering, just right.\n\nI used to think the Sterling Brunch was the best Buffet.  Although it still is one of the best I found the fresh food stations, made to order, put Bacchanal over the top.  Next to the lobster tails w/Caviar at Sterling Brunch, Bacchanal is the new sherriff in town and I highly recommend to everyone!'

S"Easily the best buffet in Vegas.\n\nI've gone to probably 80% of all the buffets in Vegas besides the one in Paris and out of all the ones I've been, this place takes the cake without hesitation. Make sure you come on a weekday, before 6:30PM if you don't want to wait in line and pay over $60-70 a person. Their prices change depending on the weekends, and holidays (DO NOT GO ON A HOLIDAY WEEKEND! THE PRICE GOES TO AROUND 90 A PERSON). Also weekend prices are more expensive as well. If you go Mon-Thurs (not sure about sunday) the price is around 55 a person. DO IT!"

S"So, sad to say, I only got to try breakfast, but, that was amazing enough for me! Breakfast was about 25$ per person.\n\nI had tried this buffet once before they remodeled it, and let me tell you, that thing was tiny, would hardly call it a buffet. But now, the new and improved buffet is much much better. \n\nOur waitress was super nice, and she kept thanking us by the name on the credit card that was paid. For example, thank you ms Tam and guests. Or how are Ms Tam and her friends doing. Our table got a kick out of this.\n\nThere were two types of fresh OJ in cute little bottles. Regular and tropical, sadly I didn't try to tropical, they had ran out but my friend said it was amazing, she had grabbed the last one. \n\nWe had only got through half the buffet before our plates were filled, and there were so much more left to eat! There were different kinds of eggs, hash browns, sausages, bacon, typical breakfast foods.  There was an Asian area where they made noodles to order. Everything came in cute mini baskets, skillets, or dishes. The presentation was amazing. \n\nThere was a crepe station, where they make the crepe for you, but than you put on the toppings yourself. Fresh fruits, dried fruits, sugar, fudge, Nutella, caramel, whip cream and so much more. I also saw them started to chocolate dip strawberries for lunch.\n\nI had wish we hadn't waited till the last day to eat here. I would love to try their dinner. But if breakfast was this great, I can only imagine dinner."

S"I liked their crab legs. I was second in a huge forming line. They are cracked, so no work has to be done. Sushi was very fresh. They have really cute bite sized desserts, so you can sample a lot of things. The dessert section is hidden away from everything else, so I think there is a good chance a lot of people forget about it. They have gellato in many different flavors like sour cherry. Very cute desserts. I don't know what kind of dessert I was eating. White chocolate with edible silver balls and soft center. Good what ever it was. I am very picky, and I found a lot of stuff I could eat. However for the price, I think I like the Bellagio better. Their is also a buffet on the stip with circular aquariums at the buffet with tropical desserts that are out of this world. Just can't remember the name of it :( I just remember you take an esculator down to get to the buffet. If you love Sushi Todai is a great fish and sushi buffet for reasonable prices. They have chicken and beef too!"

S"It's hard to rate a buffet because it's really all about the items YOU choose. And here, there are soooo many to choose from, I am sure 100 people will have 100 completely different experiences based on what they choose to eat.\n\nThis buffet is massive and good quality for a buffet, so if you can't find something you like, you are probably just in a bad mood or a true buffet hater, and then you shoulda stayed home.\n\nService for us was spotty, thus not 5 stars. We stopped seeing our waitress after the first two orange juices and though we didn't stay long, plates did stay in the middle of our table with no pick-up.\n\nWe went for lunch. I'll give you an idea of what you can expect here at the various stations:\n--Fresh cold and cooked seafood items, including crab and shrimp. I tried the corn lobster soup and it was super salty and some baked cod that I didn't like, so my impression here was not great. But lots of folks just piled plates high with in-shell crab and had at it, so I'm guessing that was a hit.\n--Italian station. Pastas and pizzas. I didn't try anything here but my daughter thought the pizza was delicious.\n--Salad station. I am a salad lover, so I was sad to see that nothing in this section looked appealing to me.\n--Indian food\n--Sushi. YES! The salmon and hamachi nigiri were small but quite good. There were also some sushi rolls that were OK.\n--Chinese. Didn't try any, but decent selection and some dim sum items.\n--American station with the carved meats, sliders, baked potatoes, etc. This was one of the more crowded stations, but I'll admit I tried none of it.\n--Mexican station: Living in the Portland area where Mexican food generally sucks, I loved this section! Someone was there to grill up mini tacos for you and there were mini tostadas and green chili verde, and more. Between this and the sushi station, I was happy.\n--Desserts: You know when you go into a Whole Foods and the bakery has all those mini desserts that look so good but cost like $4-5 each? So you pick your favorite and go home? Well imagine that you've paid this $36 entrance fee, and now you can literally try as many as you want! I took a bite of about 7 of them. Nothing really stood out to me, but I have the same experience at Whole Foods. More eye candy than anything. For dessert fiends though, you could have your whole meal at this station. There is a LOT to choose from, including all the mini desserts and some gelato and a crepe station."

S"What an Epic Feast as they claim!!!\nEvery dish is crafted to near perfection with care. I felt like most items were cooked to order. All of the food were in perfect temperature, veggies had good flavor with good texture.(not mushy at all.) I dislike mushy veggies, they taste like baby food.\n\nI have been to many buffets in Vegas, and I think this one is the best. There are many stations to please everyone's tastebuds. The staff are extremely polite and professional. The dessert station is out of this world. Its like having a full operational French bakery in the buffet. They have everything from cookies, macaroons, gelatos, crepes, and even mochi icecream!!!!\n\nThank you Caesars Entertainment corporation for complimentary 24 hour buffet pass for veterans for Veterans Day!

S"Ahhhhh, a good Vegas buffet.. Who doesn't look forward to absolute permission to eat their face off and the food coma that ensues? But since the prices of these buffets have increased so significantly in the last few years I've found it a little harder to justify multiple visits in one trip. For the same price of a buffet, I can go eat at a fun restaurant and maybe save a few calories by not having the option of eating pizza and chicken wings and French fries all in one go. My last trip to Sin City included a trip to Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace and this may have completely changed my mind about what a buffet should be and how often I'm willing to go.\n\nIn a word...incredible. Anything you can imagine was available at their weekend brunch. From an amazing assortment of Chinese, Korean, Japanese, even Vietnamese to Italian pizza and pastas. Sliders and hot dogs to chicken and waffles to pancakes to quiche, I mean the list goes on and on. There were so many different stations (I counted a carving station, an omelet station, a pho/noodle station, a pasta station) and I think there could've been more, but after a while I knew I wouldn't be able to walk back to the room if I kept eating. There was also a fantastic array of raw sea food and sushi available. And everything was good, some items were even great (any of their pizzas and the Korean bbq short ribs, for sure!). I loved that many of the dishes were served in individual hot dishes instead of the big bulk catering dishes that everyone picks out of. The downside to that was that it made carrying things a little difficult as you could really only carry two personal dishes at a time. I'm going to try to think of a system next time I go where I can try to grab as many as five different dishes in one trip. \n\nI never made it to the dessert section, although my friend did declare that they had some of the best bread pudding she had ever tasted. For $45 (that's the weekend brunch price - before 3:00 PM) Bacchanal is 100% worth the money, time and calories. Drinks are included (even mimosas!), and you will definitely eat enough so that you won't me hungry for a very long time. Considering that the night before I bought a bottle of water and a very small turkey sandwich in the hotel lobby for $18, this is an absolute steal. Can't wait to go back and try this one more time!"

S'I don\'t normally pay $60 to eat at a buffet, but when I do, it\'s because I\'m in Vegas.  \n\nAfter all, where else would you have to spend that that much on a buffet?  And while I\'d typically prefer to spend that kind of money on a more "traditional" meal, things are a little different when you\'re in the City of Sin/Gluttony.  So, if I\'m going to do some damage at a buffet, I might as well do it right!\n\nLike so many of the better (and pricier) buffets in Vegas, Bacchanal does a great job of combining both quality (for a buffet) and variety in their offerings.  Seriously, there\'s PLENTY to choose from - seafood (crab legs, raw oysters, mussels, shrimp, etc.), sushi, salad, pizza, pastas, made-to-order tacos, carvery station (lamb, prime rib, sausages, pork loin, etc.), Asian dishes, fruits, desserts (chocolate covered strawberries!), and more.  \n\n-- PLATE #1 - Prime Rib, Sausage, lamb, Onion Rings\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#mrb056oZjB9C2jzPM-2sYQ)\nThe guy gave me a cut matching the wellness I wanted, but also with lot of tendons.  Still, the meat was tender and well-seasoned.  The lamb was great as well (perhaps a tad salty) and the sausage was fine, though nothing special.\n\n-- PLATE #2 - Raw Oysters, Fresh Snow Crab Legs, Salmon Sashimi, Tempura Roll\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#IK9Vz3U6qMf6W1-Yi22rNA)\nFor the most part, Bacchanal\'s seafood is fresh.  The oysters were plump and meaty (though not as sweet as smaller varieties) and the crab was terrific (too bad no king crab...).  Also, while the tempura roll was rather "meh", the salmon sashimi was pretty good.\n\n-- PLATE #3 - Carne Asada Taco, Carnitas Taco, and Chips with Salsa and Guacamole\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#ITbZBYTJhTZ8GClrU4nLHg)\nI had hopes for the tacos since they were cooked to order, but they were just okay.  The taste was fine, but both the carne asada and carnitas were dry and tough.  Not surprising given how small the meat was cut though.\n\n-- PLATE #4 - Lobster Chowder and Kobe Beef Slider\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bacchanal-buffet-las-vegas-7?select=p2b3VrXJwMZiRd0JwLCdJA#J0kJKgJhIn2HdzgdVPaWOQ)\nThe chowder was a little salty, but the consistency was spot on.  Impressive for a buffet, though I wish there was more lobster.  The sliders though were easily the worst thing I had.  Sitting under the warmers grossly overcooked the beef.\n\nTo deal with the steady crowd that flows in every night, Bacchanal has a pretty good system set-up.  Instead of the usual snaking lines, they have kiosks where you can enter your name, party size, and cell phone number.  After the machine prints out your ticket, you\'re free to leave until they text you to let you know you\'re next.  Otherwise, you can pay an extra $15 per person for the "express" option.\n\nWhile the "express" option is nice, it\'s also a gamble.  The kiosk quoted a 45-55 minute wait for the two of us, which seemed high since it was quiet on a Thursday night at 8pm.  Still, we declined since we weren\'t that hungry anyways.  No more than about 5-10 minutes later though, we got a text telling us we were up.  Risky, to say the least.\n\nAlthough I can\'t say for myself, I\'ve heard from friends that Wicked Spoon has fallen off a bit as of late.  Between that and how the vast majority of what we had was pretty solid (save for the sliders, but much better overall than Bellagio), Bacchanal just might be my new favorite buffet in Vegas.  Even if it might be by default.'

S'So, after reading all the great reviews from all the local Yelpers that had a free meal here I had to come check it out. So , I came during a weekday at 11:30 and it was $45 errr ok . I am fine with that if it is good. \nThe good:\ngood layout and clean look, great deserts (crepes were perfect and gelato was supreme) , Potato Latkes, fresh juices and sliders\nThe bad:\nThe food was not of great quality overall, the Chinese food was old, mexican food was  limited, and it was considered brunch up until I left at 1:00 and still had mostly breakfast out. They are trying really hard to be Wicked spook with Tapas style items like them and really not coming close. fairly angry people working here other than the desert people which were really nice. \n\nI think they were good but not as good as Wicked Spoon or Studio B and probably even with the Bellagio.'

S'supposedly Bacchanal means "Feast for the Gods", but what\'s the most godly (most godly? godliest?) about this place is the definitely the hype. Bacchanal is an amazing buffet, true - but I think I\'ve had a few better. (Bellagio, Wynn, etc).\n\nit\'s a little pricey, and organization/service a tad slow. on a busy day (high season or weekends), you\'d probably have to go at like 4:30 pm to avoid a 1 hr+ wait. \nsomething unique/cool that Bacchanal does is have like a "fast pass" system of waiting in line. you put your name into a virtual line and they give you a time period you can return between so you don\'t have to physically wait in line. in theory, it sounds super impressive. only downside is that once you come back in your allotted time, it takes them impossibly long just to seat you.\n\nFOOD: I think this buffet\'s saving grace is its dessert selection. gelato, mochi, pastries, macarons galore! the desserts were definitely the highlight of my meal. they have an extensive seafood section with crab legs... but the wait for them was really long. some other highlights: meat & cheese section (I live for prosciutto!), dim sum and pho sections, chicken and waffles section\n\noverall... one of my top 5 favorite buffets in vegas, but probably not my first choice. that being said - I\'ll most likely be Bacch!

S"Pricey, but in terms of food quality, this buffet is great compared to the others.  When we went this 4th of July weekend, food didn't sit long under heat lamps like they do at some other buffets.  Even comfort food items, like mashed potatoes/macaroni and cheese I could tell were prepared with better ingredients.  \n\nCrab legs were pre-cut in half.  I normally don't enjoy crab at buffets, but at Bacchanal it was actually yummy.\n\nSelection is very plentiful and the desserts were great!  The gelato flavors were yummy too!  I recommend going during off peak hours so that waiting in line doesn't take away from the experience.  By the time we were finished eating and walked out of the buffet, the line was insane!"

S"Sadly, the quality at Bacchanal has dwindled since it started. The biggest hit is supposed to be the fresh oysters, but they were nasty as hell when I went. \n\nHowever, the best seafood dish would be the hot crab legs! Don't even have to wait in a line AND you're given a FULL plate! Best thing in the whole buffet!\n\nAlso, the juices! No, I don't mean the juices offered by the waiters. I'm talking about the ones at the station: guava, pineapple, horchata (not a juice but w/e), etc. These are soooo good, and you definitely can't find these at other places.\n\nThe copious amounts of desserts are also not to be messed with. So many choices of gelato are available! They even added shaved ice (hawaiian ice style) to the mix as well with toppings such as red beans, popping boba, and mochi. \n\nOverall, the food and selection is great! But, the quality is not as good as when it first started."

Had the flan which was very good, the creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e was ok since it was warm and wasn't as firm as crime br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e should be.

So I can't really complain. \n\nThe place is ultra modern and contemporary. I thought the service was a plus. Lots of different kinds of seats and like most buffets, the cuisine is vast with variety. I suggest coming here on a really empty stomach to get your money's worth. It was $41.99 for brunch, so pig out! \n\nI went to The Buffet at the Wynn and liked this one much better.

S"Meh -- just OK. This buffet was hyped up to us by Caesars staff during our last visit in August 2012 before it opened, so my fiance and I figured we'd stop by during our December visit to give it a try.\n\nPrice was more expensive than other buffets on the strip. With a Total Rewards card, our bill was $48 per person for dinner on Friday night. \n\nIt didn't feel like the food selection was much larger than the RIO buffet, but the selection was a bit better. If you're a seafood fan, which I am unfortunately not, there were quite a few choices. My fiance pigged out on the crab legs and said that that alone was worth the cost. I did like that they had a taco station where they grilled up some beef and had a wide variety of salsas and some seriously delicious guacamole. Besides that, nothing in the main food buffet stood out to me.\n\nThe dessert section was where I was actually impressed. The crepe station was a nice touch, wide selection of mochi, and some delicious macaroons. Yes, I did go up for seconds.\n\nIt was the service that really made this a 3 star (I'd give it 3.5 stars for just the food). One waiter was servicing a whole section and wasn't able to keep up with the seatings. It took 20 minutes (almost 1 dish) to get his attention then another 15 minutes to get water. The table next to us (and boy, some of the tables are close) tried to get an iced tea for almost 20 minutes before walking up to another waiter. The server didn't come back for water refills until the end of the meal and plates were piling up on all the tables around us. \n\nI probably would not make a return appearance at Bacchanal."

S"I went here for the breakfast buffet. The ambiance was quite nice with quiet music in the background. The brunch itself was more like a 4.5 in my opinion. I had eaten at The Wicked Spoon the day before and it was quite good but I believe Bacchanal did the same thing a little nicer and with better food. It was a dollar more and there weren't quite as many seafood options but the ones they did have were better and they might have more if you catch them when they are transitioning to lunch. The fresh juice (8 varieties) was nice and I think you had to order at TWS. Try the steak and eggs first if you like that sort of thing because you will want to hit that a few times."

S'Pros: \n\n- Good food\n- good selection\n- comfortable chairs\n\nCons:\n\n- inefficient staff causes long line to get in\n- spotty table service\n- carpet not well cleaned/maintained\n- "Express pass" is a joke and waste of money\n\nBottom line: good food, but not worth the long wait in line.\n\nMy girlfriend and I make it a habit to try one high-end buffet every time we come to Vegas. We had heard and read good things about Bachhanal, so decided to try it. We went on a Sunday night about 7:30, figuring the line wouldn\'t be so bad. Wrong!!!! We got there only to see a long-ass line that reminded us of a popular nightclub. There is a little machine where you check in and it gave us a ticket that told us to return in 77 minutes to be seated. Or, you could pay $20 apiece to skip the line. We decided to do this, but I was pissed with the result as we did NOT get to skip the line- instead they just place you in another line with people who came back after waiting their 77 minutes. What a ripoff. The dinner price was $53 apiece (before the $20 express charge).\n\nAnyway, after 30 minutes of waiting in the express line, we were finally seated. I was appalled at what we saw- open table after open table. Several were not cleaned yet which told me their bussing service is lacking. It also was very clear that they either don\'t care about people in line or are purposely making them wait there as nightclubs do very often- to make it look like a "hot" place that everyone has to eat at. Either way, it\'s disgusting.\n\nThere was a great selection of food- seafood, Chinese, sushi, American, Italian, and a small salad bar. They also had a huge dessert bar with an excellent selection. We especially liked their sea bass (with wasabi mashed potatoes and Bok choi), the sweet potato tater tots, Asian green beans, king crab legs, shrimp dumplings, and custard dumplings. \n\nOur server was ok, but would sometimes disappear for lengths of time. Plates were cleared quickly, however. My girlfriend noticed food on the carpet in several areas. Disappointing given the stature of the place and the fact it wasn\'t even full ( don\'t get me going on THAT again). \n\nOverall, we liked the food, but were disappointed with other aspects of our experience. We think the buffets at the Wynn and Cosmopolitan were better and were about the same price. We would come back to Bacchanal, but only if there were no line (or a very small one).'

S'"The $17,000,000 Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace offers a feast that boasts more than 500 options and may well take the ongoing battle of Las Vegas buffets to a new level. Bacchanal Buffet premiered on September 11th after a complete wall-to-wall renovation from the previous Lago Buffet and will likely become a culinary mainstay like the Carnival World Buffet, which opened over two decades ago." - Chris Rauschnot, The Huffington Post\n\nSo good ol\' rich Caesar decided he was bored of his crapLago Buffet [finally] and decided to do something with his endless stack of pure and unadulterated cash to fix the main culinary mess in his own backyard. Although having expected much less, pumping $17 million just means that from launch and to a certain extent of time...this buffet is going to be - for lack of better words - G.R.E.A.T. But this article also mentions the Carnival World Buffet (by the way, is no longer that great...) as a parallel, which serves one main point...this place will only be good for "so long". SO GET YOUR GLUTTON ARSE OVER HERE QUICK...while it is still this freaking G.R.E.A.T.\n\nService is great as the staff definitely display their enthusiasm to work at the "best buffet" in Vegas (loved how the cashier reiterated that to us SEVERAL times). Need refills? It comes automatically. Need your plates to disappear? No, you don\'t need to chuck it under the table...they efficiently disappear on their own - even if you\'re a speedy little punk like me (gone and back within a minute with another full plate).\n\nSo after coming here several times for both lunch and dinner, I would recommend lunch if you don\'t want to break your wallet since the difference between both meals is minimal. If you have the 24-hour-Buffet pass, please note that you\'ll need to pay an extra $16\'ish bucks per entry.\n\nSummary of my main LIKES (this is what I come here for):\n\n- EVERYTHING AT THE CARVING STATION: really tender and juicy prime rib, fall off the bone baby back ribs, luscious lamb chops, sausages and more!\n- Steamed crab legs\n- Fresh raw oysters: one of few times I would recommend RAW oysters at a buffet (additional Japanese version at dinner)\n- GIANT cocktail shrimps...holy crap, these are the 5-8/lb types!\n- Ginseng chicken soup and Chinese BBQ (especially the char siew...gives Sam Woo a run for its money - now that\'s something)\n- Cheese and prosciutto section (used these on my salads)\n- Bottled fruit juices (lunch only)\n- DESSERTS: non-sweetened desserts such as the cheesecake was a plus for me!\n\nCaesar made the right decision with his "back-anal" (bacch-anal) investment and is definitely raking in the profits once again to Rome. \n\nI definitely RECOMMEND this Vegas buffet (for now - before it eventually ends up like Carnival World Buffet)!'

S'I love buffets but  i think didnt have a big appetite that day! Came here for lunch and there was barely a line! $35 a person. The design of this place looks amazing! Food was literally everywhere! Only disappointment I had about this place when I asked for a plate of salmon sashimi with no rice the chef said something I couldnt understand. I had a ton of shrimp cocktails and a few oysters! I didnt eat any of the pasta but they looked delicious as well the salami and cheese station.\n\nLoved the desserts! Crepes and different flavored ice cream were my favorite!'

S"after hearing all the hype about how good this new buffet was, i decided that i must try this place the next time i go to vegas... so i actually did try it when i was in vegas couple of days ago..\n\ni waited for 3.5 hours just to get inside.. i didnt know they have express line where you have to pay an extra $20 until i was about 1 hour away from the front line.. i probably would have get that i had known earlier.. and since its holiday season, they jack up the price of the buffet to $50/person.. for $50/person, i expect a really good quality of foods and services. \n\nat the end of my 3.5hours of waiting, i finally inside and was able to feed my starving stomach.. i didnt really have lunch that day to save room for this buffet and it was 9.30pm by the time i got seated.. so i couldnt help myself being greedy and took more than what i could eat!! \n\n- their asian section - i like the spicy fried fish in the chinese section.. its perfectly fried with a hint of spiciness.. the sashimi in the japanese section was pretty good and fresh also.. i got quite alot of them but my favorite dish of this section was the ginseng chicken soup.. i wished they have a stronger ginseng flavor, but its still goo regardless.\n\n- salad section was average.. i didnt really try any of their salad.. i mean i could have gone anywhere if i wanna eat salad.. but i did try the watermelon and cheese salad simply bcoz it was presented nicely.. nothing special about the taste.\n\n- meat section - after all the wait i had to endure to get inside this place, i needed to wait another 30mins to get the meat.. im not a meat eater to begin with, but my bro is a meat eater.. so i got this for him.. he said that the lamb chop was his favorite and i also think that they did a really good job in cooking the lamb. the beef brisket was okay, the rib wasnt so good, and the steak was pretty dry.. they also have quite a good selections of the fried stuffs next to the meat counter. the sweet potato fries is a must try, its so good and sweet.. the rest was just so so..\n\n- seafood section - this is my main reason of wanting to come here.. i wanted to try their seafood... i love their shrimp cocktail.. it was so juicy and fresh.. clams was pretty good too, the lobster bisque was average, and the crab legs was a disappointment. both the hot and cold crab legs didnt taste as good as i'd expect.. it had too much water inside and too salty.. the oyster and oyster shooter was also yummy and something u must get if u like oyster.. and they have some shrimp tomato cup too, which i didnt really like..\n\n- dessert - one of the dessert buffets ive tried in vegas.. the quality, variety, and taste was just as good as it gets. their gelato and mochi ice cream was refreshing and has unique flavors. the cakes and tiramisu was delish.. the panna cotta and cake pop was also yummy.. but my favorite of the night was their creme brule.. love both the chocolate and vanilla one.. the crispiness of the sugar on top with all those egg and milky stuffs underneath.. im drooling again as im writing this..!! they also have the suger free creme brule if u want to cut some calories down!!\n\npretty good service.. out server kept refilling our drinks and kept on coming back to take the dirty plates away... even though i dont think i ate $50 worth of food, i still think it was a good experience and might come back for their brunch"

S'After spending 80 bucks per person ($ 20 for express lane) to avoid the 3.5 hr wait, you would think their food or service would be top notch, but NOOOOOO..... They are nothing spectacular to adjust for the money spent..... The lines to get the popular food are long, 15-20 min wait for the meats, have to wait for them to shuck the oysters every time, have to wait for pho because they ran out, have wait for cooked crab legs because they ran out...... wait, wait, wait....... and the kicker is they try to enforce the 2 hour dinning time on us while tables all around us were either empty or not clean up yet. Of the 2+ hrs there, we probably waited another 50 min just to get food, maybe they should worry more about improving their service and food and try to make customers happy... what a rip off...'

S'Bacchanal Buffet is by far the best buffet I have ever tried in Las Vegas and overall in my life! A few friends and I went for Sunday brunch/lunch, and the wait was only around 20-25 minutes. The quality of the food is superior, and I highly recommend going to this buffet. First off, the mimosas are bottomless. How can you go wrong with that? The food ranges from dim sum to pad thai to yellow chicken curry to clam chowder to steamed crab legs (that are already cracked open for you) to shrimp (that is already peeled) to dishes that are served on little hot plates. The variety is endless. In addition, the atmosphere of the buffet is classy, modern, and elegant. I was blown away by Bacchanal, and I would definitely go back again.. and again!'

It's under 25/person! Food taste in general very delicious, I was very satisfied! Second time came on a Sunday. It was their Sunday brunch, unlimited champaign and mimosa, I am not a big drinker and I could do without it. The food is still very good, and added the crab leg. Crab leg is very fresh and tasty compare to other buffets I have been to in vegas. It was 50/person\n\nBut I would prefer just to come during weekday.. I could do without the crab leg and mimosa."

The crab legs and shrimp cocktail were really good.  The oysters on the other hand were pretty bland.  i really liked the wagyu beef slider but it does fill you up.  Also there was a polento thing with truffles which was crazy good.\n\nAfter eating here,  I was really glad i didn't buy the Buffet of buffets.. i could not imagine eating anything else for at least 24 hours."

S'Seems smaller than the M Resort buffet, but has better quality food. Serving style similar to Wicked Spoon with individual food items pre-plated on small plates. My favorite items were the roast duck and spicy tuna roll on Asian station, but they couldn\'t keep the ahi poke and crab salad stocked. There were at least 4 "chefs" behind the counter that never addressed the customers or seem to care if the items were stocked or not. It wasn\'t very busy and I went back 3 times and they never had more than two of each or less. Mac and Cheese was fabulous, Seafood station was good, but nothing spectacular. Lobster Corn Chowder had corn, but no lobster. The Halibut and Salmon plates were okay. They were blanching pre-cracked Crab legs to order, so that was a nice variation. They had a smoked meat station, pizza station, cured meat station, Mexican food station, none of which I didn\'t try mainly because the items didn\'t look or were not presented special. The fried food station had fried chicken that was horrible, overcooked and dry. The Dessert station had fresh baked dessert Souffle\' that were good. The Crepe\' station was good, all other dessert items typical. They had Macaroon\'s (not the coconut ones, the cookie looking ones) which I haven\'t seen on a buffet, however, not made in house. They purchase them pre-made. I know this because when the were stocking the dessert station with them, they brought them out in the boxes they came in, pre frozen. Why they would bring them out in the boxes is beyond me. I didn\'t want to know that this item isn\'t made in house. That said, they were pretty good, for a pre-made frozen, boxed, purchased product. Overall very good buffet, but for the price paid and the buffet attendant service provided, ($86 for two adults and 1 child, 11yrs at the lunch prices, before the tip) I have to give it three stars only. Doesn\'t live up to the hype, (hype being this buffet is different because 90% food made to order on live action stations) Typical poor service from buffet attendents. This does not include the dessert station, where the attendents were friendly, accommodating and engaging.'

S"In my opinion, it's a great quality buffet! $55 for dinner, but I ate my money's worth and everything I chose was delicious!\n\nCan't remember every item, but here are the one I really liked:\n\nLots of fresh king crab legs that already cracked for you. All you need to do is pluck out the meat. I ate hella.\n\nPrime rib was juicy red. Satisfies the carnivore in me. \n\nLobster macaroni- big chunks of lobster!!\n\nFresh oysters- yum! They're putting them out though- it's on purpose. Dress pretty, as all ladies should try in Vegas, and the cook might hand you some freshly chucked ones!\n\nThe sweet potato fries- omg soo good! I usually don't care for these type of fries, but these are coated with roasted sesame seeds and ginger honey (I believe) and it takes it to another level!\n\nYum mochi, macarons, and an array of unique flavors of ice cream for dessert! You can also ask them to make you fresh crepe and strawberry dipped chocolate!\n\nPresentation on the foods are lovely. Ambience is modern, clean and very pretty. It's next to the pools, and the windows give off a beautiful natural lighting.\n\nTips: Dinner is at 3PM. Come at least 45 minutes before (waiting in line took us 30 min) that time so you can pay the lunch fee instead of dinner fee. We were late because we hung out too long at MGM pool. Got there before 3, but the line of course took longer than we hoped.\n\nAvoid the carbs! Don't drink too much liquids. Eat the SEAFOOD and prime rib!!!"

S'I was very excited to try this extravagant and hyped up feast. But in the wise words of Public Enemy "dont believe the hype." This was a disappointing feast to say the least. A friend and I went and luckily were spared a 2 hour line and instead only waited 15 min. The staff was friendly and as we were being walked to our table the hostess showed us where everything was and gave us her recommendations. \n\nThe selection of food is good with some unique features such as a taco stand (one of the few really good things there) and a noodle stand where they will make you ramen or pho dishes (which are just meh). Most of the food is typical buffet food which is expected to be just ok because its in fact just a buffet, but at $55 I expect a level of quality higher than the norm. I went to the carver part of the buffet and saw a good selections of meats like prime rib, roast, duck, and rack of lamb. I decided to try the lamb and regretted that decision  immediately.  It was completely inedible and that is not a word I use lightly. The meat had a taste similar to burnt rubber with a similar consistency. The dessert section was really good with a wide selection of gelato various pastries including macaroons and cheese cake pops. \n\nI may of just fell victim to the hype of this place and had a bitter taste in my mouth because of its failure to live up to it or the inedible food that they served,  whatever the reason I could not justify giving it above 2 stars.'

The chicken soup was good. 2nd trip around, everything was cold...but the lamb chop was good.\n\nWe got in at 8 pm, it's unacceptable that anything should be cold or taste like it's been left out for too long especially if it was busy... doesn't make any sense.\n\nThe desserts and service were decent; tonkatsu ramen was surprisingly good.

Excuse the sob story, but when you grow up in poverty and have had dreams of all different kinds of food all racked up and displayed for your pleasure.

Friday night, we got there at 6:40 the wait was around 10 minutes and even got a casino comp of 10 dollars and 10% off our meal from one of the staff while waiting.

I heard about the 1.5 hour amusement park-like lines, so we decided to come for a late lunch/early dinner.\n\nBEST BUFFET in Vegas! Why the 4 stars instead of 5 you ask? The lunch selection was a bit cheaper, but the quality wasn't nearly as good as the dinner quality. Also the way the buffet is arranged is that the prime rib and the seafood sections are very close together, so the line is VERY LONG and and SLOW.\n\nTips:\n1) $15 for express line\n2) Dinner selection, which tastes wayyy better starts at 3:00pm.\n3) Come early for quicker entry. If you're coming during peak times, you better not have anything else planned for the night because you'll spend the whole evening there standing in line and eating.\n\nCuisines: There are more, but it's too extensive for me to include everything.\nChinese (Peking duck-AMAZING, chow mein, soup, etc...), \nJapanese (some nigiri, rolls, ramen), \nMexican (soups, \nItalian (pizza, pasta, etc...)\nBBQ (ribs, brisket, sausages)\nSteak (Prime Ribs\nSeafood (oysters, crabs, mussels, shrimp cocktail, oyster shooters)\nFried foods: (chicken, tater tots, sweet potato tots, etc...)\n\nEssentially, they something for EVERY taste and preference.\n\nDesserts:\nThe dessert station is huge!

S"When deciding to go to Vegas, what was I most excited about? Brunch Buffet! \n\nBrunch is my favorite meal, and while I am not usually a fan of buffets, I do love unlimited champagne, fresh waffles, omelet bars, crepes, biscuits and gravy. The Bachanal Buffet at Caesar's Palace had all these things! \n\nIt's $40+ per person, but definitely worth it. Brunch is only on the weekends, so it's definitely busy. I'd suggest getting there by 10 am, or end up having a really long wait. They do serve brunch until 3 pm though. We got there around 10 am and ended up having about a 20 minute wait. \n\nWe were seated at a cozy, remote table. Our hostess told us the table is usually reserved for recently married people, but since she hadn't had any yet, she thought she'd give it to us. \n\nWe had coffee and mimosas/champagne from the get go. Our glasses were never empty. \n\nObviously not everything was a hit, but all in all my boyfriend and I were extremely happy. \n\nHe was happy about all the crab legs, although they weren't Alaskan King Crab. \n\nMy favorites: \n-Omelet Bar\n-Waffles that I topped with whip cream and nutella\n-Prime Rib\n-Biscuits and gravy\n-Crepes(which you top yourself, I was a huge fan of the raspberry jam)\n-Charcuterie\n-Chinese BBQ Pork\n-UNLIMITED CHAMPAGNE\n\nThe dessert station is one of the real stars too, and they even have gelato. \n\nThe Buffet space is recently updated too, and absolutely beautiful. I think it's been voted #1 in Vegas, by someone, I don't know. But I am telling you it's delicious, and I am a fatty, so you should listen to me. \n\nNext time I am in Vegas, I will definitely plan it so I can come back to Bachanal for more Sunday Champagne Brunch!"

However it's worth the wait, the seafood was fresh, with crab legs, raw oysters, and clam bakes. The meat on the otherhand was a little disappointing, everything but the prime rib and ribs were dry and unappetizing. They serve  wagyu beef sliders, Mexican (pozole, rice, beans), Italian (meatballs, rigatoni), Antipasto, Japanese (sushi and udon), and Chinese food (dim sum and black chicken soup). If you're a dessert person you should come here, very similar to wicked spoon, but more variety. They even have mochi gelato, my favorite! I ate my worth by eating all the macarons and mochi ice cream, and anything on the dessert section like the candies in the jar can be eaten, not just for decor. It might be better to save your appetite for the prime rib and crab legs."

I wish the age for paying children was 5 years old. My daughter is 4 and although I paid for her, she barely ate! All she had was 1/2 a juice and 1/4 of a char Sui bao. I should've called to see what their seafood selection was for Sunday brunch. Unfortunately there were no oysters, which is what he really wanted. The crab legs had to do! Overall the food was good. Decent selection, but for the price I think it's better to come for dinner. As with most buffets we've been to there are always a few items that have been out too long. I don't remember our servers name, but he was ok. Not the worst and not the best. He couldn't get our drink order- 2 Reg coffees, 1 decaf and 4 waters. We got the 2 coffees and 3 waters.

The chili and little tacos were probably the best things we had..... We were really disappointed. Everything was cold or melted by the time we got it back to our table. This buffet would be absolutely amazing if all of the various foods they served that look so great, were actually good....

There are a lot of options to choose from many different type of regions. I just wished they had some Mediterranean food. Tables and chair are comfortable to sit on. Some are even more plush than others. \nSometimes the seafood line merges with the carvery line which sometimes causes confusion. I see people wanting seafood  waiting in the very back of the line for carvery station. I got called out by someone for going into the seafood line and they wanted me to wait in the back of the carvery line, no one cared that I went into the seafood line, just that one person. After the altercation quite of few people who was at the carvery line just started to line up behind me because they wanted seafood, I guess. \nI love their new system of getting into the buffet. They have a kiosk where you sign in to get a ticket telling you when you can come back to the buffet. It's a pretty smart idea, you can kill time by gambling, drinking, or whatever before your check-in window, instead of waiting in line for hours to get seated. Just don't forget to bring that ticket with you.\n\nI would recommend coming here if you want to pig out and spend a lot of cash."

S"I made the mistake of trying to come here during Christmas/New Years week. All buffets on the strip had 2+ hour waits and we were actually turned away from Bacchanal on the day we were trying to go because we got there too late (7:30pm... peak dinner time). So the next day we tried to go first thing in the morning which was about 12:30pm... lol (obviously slept way too late). So there was already a line for the kiosk, but it was about a 5 min wait. We pulled a ticket and it said to come back at 5:35, which is pretty much a 5 hour wait!! I was in disbelief, but at least we didn't have to stay and wait so I wasn't mad about it.\n\nSo was it worth the wait? YES!!! And before you call BS, keep reading. It was only about a 5 min wait to pull the ticket, and then we were free to do whatever we wanted until 5:30pm. And there are sooo many things to do while waiting at Caesars. We played some table games, and filled up on free beer while playing video poker at the bar. We were entertained for free for hours since we pretty much broken even in all our gambling (plus free drinks!!). It was a very productive use of time! At about 3:30ish, they texted us saying we can come back earlier to eat. From then on, it was about a 45 min wait to pay and get seated.\n\nNow, I work in a manufacturing environment, so I appreciate efficiency when I see it... This buffet literally serves hundreds, maybe even thousands a day. And even though the wait was so long, I honestly think this is the best it gets considering how high in demand this restaurant is. Even the seating was incredibly efficient and it literally blew my mind. The hostess seats about 6-10 tables at a time. They never asked how many people in our party when we got to the front, they just knew somehow.\n\nThe food was pretty damn good quality for buffet food. The quality was comparable to a mid-price range restaurant. Some of the dishes I would go as far to say it's on par with high end restaurants. I felt like the tiny dishes seem to be more tasty than the ones that are mass prepared (such as barbecue). There were some dishes that weren't so great, but nothing that I tried (and I tried a looot) was terrible. The most amazing thing I had here was the pork belly sauteed with lentils, and the Mango Habanero ice cream. The dessert bar is just... outstanding. Dessert is my biggest weakness and the selection is so extensive it nearly killed me. \n\nAll in all, I was blown away by everything in this buffet... even though the wait is very long, it doesn't feel like waiting at all. The food was much better than expected and the selection is incredible. This was well worth the $60 we paid to eat here (holiday pricing)."

S'One of the best buffets in Vegas. It will cost you an arm and a leg to eat here but is definitely worth it. The seafood is awesome. A great selection and variety of ethic food. I also enjoyed their Asian food. The Mexican food was decent. I mainly stayed in the seafood, Asian, and dessert section. Service is great. We had 2 servers tending to us.'

S"Came here for dinner, we waited about 45 minutes I think which isn't too bad. \n\nStarted off with the pricey stuff to make sure I got my money's worth before I got full. A plate full of crab legs and oysters. I liked the warmed crab legs, a lot of buffets don't offer that but they have both options here and always plentiful. Oysters were good too, you have to do a little picking for the better ones. On my second round of oysters they were not opened/cleaned very well, a lot of shell and debris was on them.\n\nSecond round was meats. Prime rib, I asked for a medium rare cut and he got me a piece more in the middle and it was tender and juicy and not over cooked. Lamb chops were delicious too! Also juicy and not dry. Be careful though, the meats all tend to be on the saltier side. They have horseradish that is very spicy! I love spicy and this one was right up my alley. \n\nThird plate was all the random, cheaper things, that I wanted to try. I had two bowls of ramen. The broth was surprisingly good and flavorful, like the bones was cooked for a long time to get that rich broth taste. However, due to the noodles being made to order and just one guy helping out, they were under done. I don't mind al dente a little but these were barely blanched. They also have a large variety of Asian/Chinese food. I had the rice porridge with thousand year old egg, YUM. Very comforting after a day of drinking and being in the sun. \n\nLast plate was desserts. Nothing stood out, they have a very good macaroon, but this one you really have to wait and be a vulture about if you want to get some. I was in line and this one kid was hovering all over the empty platter waiting for it, and when it did come he took half the plate, had to fight my way in for just one cookie. \n\nOverall I enjoyed my meal here, still a little more than I would want to pay for but I didn't mind as much because most everything I had was good."

S'I have been craving getting down with a buffet for a LONG time now - blame it on a year of wedding planning and watching what I eat - but the last few months I have constantly been saying to my hubby "Let\'s just drive to LV and buffet!!" Of course he would look at me and say "Uh huh...sure sure" bc obviously driving 5 hours to stuff oneself is not very practical.\n\nFinally, though, we came with some friends/fam for July 4th weekend (note to self - avoid the 7/4 weekend! Absolute havoc). After reading good reviews for the new Caesar\'s buffet we decided to do Bacchanal the morning before we drove back to LA. We dragged our butts up at 8am, got a workout in (to reduce the guilt a smidge) and I sent the hubby to get in line at 9am. When he showed up, though, there was absolutely nobody there AND there was an early bird special to pay I believe $32.99 instead of 40.99 if you come before 9:30am. If you have a Total Rewards card you get $1.00 off too.\n\nOf course the problem with being an early bird is that the "better" stuff may not be there (ie the more unique dinner items, etc.). There was a great spread though - fresh crepes, pancakes, waffles, eggs, pastries, gelato, fruit, salads, salsa, chinese food, meats (prime rib, ribs, sausages), cute little mini meals (ie small corned beef hashes), enough fried food to clog at least one artery per person, shrimp cocktail and king crab legs, omelets made to order, deserts, etc. etc. The food was certainly plentiful but as always, quantity does not make up for quality. The best thing was the king crab legs while everything else was subpar - unfortunately, the small pre-made portions = dried out food. There wasn\'t anything especially unique or delicious. The shrimp were slimy and a lot of the food just didn\'t seem that freshly made. \n\nAll said, it was OK but didn\'t wow me or show me why it was deserving of being the "best buffet." Of course, we still stuffed oursevlves silly - I mean, we did just plunk down some $$ (we ate so much we didn\'t actually eat anything again until 8/9pm that night. And even then all I could muster room up for was some fruit).'

S"I had it all planned out. Vegas Buffets 101, some tips from buddies (Thanks Leona for the last minute answers!)- the best time to go to a buffet is between shifts! \n\nThat's when u get to sample both lunch and dinner at Lunch Price!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nI lost a battle and ended up going for dinner at around 4pm, not like j had planned, and after seeing gorgeous displays of desserts, tons of yummy looking stations, you forget about the 40 plus dollars you shelled out. But it all worked out in the end. Cuz you don't have to wait that extra time letting your stomach bloat up waiting for the seafood to come out. You hit that first to make sure you get your money's worth! \n\nNo king crab, but snow crab was decent. Especially since they cut it for you already, so no crab juice in your neighbors eye. I ate plenty. \n\nStarting from the far end, there's the chinese section (WALNUT SHRIMP was my fave). They have chowmein, fried rice, eggrolls, stir fry, some dim sum dishes, spicy eggplant, yummy greenbeans.\nThey have Pho, Japo station sucked. Miso soup, sushi rolls. (what i would have loved to have seen for shelling out 50 bucks was some decent sashimi, and maybe some tempura!)\nTaco station was pretty cool, although i didn't get eat much from this station. \nCheese and cold cuts\nSmall build your own salad section and small plates of caprese salad\nAbout 5 different pizzas\nMeat section: prime rib, ribs, chops, brisket. damn it, i missed the rib eye lollies.\nLittle pasta, a good fried section: Calamari, sweet potato tater tots, fries, fish and chips\nCrab, shrimp, oysters, mussels, fish dishes.  You can get either steamed crab legs or chilled ones. (steamed is in another section)\nHUGE dessert section.\n\nThis was my favorite (obviously).\nI got French Toast Gelato, Thai iced tea gelato (pretty cool selection),\nmacarons, cookies, cupcakes, tiramisu, chocolate cream brulee, cakes galore, cake pops. I saw a crepe station, bread pudding... lots o stuff i didn't have room for.\n\nAlthough i loved gorging myself, there were only a few items that i totally loved. The rest was good, but i'm not sure it was 50 bucks worth good. I would come again for sure, but definitely sticking to my guns to come at the lunch price. \n\n* i went on a monday around 4pm and walked right in. But weekends, i hear can be hours of waiting! Be prepared!"

S"I wish I could teleport back to Bacchanal. I would do it six times, once for every hour the $55 price tag allots you.  Guys, it's expensive, but so worth it.  Two giant rooms, filled wall to wall with every delicacy you could possibly want, and it's all done well.  Sigh.\n\nThere's a guy who will make you street tacos.  A guy who will steam your crab legs.  Sliders that I'll remember fondly for the rest of my life.  Lamb chops that melt in your mouth.  A Chinese section.  A Japanese section.  An Italian section.  Pace yourself and get small portions so you can try it all!\n\nThe dessert table gets its own paragraph.  There are ladies who will scoop you gelato.  Perfect creme brulee.  Someone else is cooking crepes to order.  Cupcakes.  Cake pops.  Chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nIf you only eat one meal in Vegas for the duration of your stay, pick Bacchanal!"

S"I not really an avid buffet-goer, but I really do recommend Bacchanal! While the wait can get horrendous...I felt that the food made up for it! The miniature individual buckets of seafood tickled my fancy, and it was all adorable and delicious. I felt that the dishes they had offered a little bit more complexity than other buffets. For instance, they had this really good shrimp over polenta,sitting in  a little plate of sauce. Normally at other buffets, you get shrimps in a dish, polenta off to the side, and the sauce nowhere to be found. I loved how they had everything together for me in a miniature slice of heaven. All in all I was pleased for the $40 i payed to get in. Also, you can't really go wrong with spicy chocolate gelato for dessert."

S'Understandably there is a wait for Christmas week but to have an "express" check-in service to wait in line 2 hours (and we still didn\'t get in) was crazy. We arrived at 10:45am and I checked in and the express ticket showed 11:08 am. I was happy until I found out we had to wait in another line. Still not mad but understood the wait would be long. After over an hour and a half wait to be told we need to wait another hour was ridiculous. And to see another line just keep being let in when I\'m the the damn express line is crazy. This place is horribly managed and its sad because I heard so many good things. The person in front of me had a verbal brawl with the cashier and was barley let in cause he threw a couple f bombs. I mean is that how to get into this buffet? It\'s sad because I had such high hopes and this was supposed to be the highlight meal of the trip. This is not the way to treat paying hotel guests. We were next in line at the cashier after over 2 hours and still another hour wait (looked like 2 hours) because one line kept being let ahead of us for over an hour. No food is worth that. We walked over to another better managed restaurant and met some great locals and unexpectedly had a great meal. Maybe I\'ll try this place on a Monday morning after a big weekend and campout the night before for an express ticket to be told I\'m next in line only to eat on Friday dinner.'

S"Hands down, Bacchanal Buffet is the BEST buffet on the Vegas strip!\n\nMy recent trip to Vegas led me to staying at the Caesar's Palace hotel and instead of us traveling somewhere else on the strip to get our last meal in before heading back home, we decided to give the Bacchanal Buffet downstairs a try and I was not disappointed.\n\nAMBIENCE:\nThe line to get in is long and for good reason - the food is GOOD!  \n\n*Tip:  Make sure you bring your Player's Club Card.  If you don't have one, make sure you visit the Player's Card Booth to sign up!  You will get a few dollars off of your buffet.  I got the mimosa buffet and the total came out to be $40 on a weekend.\n\nThe seating inside is made to make you feel like it is spacious and open.  The beautiful blue glass decoratively placed throughout the restaurant makes the restaurant look very modern and clean.\n\nFOOD QUALITY:\nThere is A LOT of variety here. For my very very particular parents, they could not stop raving about how wonderful the Asian section of the buffet was.  For myself, I could not resist the fried chicken (fried chicken, i love you!!) pho, and desserts. There seems to be something for everyone here - desserts, seafood, juices, red velvet pancakes, fries, tator tots, breakfast foods, sausages and other meats, italian food, mexican food, salads, noodles, sushi, and other Asian dishes.\n\nSome of the more memorable dishes:\n*There was actually meat on the crab legs and they tasted fresh!\n*The skin of the fried chicken was absolutely delicious!  The chicken also was super tender.\n* LOVED the noodle station.  *TIP:  Don't miss the noodle station! They serve pho!  The broth was delicious, the noodles were tender - one of the best pho I have had.\n* Dim sum - Ha gow is my favorite dim sum dish and they really got it right!  The shrimp inside was tender, tasty, and fresh!\n* Chow mein was amazing!  I had to go for seconds - packed with flavor!\n* I kept getting the coffee - it was so good and paired perfectly with my dessert.\n\nSERVICE:\nWhat sets Bacchanal Buffet apart from the other buffets on the strip is the service.  From the moment we sat down, our waitress was SUPER accommodating and on top of it!  She kept our coffee and the tea coming and came back very frequently to take away our dishes.  You will notice that it is not just the waitresses/waiters but the entire staff of Bacchanal.  You guys have it together and what a breath of fresh air it is to see!  Even those that are serving you from behind the buffet line are smiley and ready to help.  It truly made our experience here that much better!\n\nOVERALL:\nI have found my new favorite buffet on the Vegas strip.  Because of my wonderful experience here, I definitely have Bacchanal as a required stop to visit on my list whenever I come back to Vegas.  If you haven't come here yet, what are you waiting for? You deserve to give your taste buds some TLC!! :)"

S"One of the best buffets out there in Vegas! Price isn't too bad, $42 for lunch. I came here two weeks ago and the wait wasn't too long, a 40 minute wait for lunch. It was one of the better buffets I've had. The food was very good with a HUGE variety. Presentation of the food was nice and it tasted great. Plenty of fresh crab and oysters. You can even get it steamed hot if you like. Their tacos were excellent, wide variety of cheeses, caprese salad, watermelon and feta, and the beets salad were refreshing. Prime rib was good...sushi was fresh! They even had ramen! \n\nI loved their dessert section! It was phenomenal! I had to try a bite of everything! They even had French macaroons and mochi! The gelato bar was amazing and not to forget the homemade crepes. I had so much food, I was stuffed!"

If so then they do have orange beer sorbet and mango habanero gelato which was a little different from the norm. It was spicy for sure!\n\nCrab legs hot or cold was okay! They plate it for you which isn't bad and keeps from people hogging it so I do like that. Too bad no dungeoness crab tho! Prime rib wasn't bad, lamb chops were good but again... Nothing memorable. I did like the Chinese chicken wings with lots of flavor but a little salty. Oysters were not fresh at all and super obvious for those who eat them on a regular. \n\nGo on a off hour and you'll be seated in 30-45 minutes otherwise plan on waiting forever!"

S"A plate of fancy desserts, a plate of carved meats & BBQ, while slurping a bowl of beef pho and tonkotsu ramen. Don't. f*ck. up. this. rotation.\n\nExcited to see that Ceasars Palace was finally opening the doors of its highly anticipated $7 million buffet, Vegas buffets are very similar to one another (all equipped with seafood, carving station, fancy dessert station, etc). Generally, new buffets start off very well, so we jumped to try this before it begins to spiral down in quality (all buffets eventually do this).\n\nBacchanal seems to have adapted a lot of Wicked Spoon ideas like the brilliantly idiotic concept of individually plating items in dishes/pots/pans/mini-deep fryers so that items do not fit on your existing buffet plate \n(Why does fancy plating mean that we have to further frequently pace back and forth for more food?)\nBut, all in all, the food at Bacchanal is a solid buffet competitor to Wynn, Cosmo, & Bellagio.\n\nThe perfect time to go to a Vegas buffet is right before lunch ends (2:30).  \n(Props to Justin Y.)\nThat way:\n1. You avoid peak rush hours and the death line wrapped around the corner. \n2. You pay for the lunch price, while dinner items are new and slowly filter in at stations. I.E Crab legs were were not offered for lunch, but appeared later during our meal\n3. Going out at night? Luckily for you, you had a late lunch/early dinner so you will feel like less of a whale in that tight dress.\n\n\nBacchanal Back-anal jokes aside, this place is recommended"

S"I would have never thought that I would have two best evers in one weekend:  the best ever hamburger and fries at Bachi Burgers and the best ever buffet at The Bacchanal Buffet.  Coincidentally, best evers occurred at restaurants that start with the letter B.  The sad thing is that these best evers are located in Las Vegas, NV, approximately 4.5 hours away.  Come to think about it, that might be a blessing in disguise for my girly figure.\n\nThe Bacchanal Buffet is situated within the confines of Caesar's Palace, which should give you an idea of the cost of the buffet.  We decided on Sunday brunch, thinking that going in the morning would be more economical.  It was cheaper than dinner, but expect to hand over your wallet to experience what I consider to be the best ever buffet anywhere.  Don't let the cost keep you away.  The Bacchanal is a must visit destination for quality, delicious, and belt busting food.  For adults during brunch, we paid $41 per person, with our children under 12 at about half that price.  It is evident right away that you're about to indulge in some high end foodie fare by the high end decor.  The hanging, glass adornments covering the lights gave that exclusive appearance.  What really sold me that I was about experience some high end, quality food were the lounge type sofas our party of 9 sat in.  Sofas, not chairs.\n\nBacchanal is gluttony personified.  As is customary whenever I eat at a buffet, I recon the food choices to gameplan what I'm going to eat.  As I walked from one end of Bacchanal's buffet line to the other, it seemed endless with sensory overload from the large array of food.  And that was just the main food choices, not counting the dessert.  My eyes could eat more than what my stomach could handle, so I couldn't eat everything, but did I want to.  You will be amazed by the quality and the number of choices.  Everything was delicious and the variety was amazing.  \n\nI had three plates of food to get my money's worth.  The highlights of the first plate were the biscuit and gravy, premium cut of bacon from a slab, hot link sausage, and made to order omelette.  2nd plate highlights were the cold shrimp with cocktail sauce, sushi variety, fresh double meat pizza, and tuna poki.  3rd plate was all dessert and everything that I sampled, which included cheesecake, strawberry cheesecake and toasted coconut gelato, chocolate chip cookie, apple pie, pecan sticky bun, and bread pudding were all yummy and delicious.  Everything I ate was fresh, had quality ingredients, and emanated a feeling that food was prepared with a lot of care.\n\nMove over Wicked Spoon, there's a new champ that can call itself the best ever buffet.  The Bacchanal can lay claim to this distinction.  A visit to Las Vegas can't be complete without a buffet from at least one hotel and casino.  If you want to make that visit complete, might as well go to the best ever:  The Bacchanal, hands down.  What I paid for was worth what my stomach got out of this buffet champion."

S"After seeing the line stretching into an endless maze that somehow folded upon itself eight times over, I figured the food here had to be really good, or there was a lot crazy people waiting. Either way, the group I was with heard all the buzz about this place and we walked helplessly to the end of the line.\n\nWe were only in line for about 3 minutes when someone from my group suggested we asked the people next to us (but further in line) how long they've been waiting--30 minutes. After waiting for another couple of minutes, we decide to take the express line instead. To be rational, we figured that it would've been the same, in terms of time and cost (15 dollars more + 18% tip per person in the express line) if we waited in the original line. And since there was 8 of us, we figured we would be paying gratuity anyway. \n\nIn comparison, we managed to snag a table for 8, at the peak of lunch buffet on a Sunday, 30-40 minutes earlier than the group that was 30 minutes ahead of us line. \n\nThe selection of food available at Bacchanal was beyond outstanding, and is something that seems to be a response to Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon Buffet and Wynn's Buffet. They do this really neat thing of steaming up crab legs by request, offer a wide array of juices, offer an extensive selection of meats, from brisket to prime rib and ham to sausages. They even have a full on gelato dessert station, next to a crepes station in the dessert area. I remember coming back several times for this green pesto based pasta, I don't remember the name of it but it was definitely one of the stand out dishes available. \n\nI decided to give up on my diet that day (only so I wouldn't have count for all the calories), but I hope to make another visit when I'm back in town."

S"Writing this from the second time I came which is about a good little less than a year since it opened. First time I came with it was still barely new, I thought that this buffet was to beat from all the ones in Las Vegas. It used to be the Wynn Buffet for me until Bacchanal came about. Many great selection of food and dessert so what's not to love about it? Though this is all true from all hyped expensive buffets when it first opens. They expect you to draw you in with the many great selections and good food. Give it about a year later and the quality isn't as great as it once was. Since they know they're probably the buffet to beat, I don't think the service and quality of the food isn't on their mind anymore since they know people will come regardless. \n\nBesides the great selection of dessert which I don't really have much complaint about, it's their food that can be better. One example is their prime rib which used to be tender and juicy but it has been dry as of late. However, though quality has changed a bit from before, their huge selection and taste of some other food are just or even better than other buffets I've been to. You still have food you can't find anywhere else and their seafood selection is one of the best. I don't usually do the 24 hour AYCE pass whenever I go to Vegas because one buffet for a weekend stay is enough for me and I would probably choose this buffet or the Wynn Buffet everytime I go to Vegas until something better comes along. \n\nOne thing that annoyed me was the server. From the time we sat which was about 30 mins in, there was no waitress/waiter to serve us. It ended up being the busboy helping us get our drinks and clearing our table. You can tell by the 2nd time we started asking for refills he was kind of annoyed because he knew that wasn't his duty. The server finally showed up 45 mins later but there was no point. All she did was come to clean out the dishes from our table. You'd expect better service when you're paying $50+ for a buffet."

S'I loved this place the first time I came, the food was great it was relaxing and even though it was crowded you didn\'t have lines for food more then a minute or so.\n\nI went this weekend and given it was a holiday but some of their practices just sucked!  I waited in line for 2 hours to see a sign at the registers saying "Due to the Holiday limit your dining time to 2 hours" okay 2 hours is alot but our plan was to sit relax enjoy dinner and talk.  That was really irritating.  If they want to push more people out of there so they can make more money then charge a discount for limiting our time!\n\nThen the "platinum / diamond" members line was just ridiculous.  I know these people spend lots of money but it wasn\'t like Disneyland where they let 1 go from the normal line and 3 from the fast line.  It was they ALL get to go 1st.  So we would see people walk up and be seated within 5 minutes whereas everyone else was waiting 2 hours or more.  And it wasn\'t a few people there were tons of platinum members.\n\nOverall if there is more than a 10 minute line I will not return to this place.'

S'Bacchanal is definitely worthy of the title: "Best Buffet On The Strip"\nI\'ve tried all the top buffets on the strip(Wynn, Bellagio, The M) but Bacchanal tops them all in every category.\nI notice the majority of low ratings come from the dinner reviews.. this review is based on breakfast and lunch.\n\nFood: I love the breakfast here.. they cover all the traditional breakfast food but with different flares. Things like Chicken&Waffles, Skirt Steak & Eggs, Corned Beef  Hash with a fried Quail Egg, & Lobster Egg Benedict. They also have a good amount of their lunch menu out during breakfast including the meat section, featuring about a dozen or so cuts/meat.. I especially enjoy the prime rib, habanero sausage, and bacon-wrapped lamb. The Asian food section in the back is also open in the morning.. foods like shumai, Pad Thai, sushi, and the Asian soup station(Pho, Ramen, Udon), which are actually pretty decent.\n\nThis buffet has so much to offer.. from the 7 or 8 times we\'ve visited, they\'ve continued to come out with new, impressive options.\nSome of my other highlights: Chilean seabass, broccoli casserole, fried fish, any of the dishes that are topped with a fried egg, Baklava gelato, the salted caramel brownie thing, and the Horchata! \n\nAmbiance: A very clean, modern look with a comfortable setting that gives you a relaxing experience when enjoying your food. The main seating area could be a bit of a maze when going back and fourth but the overall layout is great. The one thing that does bother me is how wide the party-of-2 tables are and how close the tables are to one another. I was literally right next to the lady at the table next to me and further away from my girlfriend sitting across from me. I felt like I had to talk extra loud for my girlfriend to hear me, but soft enough so the next table isn\'t involuntarily listening to me.\n\nService: Yes, this is a very popular buffet but they\'ve come up with the genius idea of having a kiosk system where they text you when your table is almost ready. It is a very attractive idea because you don\'t get that discouraging feeling of seeing that crazy long line. It also gives you the opportunity to go do other things while waiting(gamble) :). All the staff members are very welcoming and polite.. quick servers and helpful cooks. The price of this buffet is a little bit more than all the others, but you will definitely get your money\'s worth every time. \n\nTips: If you\'re coming for breakfast, try to come at the end of the breakfast time(10-10:30ish) so you can get a taste of the lunch items that come out at 11am. Take your time, try to get in all the options they offer and enjoy. Don\'t forget your Total Rewards card for a small discount!'

S"Holy crap on a cracker!  The line to get into this posh buffet during dinner hours is major.\n\n1 hour to pay...\n1 hour to get seated...\n10-15 minutes to get seafood...\n\nBut the upside is, the food was pretty darn good.  When I hit a buffet, I always try to squish in 'AT LEAST' 3 rounds of servings.\n\nRound 1 - zero waiting:\nPork fried rice, chow mein, veggie spring roll, pork sui mai, Shanghai dumpling (YES, juice inside too), cali roll, salmon nigiri, beef with broccoli, kung pao chicken.\n\nI drank diet Coke for burp-age power, its to make more room for food after burping out the air in my stomach.\n\nRound 2 - 10 to15 minutes wait:\nBaked salmon, lobster bisque, seafood ceviche, lots of Alaskan king crab legs, lots and lots of shrimp cocktails, 4 freshly cracked opened oysters (this took the additional 5 minute wait)\n\nBreak time!  Drank diet coke for burp-age.\n\nRound 3 - 5 minutes wait:\nWagu beef slider, prime rib, bbq ribs, garlic mash potatoes, french fries in it's own fryer basket\n\nAt this point, I'm full up to my neck.  And almost can't walk anymore... but dessert must be eaten too.  At this point, I ordered a cup of hot tea to go with my dessert.\n\nRound 4 - zero waiting:\nDark chocolate layered mousse cake, lemon strawberry cupcake, creme brulee, chocolate dipped strawberries\n\nWhen I got back, my tea was waiting for me.  It was a nice touch for them to provide the hot water in it's own decanter but the tea was basic Lipton.  Yuck.  For $49.99, they should at least have better tea available!  \n\nI got my money's worth...definitely did.  I seen others shove more food into their mouths than I did but to each it's own :)\n\nTip:  Make sure to tip your waiter/waitress directly, they provide better service when you do this.  I took 1 star off due to all the waiting.  Otherwise, the food is 5 stars to me."

S"Currently the best buffet in LV. I love how they give you the option of hot or cold crab legs (if hot-they are prepared for you right then and there). There is a wide selection of food ranging from ramen (the broth was actually quite good) to wagyu sliders (overcooked). I do appreciate that everything is portioned out for you so that food doesn't go to waste. \n\nTry coming at off hours to avoid waiting for hours. The first time I came to Bacchanal the wait time was 3-4 hours. Hell no. I came back the next day and only waited around 40 minutes."

S"First of all the excitement, it is going to be a long wait first. I went first night at 6:30pm, which was a massively wrong decision. Gave up after 1.5 hours of wait without getting close to the gate. Next time we went 2:30pm, still had to wait almost 3 hours and be seated around 5:30pm. So if you are going, be prepared, and that's why it has one star off.\n\nAfter the leg soaring wait, the real excitement comes. The place look fancy AND the food is good. Food selection is awesome. Seafood, Mexican, Chinese, Sushi, Italian, ..... you name it, its most likely there.\n\nHighly recommend the mean section, they have great quality mean with huge selection. Also don't miss the dessert bar, they have macron, super tasty creme brulee and more. Just eating the dessert will get your money back. Worth the money, and Worth the wait.\n\nIf you want to get in quicker, stay at their hotel to get in quicker. Or pay extra $20 for VIP. Just my 2 cents."

Don't waste your time on other places because this place will give you quality food with abundance of choices.\n\nThat being said, this is the second year visiting this place. The first year was OUTSTANDING but this second year it was still up there but not the same. The quality is dropping a bit...\n\nThe mini burgers are my favorite. The salad bar is awesome....\n\nI think my favorite thing this year was the chocolate filled peanut butter cookies. OMG!!! Don't tell anyone but I snuck an extra cookie with me.\n\nMy hunny can eat and we stayed here for almost 3 hours. He went straight for the cuts of meat while I took my time enjoying the different soups, variety of salads, different ethnic dishes and finally dessert.\n\nI can't wait til next years visit to Vegas to see how the quality is after the third year!"

S'Negative 5 stars!\n\nMy family and I got in line around 3ish pm on Thanksgiving day.  There was a long line already and they told us the wait would be around 3 to 3.5hr.  That\'s not great but was expected (that\'s why we got in line early).  We figured we could still get in before 7.  Apparently the employees there MISCALCULATED the wait time!!!!\n\nThe line was moving along until around 5ish.  That\'s when they allowed the "express" ppl to cut in line.  Caesar Palace wanted to make extra bucks so they created an "express" line.  $20 per person in addition to the $50 price they already raised on Thanksgiving day.  We would\'ve left if we knew the wait was this long.  But by the 2nd and 3rd hour, we thought we were almost there when we were pretty close to the cashier.  But that\'s where the real wait began.  We waited and waited and waited and we were not going to leave the line after the 3rd hour of waiting.  And it would sound ridiculous if we paid extra to get into the express line after waiting for that long.\n\nWhen I told one of the hostesses we waited SIX HOURS, she was shocked.  She said, she\'s been telling all her guests the wait was only 3 to 4 hours.  Couldn\'t the employee be more diligent and not made up a wait time?!?!?  And after 6 hours of waiting, they told us we would have to wait even MORE if we decided to sit together.  So we ended up splitting our party into two tables.  Yeap, after a 6-hour wait, my family was seated separately on Thanksgiving day.\n\nWith the long wait, I expected great food and service... Another big disappointment.\n\nFood: What happened to the macaroons they always advertised?  There were no crab claws.  The cocktail shrimps were soggy.  Even the sushi was gross.  We saw the sushi "chef" took pre-made sushi out from saran wrap.  That showed you how fresh the sushi was.  Everything was mediocre.  Definitely not worth $50 and the long wait.\n\nService: Not great.  One of the chairs was soaking wet (caused by previous customer?) when we got to our table.  Our waiter simply put a towel on top and told us to just sit on it.  Really?!??!?!  It would have soaked right thru the towel and to my jeans because the chair was so wet.  I had to switch out the chair myself because the waiter didn\'t even stay for more than a sec.  And he basically disappeared that night too....\n\nIn conclusion... never coming back to this place again!'

S"BEST  BUFFET I BEEN TO IN VEGAS! \n\nI came around 11:15 AM and it was $35 per person. I guess for dinner it's $50. They had lots of food and endless amounts of meat, steak, BBQ. One side had Asian food, another side had Mexican, another side had American, another had Seafood, and guess what?! They didnt forget about the Vegetarian population! Yes they had a Vegetarian section!!!! Most buffets dont have that! Their desserts section was on the opposite side of the buffet but the sweet confections were to die for! Macaroons, gelato, cookies, and much much more! They had crab but a worker told me it didnt come in until 3:00 PM, which was a big bummer but i resorted to a bucket of mussels lol. The ramen and pho were pretty good and the sushi was great! They even had Horchata (mexican rice and cinammon drink) as well as Tamarindo, Pineapple juice, and other drinks from Mexico. Their tacos were also mad on a flat grill like at the taquerias back home in California. \n\nAlso, the workers were friendly and very attentive! They took care of me and my table of friends and made sure we were catered to! Now thats the 10 star service that i expected from this place!\n\nNot to mention its located in the beautiful Caesar Palace Hotel and Casino! Lines may get pretty long which is a big bummer but the food is well worth the wait!! Not to mention, they also take a picture of you and your group before being escorted to your table!\n\nIf your a gelato or macaroon or seafood fan, this is the place to dine at in Vegas!!"

The line was always flowing, and there's a person standing right there behind the counter, constantly refilling so there's never a lack. He was my hero.\n\nThe Chinese food section was surprisingly tasty, although I merely tasted a few selections. I was focusing my night on seafood and meats, but I enjoyed most of everything I grabbed.\n\nThe only disappointments were the wait to get in - over an hour (yes, it was soooo long), the table next to us got way more drink service and attention than we did, and although the desserts are extremely pretty, nothing really stood out as having amazing flavor and as something I'd go back for a second time."

If you go Vegas without stopping by Bacchanal, then it is one of the big lost that you have.\n\nThe foods here are good and have more variety , especially the desserts. One of  my favorite dessert that you cannot find where else at the buffet is Macaroons. All you can eat Macaroons. \n\nMake your money worth while you are in Vegas'

S"Hands down the very best buffet ever.  We've been several times but this time i had the mussels which were so tender and perfectly cooked and sauced. The smoked salmon was great, the bacon crispy,  the steak tender, the veggies flavorful, the seafood and fruit actually fresh, the Chinese food really authentic!   So much food you can actually imagine you are at a Roman feast and you probably could stay and keep eating for 24 hours and not repeat a dish (if you got a new dish every 10 min). Wow, what decadence! My favorite was the little fried donuts (today they had it with bananas and syrup ) which i have never had so incredibly light crispy on the outside.  Unique dishes to please the jaded but with a healthy dose of your standard fare cooked well to please everyone else.  Those little silicone finger mitts they give you?  It is to reach for those hot small dishes."

S"Being the new hot buffet in town creates some congestion. We went during the holidays but really Vegas is a holiday everyday. Line wait was just over an hour at dinner time . We could have ponied up the the extra 20 for line passes but glad we didn't. Noticed a couple that did and they still waited 20 plus minutes. OK, on to the food. I will start with seafood area. The crab legs are meh, cold or hot, yet they are cut in half and smaller than what I'm used to. I always like cracking mine open and releasing the juices. Oysters were fresh. Meat station was the highlight of the trip. I know meat is hit or miss with so many factors. The beef brisket was incredible. Rib eye not so much. Macaroni boo ya. Ribs were decent with a dry rub. Sausage ok. Sushi major disappointment. Peking duck well done. I did not look the way of the greens or veggies, sorry doc. I did take a gander at the desserts and lets just say mmmmm. Hot fresh made crepe with berries and whipped cream. Yes and Thank you!  I recommend going the first year it's open after that I predict a falling off of quality. Enjoy Yaw!"

S'This is supposed to be the new benchmark in terms of buffets in Vegas.  The insane line to get in is artificially conjured by intentionally being inefficient with their table clean up and seating.  You\'ll see plenty of open tables during your 2-3 hours wait to sit down!  And hell that\'s genius on their part since they offer a cut in front of the line option for an additional 15 bucks!\n\nThe overall food quality is pretty good though i\'ll give them that but there is a crazy line to get all of the "good stuff" like crab legs and prime rib.  I mean i eventually  gave up and just ate the random stuff that didn\'t have a line.    I could have easily eaten 2-3x as much raw oysters and crabs legs if the line wasn\'t so insane.  Another genius move on their part to move these lines a long so slowly.\n\nI mean if you are one of those people that love buffets then definitely check this place out but personally I think you are much better off at one of the many great restaurants in vegas.'

Grace greeted us with a warm hello and rung us up for $75 dinner. Our hostess lead us to our table and within 30 seconds, Alvaro came to get our drink order. I like to stick with water as anything else just adds to making me full even faster. \n\nAlvaro suggested we start with the seafood as it wouldn't fill us up so quickly. The selections included King crab legs, stone crabs, mussels, oysters and shrimp cocktail. They had tapas of shrimp and grits which were quite delish!\n\nAs the day went on, I found myself getting up 6 other times which I didn't mind at all. After all, I will go above and beyond for my favorite activity, eating.\n\nI can't wait to go back for Brunch as they serve Chinese donuts! I just have to give myself some time before having that much to eat again. I suggest if you do plan to go for dinner, go before 4:30 to beat the huge dinner crowd. I for one am not patient enough to wait in 2 hour lines, now matter how good the food may be."

S'Since opening 2-3 years ago, Bacchanal Buffet inside Caesars Palace has become the premier buffet location in Las Vegas, and it is definitely my first choice!!\n\nI am pretty sure Bacchanal Buffet has won "Best Buffet in Las Vegas" each of the past 2-3 years, and it is for good reason. Caesars spent over $17 million renovating and decorating the space for Bacchanal, and it looks absolutely gorgeous inside. The presentation is spot-on, and even the tables, chairs, and surrounding decorations are very impressive. But who goes to a buffet to see nice chairs? Not many people, so let\'s talk about the food.\n\nFirst of all, I recommend going for dinner, but come early, because the line can get pretty gnarly. Even though it\'s $54.99 per person, it is well worth it! There are a few key items that you MUST get: 1) Alaskan king crab legs (and get them steamed), 2) freshly shucked oysters, 3) peeled tiger shrimp, 4) ribeye lollipop, 5) lamb chops, 6) fresh-made tacos, and 7) chocolate-infused souflee. These 7 are the MUST try\'s if you are a first time visitor.\n\nThey also have a wide assortment of great Asian, Italian, Mexican, BBQ, and seafood dishes, and the largest dessert spread you will probably see in your entire life, unless you are royalty in a foreign country. The food is very well-prepared, and made extremely fresh. They are served in/on very modern dish ware, as well, adding to the impressive presentation.\n\nMy only complaints are the following:\n\n1) The line can be over 90 mins long, which is a little ridiculous for a buffet. I\'ve seen people leave just because of the line. It doesn\'t create the best experience, but it\'s tough to justify that wait when you can go elsewhere.\n\n2) The price is $54.99 for dinner, which is rather steep. This is a once-in-a-while splurging type of experience. It isn\'t an everyday "where do we go for dinner tonight?" type of place.\n\n3) The waiter/waitress service isn\'t that great. Each waiter/waitress takes care of so many tables, and it takes forever to get drinks and to get the tables cleared of old plates, etc.\n\nIn any case, we will be back to Bacchanal next time we are in Vegas. Super miss those crab legs, oysters, ribeye lollipop and lamb chops. This is no ordinary buffet - I guarantee you\'ll love it!'

S"I come to Vegas very often especially to try out the new restaurants since I am a true foodie and I heard so much hype about this place of course I had to try it. \n\nWhen I got there the lines was ridiculously long.  They said the wait was over 3 hours long.  I don't know if it's just me but I would never wait in line for 3 hours to eat anywhere.  Luckily my husband is a VIP card holder so we didn't have to wait in the long line which was definitely a plus.  Otherwise I would have left without trying this place.\n\nI have tried mostly all the buffets in Vegas so I had really high expectations for this place. For a buffet their decor is very impressive.  Maybe that's why their prices are a bit higher than most other buffets in Vegas.  \n\nThe food was pretty good and the dessert selection was great but I don't see anything that really stands out about this place except for the fact that you have to stand in line for hours for most people and that the price is more than most of the other buffets where you can get about the same quality of food for less in my opinion.  \n\nIf your a first timer in Vegas this place will most likely be impressive.

As you would expect a whole lot to choose from. Definitely eat the waygu bed sliders. Everything from the Asian section was awesome which to me says a lot about the quality. The had a to order taco bar. Shellfish bar. The BBQ section brought a tear to my eye. Sausages. Prime rib. Brisket that you would sell your soul for. The carver at the BBQ station was so nice too. He was smiling away chatting the entire two hours I was there. Wait. Did I just admit I was there for two hours? I swear I didn't eat the entire time. 90 minutes tops!

S"Dude, anyone who says that the quality of the food at Bacchanal does not match the steep price of entrance is a VERY confused and disturbed child. The quality and creativity of the foods available at this buffet completely puts other casino buffets to shame. Because every dish is made in small batches and constantly replaced, the quality and freshness is never compromised for any guest. \n\nTheir seafood station is an absolute dream for any true seafood lover. They have huge fresh oysters, incredible smoked trout, and a gazpacho with crab that's toe-curling good.\n\nThe gourmet and impressively fresh salad and vegetable selections won both my dining partner and I over. I highly suggest that you grab the chicken and waffles as well. I didn't eat the waffles as I only grabbed the dish because I was in the mood for fried chicken. The Bacchanal makes good fried chicken that didn't leave an oily residue on my finger tips at all! It was crisp, juicy, and everything I wanted out of fried chicken.\n\nAnd as other reviewers have raved, the dessert station is something you just need to see and experience for yourself. Stupendous, top notch selection! They have green tea cookies, chocolate cookies, espresso tarts, mousses, cheese cakes, cupcakes, cake pops, everything! Usually when I go to buffets I'm not one to gorge myself and I usually just stop eating when I'm comfortably full (I know, I'm unusual..) but the Caesar's Palace made me want to leave a little bit overstuffed and I feel great about it."

The carving stations was also great with a selection of ribeye, lamb chops,  and prime rib .You can tell they take care to ensure that each item is of quality. Now onto my favorite part, dessert! In my opinion, the desserts at wicked spoon at the cosmo were better, but don't get me wrong I still thought the ones here were good. Loved their creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e and macarons.

The OJ here was really good and tasted fresh and not like Tropicana or Florida's Natural.  For costing $17M dollars the placed looked nice.\n\nThe 30 day dry aged Tomahawk rib-eye was the best thing they had imo.  It was cooked perfectly every time, the crust on it was great and was juicy.  But it took me going up there 6 times to get 2 servings of it.\n\nThe quality at sushi station was not good at all and I had better sushi at Famima today.  Their fried chicken, the mussels, the clam bake, the halibut,salmon and mexican food were all overcooked and dry.  \n\nThere were many other things which I was disappointed with but that Rib eye is still in my mind."

S'Loved, loved, loved, loved, loved this eatery! I like to think of myself as a fine connoisseur of buffets and I had always heard good things about this place. But "good" was an understatement. This place was the Garden of Eden of buffets. I\'m not going into full detail, but I will tell you that I tried a sample from every station and did to complain once (with the sushi, burger, and dessert bar being my favorites). If it were physically and mentally possible, I would eat here for the rest of my life. With friendly staff, a super-clean environment, and more food (of superior quality, no less) than I\'ve seen in a fortnight, there is no doubt in my mind I will go to any other buffet while in Vegas.'

S"This is definitely the best buffet in Vegas, however the wait is extremely long. They have a great selection of carved meats, seafood, Italian food, Asian food and even 'sushi'. Their Sunday brunch buffet is great.  I highly recommend their gravlax/smoked salmon, any of their carved meats, the ceviche (absolutely amazing) and the crab legs. And the best thing about the Sunday brunch was unlimited mimosas (however, I only got two as our server did not check on us very often)."

You can get them chilled or hot! Which is an added bonus. And my oh my, the dessert selection is to die for! Killer desserts! Got to try the Aztec Chocolate gelato! \n\n\nPlus on Sunday, they have champagne brunch. So for $45/person, you can have unlimited champagne/mimosas until you burst!'

The dessert area was amazing as well so save room! Crepes and shave ice made to order!\n\nIt was about $77 for two, plus we tipped the staff that were fairly attentive in cleaning up our used plates.

As we were leaving (around 6), the line seemed twice as long as when we got there.\n\nAnyway, the food. Just about everything is good. Highlights for me were the lamb chops, tomahawk ribeye steak, king crab legs (that they'll heat if you ask and are pre-cut), and dessert. Salad bar seemed good too but I'm a carnivore."

S"If you're looking for a Vegas buffet, look no farther. The Bacchanal buffet has an amazing selection of foods from all different ethnic groups as well as a fantastic selection of desserts. Just make sure you have a few hours to kill so that you can eat your money's worth. You won't be disappointed.\n\nOur group arrived at 2pm on Saturday and waited about an hour before paying $48 to get in, which included bottomless mimosas. After we were seated, we had noticed that they were transitioning from brunch to dinner, so we quickly scrambled to grab some brunch foods. The Asian foods were all really tasty, especially the dim sum type foods, but the sushi was average and the different fried rices/stir frys were good but not great. Moving on to the proteins, the prime rib was cooked to perfection, the steak tacos were great, and the sliders... oh man those wagyu beef sliders are game changers. The seafood selection was pretty extensive and the oysters tasted fresh, however the cold king crab was subpar in both taste and texture. The crawfish were tasty and the andouille sausage mixed in added a great flavor.\n\nOnto dessert, the fresh made crepes, the huge selection of baked goods, fresh gelato and assorted sweets were a nice way to finish out the meal.\n\nThe servers were very attentive, constantly bussing our plates and refilling our glasses without needing much prompting."

I called earlier to confirm they have lobster and king crab before I went there. And they said they had lobster and king crab. That was the reason I chose Bacchanal. However, there was neither lobster nor king crab. I was disappointed a bit. \n\nHaving said that, food quality is excellent. Service is awesome.'

S'I really don\'t have too much to say about this buffet. I realize that it receives rave reviews and it\'s been featured in many "Top _____" lists of places to hit up in Vegas, but it simply didn\'t leave a lasting impression on me for whatever reason.\n\nMy husband and I decided to get in line a little after lunch time, around 3p.m. The line moved so incredibly slowly, I was soon getting pissy. My feet hurt, I was tired of staring at the folks next to me, and I was hungry! Rawrrrr!\n\nWe finally got to the front of the line after roughly 45 minutes of waiting. Once it was our turn to pay, all the cashiers left their stations and stood around chatting for about 10-15 minutes. By this time, I was expecting every dish to be made of gold and diamonds, based on the excruciatingly long wait time. \n\nFinally, the cashiers returned to the their stations and we paid and waited in another line to be seated. That line, luckily, didn\'t take as long to get through and we were seated right by the entrance of the place, about a foot away from an odd older German gentlemen and his younger \'not so interested\' male date. On our other side was an Asian couple who barely ate and just looked grumpy. It was a little too close for comfort for my hubby and I, as we enjoy moving our arms freely as we eat. \n\nAfter giving the waitress our drink orders, we got up to indulge, finally. I grabbed a plate and walked around the loooooooong seafood line to get to the other areas of the buffet. I really wasn\'t wowed by anything they had to offer. I had some sweet potato tot things (Hey Napoleon, give me some of your tots!), mashed potatoes, some type of chicken, and a sample of numerous desserts. \n\nAfter tasting the food I had waited so long for, and paid so much for (It was an Easter buffet or something at the time), I was really not blown away. I mean, it was good, it was a Vegas buffet, after all. In all honesty, I\'d much rather blow my money at the Wicked Spoon, which at least has a couple of dishes that I LOVE.\n\nAs far as ambiance - it was super duper crowded and uncomfortable. I felt like everyone was staring at me eat because they literally were staring at me while I ate. Not EVERYone, but the people nearing the front of the line who had been waiting their hour. A good 30 or so people had a good view of me stuffing my face. I know I shouldn\'t care, but I\'m the observant type, so it was off putting. I didn\'t like how closely I was sitting to our neighbors, and I didn\'t like being seated right in front of a line! There. I\'ve said it. \n\nMy hubby and I may try this buffet again on a future trip to Vegas to see if the first encounter was a fluke, but more than likely we\'ll stick with the Aria buffet, Wicked Spoon, or the Wynn buffet.'

S"I went back to the Bacchanal Buffet again today with my best friend, daughter, and brother. This was my second time coming here and eating at this buffet (first time was last year). I was a bit reluctant because I didn't have a good experience last time plus I was scared to just throw away another $50 in the trash. However, I'm really glad I took the risk to give them a second chance because I didn't leave disappointed. I did leave in pain because I stuffed my face to the point where I thought my stomach was just going to explode!\n\nAnyway, I have plenty of nice things to say about their food. It is definitely up to par! Everything that I had was absolutely delicious! \n\n- Salmon nigiri: Delicious! I only got three because the rice will fill you up really fast. \n\n- Chicken curry: It was pretty good, but my dad makes better curry.\n\n- Ratatouille: This was the first time I've tried this and it was so yummy! It's basically vegetables with pasta on top, but it was so delicious!\n\n- Carbonara: Pasta was great. It wasn't overcooked and it wasn't salty.\n\n- Chicken tacos: I had these with guacamole, onions, lime, & cilantro, and I LOOOOVE these tacos! You can really taste the freshness of the vegetables and the authenticity of the tacos. SO delicious! \n\n- Horchata, mango juice, and pineapple: Did I mention that they have a juice station in the Mexican food area?! It's not just ANY juice -- It's AGUAS FRESCAS! I got two horachata bottles, haha!\n\n- Truffle fries: fjadf;jasdlkjf OMG. These were just so freaking amazing. I seriously could eat these all day and could not get tired of it. It wasn't overly salty and the truffles give that beautiful taste to the fries. UGGHHH SO GOOD!\n\n- Crab legs: I love my crab legs cold AND with butter. Delicious and it was pretty meaty. I love that they're already cut in half for you so you don't have to pick it and fight it just to open and eat it.\n\n- Oysters: Yummy! I'm so glad that they have oysters. The seafood definitely makes the price you pay for worth it!\n\n- Oyster shooters: YUM! I would have more if I wasn't so willing to make room for dessert.\n\nDESSERT: THEY HAVE MACCARONS! ALL. YOU. CAN. EAT. !!!! This place just won my heart. \n\nSERVICE: They did A LOT better with their service this time. They took the plates off of the tables pretty fast. They refilled my drinks. They were just a lot more attentive than they were the first time I was here. HOWEVER, during the last 30 minutes we were there, we were kind of neglected. NO ONE informed us that our server already left and was done with her shift. We had to ask ourselves. That's the only reason why I deducted a star.\n\nI can't wait to come here again. Probably not anytime soon because I'm not a rich girl BUT I will be coming here more often!"

S"Definitely my new favorite buffet. I would give it 5 stars but I'm cheap and don't like the $50 price tag. But the food was excellent. Huge shrimp cocktail, warm king crab legs, great selection of Chinese and Thai food. The Mexican station had tacos which reminded me of the taco stands in Mexico. Althea American BBQ station had a lot to choose from. All tasting really good. Oh and they had sweet potato tater tots and Parmesan garlic fries which were fantastic. If you don't mind the $50 per person dinner price then try this place. It's awesome. Even though I'm cheap I will still be stopping by the next time I'm in town."

S'=The Facts= \n-December 7-9, 2012: "the off season", per our server.\n-Friday AND Saturday night 8pm: ~10 people in line, seated in 5 minutes.\n-Sunday just before noon: ~75 people in line, seated in under 30 minutes.\n\n-8pm offered dinner items. \nAt least 95% repeat items between Fri-Sat-Sun.\n-12pm offered 20% breakfast items / 80% dinner. \nI say dinner instead of lunch, because they were the same items that we saw at 8pm on our previous visits.\n\n95% of the food we tried was, for the lack of a better term, "restaurant quality", opposed to "cafeteria quality". The quality you would expect from your favorite local (insert ethnicity here) eatery that\'s been in business for 20 years, and not a chain, precooked and packaged after thought.\n\nThere\'s a battle being waged in Las Vegas, The Battle of the Buffets, and \nThe Bacchanal is currently winning. I love this trend. As long as the quality of food and price stay in line with each another, and I think they have for the most part, I will continue to look forward to the next contender. \nMeanwhile, The Bacchanal Buffet is the place to eat.\n\nPRO TIP!: If you have the constitution to pull off more than 2 visits in a 24hr span, you will likely benefit from the Buffet of Buffets 24hr Pass.

Looked good\n\n[American/Meats]- Hit or miss with some, Mac and cheese was light but creamy\n\n[Pizza] SO GOOD. SAUCE IS LITTLE SWEET.\n\n[Seafood] Heard crab legs were ok-good. I tried the salmon and that was delicious. Lobster corn chowder was nice but kinda salty.\n\n[Veggies/Fruit] Pretty small, less veggies but more fruit (fresh)\n\n[Dessert] Impressive: icecream, cookies, freshly made crepes\n\n ----------\n\nOverall: Filled me up, seemed like some items were lacking in something, worth the trip and experience.'

S'So my two buddies came up with the bright idea of paying credit card roulette. At the Caesar\'s Buffet no less. Reluctantly I threw my AmEX into the pot. And guess what? My friggin card gets pulled. I was like whatever man. We put our names in the res system and it was a 90 min wait......at 3pm!! Wtf! So we go to the casino to gamble, which of course is what they want you to do.\n\nFast forward about 100 min and our names are finally paged. So I go and pay...$200! For 3 of us....oh man I say. I\'m gonna milk this for what its worth. We sit down about 430pm. And this is after a night of clubbing and boozing so don\'t mind us as we lethargically make our way to the table. \n\nWe all scope out the spread and we were awestruck. Never in my life have I seen a spread like this. Anything and everything. They have it. My strategy at buffets is to sample a little of everything. But really on this day, and with this size, I just couldn\'t do it. I couldn\'t. I grabbed some japanese food and soup for a "starter", then some crab and shrimp. Then on to the heavier stuff like ribs sausage and other bbq. By this time I was stuffed! But alas, I have a sweet tooth so I had to do dessert. This is where Bacchanal shines, IMO. They got everything here. Macroons, gelato, cakes, cookies, fruit....aww yeah! \n\nGood value? An unequivocal no! But it is a must try. And you are in Vegas. So just do it. You won\'t regret it. Until the next morning. Oh and we sat there like the fat a$$es that we were from 430 to almost 9pm! And our hostess, which I won\'t name because we don\'t want to get her in trouble, was so awesome. And cute! She let us stay and just engorge ourselves.'

S'You know when you get all amped up to go to one of the all you can eat lobster feasts in Orlando and when you are done wonder why I wasted $50 on a so-so buffet?  With my first (and probably last) visit to the Bacchanal, I am thinking the same.  While the food was actually quite good, it definitely wasn\'t worth the $50.  Not much selection, "hot" crab legs were lukewarm, two full stations with Asian offerings limiting variety of rest of buffet, dessert bar smaller than most other buffets I have experienced, and the traffic flow was confusing.  I have experienced better in other Midwest and southern casinos.  If this is the best Las Vegas has to offer, the reviewers must not travel extensively.  It was ok but I would not go out of my way to eat there again.  Noticed that not much of a line and no wait at 5:30.'

Didn't think you can make something so simple like scrambled eggs so tasty!! For breakfast they have a variety of egg dishes, hash browns, tator tots, breads, pancakes, omelets, chicken and waffles and freshly squeezed juice blends. They even have dim sum!

It's also one of the more pricey hotel/casino buffets.  A friend and I went around 7-8PM on a weeknight, and thankfully the line wasn't more than 15 minutes.\n\nThe selection felt like a normal buffet selection: seafood station, carving station, asian station with ramen & pho, pasta, cheese & charcuterie bar, etc. etc.  They did have a neat little area where they were making honey.  That contraption was cool looking.  \n\nThe only things I remember really sticking out were the taco station and dessert.  There were 3 different types of tacos available and a cook making them to order.  They were delicious and I actually broke unspoken buffet code and went back for seconds. :p For dessert, they have a crepe station where you can douse your crepe in toppings and drizzles galore.  I ended up with nutella with a side of crepe and fresh fruit. :) \n\nAll in all, it was a pretty forgettable experience and definitely overrated.  I'd much rather spend the money at Wicked Spoon."

After waiting for an hour and knowing it would be another hour wait (plus we had a show to go to) we decided to pay the extra $20 bucks per person and just get inside!\n\nOh wow, so much amazing food! I had mainly thanksgiving food since on Thanksgiving day we ate at an Italian place in Ceasars, which was very good actually. Let's see there was turkey, sausage, prime rib, candied yams, glazed carrots,  green beans, mashed potatoes, and more! It was all delicious. My boyfriend also had some of the thanksgiving fare as well as some sliders, pizza and he really enjoyed the brisket.\n\nI was most excited about the freshly steamed crab legs! Yep...I will admit I had two plates. They were delicious! You bring them a clean plate and they will hand you back your plate full of piping hot crab legs! They had little cups of melted butter just off to the side. I also grabbed some lemon wedges and squeezed the lemon on the crab meat before dipping into the butter. Omg heaven!\n\nFor desserts I believe I tried their tiramisu, creme brulle, and a chocolate mousse. My boyfriend had a raspberry dessert, a piece of tropical cake and I believe something chocolate...he always gets something chocolate.

The chorizo ( at least i think it was chorizo) tastes like what armpits smells like, hence "armpit clams". The layout was rather strange since all the seafood were next to each other in one section so the line for that was long and insane ( plus you have the crazy asian ladies jumping in and out because they think they are special and for them to have to stand in line like the rest of us is absurd- i want to trip them).\nThe prime rib was overcooked, even when i asked for the rarest piece. \nOysters were pretty decent although it had quite a bit of shell fragments, but i know these gluttonous folks had those shuckers madly working away.\nThe shrimp cocktail were huge but don\'t let that fool you. They were tasteless.\nOh yeah, not macarons. What the heck. Had they had that I would have upped my review to three stars.\n\nthe good:\nlines to get in where long and confusing and at first we didn\'t realize it was only a line leading towards the kiosk. so you use the kiosk to put down your reservation and it\'ll print out what time you should return to check in. that way you are free to do anything else rather than stand in line for 3 hours.I"m not sure if they only have that when it\'s a holiday and crazy crowded because from what i heard they didn\'t do it via that system before.'

S"Came here to eat with 10 other girls around 2:30pm-3pm on a Saturday, which was a good time to come since it was AFTER the lunch rush. We only waited in line for about 10 minutes =). It was about $53 per person with tax and an 18% gratuity charge since we had such a large group. \n\nThis is an awesome new buffet and the architectural construction, decor, furnishings, and interior design is stunning. The beautifully bright, modernized atmosphere greatly enhanced my dining experience here with friends! You'll enjoy the simple, yet artistic displays of food. Every section with categories and subsets of certain types of food are so well organized! There's a seafood section, a tacos taqueria section, a cheese section, salad section, soup and bread section, dessert section, a meat section (prime rib, baby back ribs, & etc.), an Italian food section, a Spanish food section, an American food section, and an Asian foods section with Vietnamese, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, and Korean dishes. I tried some of the dim sum and was really impressed with their xiao long baos (Shanghai juicy pork soup dumplings) and Shumais (These Cantonese style steamed dumplings). To conclude, you'll love the WIDE varieties of different types of cuisine that Bacchanal Buffet has to offer! \n\nI ate mostly seafood because I'm a HUGE seafood fan. Shrimp and grits, poached salmon, king crab legs, mussels, shrimp cocktail, oysters, oyster shooters, clam bake, sashimi/sushi, you name it, I had it, and I LOVED it. I also tried the prime rib and baby back ribs which I loved as well. Pretty much everything I ate was desirably delicious.\n\nService was excellent which made our experience here even more worthwhile. Our waitress kept making rounds to our table to pick up used plates, cups, and she consistently refilled our drinks! We had a table of 11 rather demanding, but sweet girls, and our waitress worked it LIKE A BOSS.\n\nI've been to plenty of buffets in Vegas and as of now, Bacchanal ranks the highest above all others in my book."

S"You have to take my review with a grain of salt as I did not have to wait a single minute to get in. \n\nThe buffet is very pricey.  Three people, it was $200.00.  Yes, it's expensive but when you walk out, just don't slide in that $20.00 you were going to in the slot machine.  There, you've saved money so you can eat.\n\nThe food here is amazing.  Really, nothing tasted like buffet food.  Everything was fresh and excellently made.  I hate reading too much so here's the list of items to get.  \n\nChinese Line (on the far right)\n\nDon't go there.  Are you stupid?  Why would you pay $60.00 for buffet Chinese food.  You are probably the type of person that eats at PF Changs (aka expensive Panda Express)  Move along to the left.\n\nMexican Line (next to the Chinese)\n\nRead the above.  If you are paying $60.00 for buffet Mexican, take your ass back to Old Country Buffet.\n\nMeats\n\nOk.  The Prime Rib was AMAZING.  I have to say it was better than Bellagio and that is really saying something.  Make sure to get at least two slices.  \n\nSushi - The best quality of sushi at any buffet.  Everyone talks about how good this is.  Every piece was very good, fresh and high quality.\nOthers\n\nWings - awesome and perfect amount of spiciness.  The chicken is high quality and there's plenty of meat.  Only get a couple pieces though because there's too much else to try.\n\nPho - yeah.  I said Pho.  This is definitely the best pho I have ever had made by a white guy in a chef's hat.  You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try this.\n\nDessert - get the mochi icecream.  Don't forget it.  This item is crucial because mochi can be hard, stale or too melted.  This was just right and absolutely perfect.  They only give you two at a time so be ready for that.\n\nCoffee - they give you your own little pot.  This is a small touch that I love because I hate having to track down someone for a warm up - especially in the chaos of a buffet.  \n\nDO NOT MISS THIS PLACE IN YOUR TRIP.  IT IS VERY WORTH IT.  AND YES IT IS BETTER THAN BELLAGIO."

S'Man, I feel bad that I didn\'t really enjoy this place that much. It kinda makes me feel like a contrarian but it\'s my honest opinion.\n\nThis new buffet is supposed to rival all the other high-end buffets in town such as Bellagio, Wynn, and the M. Although it is definitely not your average buffet, I don\'t think it\'s as good as any of the above mentioned ones on their worst days. This buffet didn\'t have that "wow" factor I was expecting, especially after having that when I first ate at each of those previously mentioned.\n\nIt was not all bad but I would like to point the things that determined my 3.5 rating:\n\nKing crab legs were still frozen. Not sure if some of the pieces had been sitting on the ice for too long or if they came out that way. Stone crab legs were dry and bland. Oysters were not that fresh even though I observed some guys shucking them behind the line :-/ Some of the labels were missing and or wrong for the food items and that\'s just a pet peeve of mine. Sushi and Chinese stations had your usual suspects, nothing that really stood out.\n\nOkay enough of the bad, let\'s talk about the good/must haves:\n\nCheddar broccoli in the American section was the best type of broccoli I have ever had. It was kinda crunchy from being baked, with gooey, greasy cheddar cheese melted on them. Wow. Italian meatballs were perfectly flavored. Sop up the extra marinara with a garlic knot. Prime rib was good, had the nice peppered crust on the outside that I just love. Lamb chops were good, no mint jelly needed. Not gamey at all. Mexican station had this awesome grilled pineapple and jicama salad. Chinese station had a peppered beef with asparagus and dim sum that were pretty good. There was a pho/ramen station that I didn\'t get to try but I thought it was cool that they offered that. Nutella crepe made to order was yummy and the buttered caramel gelato has to be my new favorite flavor. So rich and buttery, you need to have a drink handy. That sweetness will sit in the back of your throat and tickle if you don\'t wash it down.\n\nOkay, so that was my review. I think everybody should still go check this place out and I hope you all have a wonderful experience if you do. I think I was expecting too much because of my past experiences. Not to mention all the hype about this.'

S'Buffets are tough! keeping food under a lamp and maintaining freshness is not easy. I don\'t often do buffets for this reason. But in Vegas supposedly you have too! I read an article in USA today saying that Caesar\'s had arguably the best buffet in Vegas. We actually signed up for the "Buffet of Buffets" deal where you pay $55-$70 depending on the buffets you choose. We paid the extra $25 to add Caesar\'s dinner. So worth it! This buffet was endless and phenomenal. I literally tried nothing that I didn\'t enjoy. If I had to give advise I would say pass on the Buffet of Buffets deal because buffets for 24 hours is tough especially in Vegas. But Caesars buffet I would visit again in a heart beat!'

Everything tasted fresh and it was gourmet, there mashed potatoes weren't boxed they're dessert selection was phenomenal. You could eat all the cookies, cakes, and gelato your heart desired.

S'Probably the best buffet in memory. It might be better than the one I had at the Bellagio.\n\nThe presentation is way beyond what one would normally expect at a buffet. Seemingly meticulously presented shot glasses of soup and gazpacho, little cups and cones of desserts, pleasingly plated netted baskets of waffle fries and fried chicken, the individual portions of lobster bisque and Cajun steamed crawfish, and the single serve bottles of freshly squeezed orange juice (nothing like it!).\n\nAnd it goes beyond mere presentation. They taste as good as they looked, maybe even better at times. The shot glass of ceviche is probably one of the best I\'ve had, if not *the* best. The desserts were fantastic; I\'d highly recommend the sugar-free cheesecake and the sugar-free creme brulee. The understated flavours of these two desserts were outright home-runs, touch downs, three-pointers, sixer, goal, or whatever sports-related superlative you might want to use to describe it.\n\nThe day\'s chef\'s special dish of, what I guess, Halibut with shavings of coconut was indeed special! The dim sums were good, and the sushi, passable. I guess no matter what you try, it\'s just not possible for left-out-in-the-open sushi to compare with made-to-order sushi. But keeping that in mind, the sushi didn\'t disappoint much.\n\nIt\'s funny how the spread is spread out around the corner. When you take a few steps to "that faraway table", you realise there\'s more just around the corner. And this repeated about three times for me. It was like going down a rabbit-hole --- albeit a very pleasant one. :-)\n\nAt $38 (inclusive of tax), it\'s more than bang-for-the-buck.'

S'This buffet was the one of two buffets I had on my must go to list while I visited Vegas (other being Wicked Spoon). We ended up going around 1pm which made the price for each person $35.99.  The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The waitress called me by name (since I paid) for the entire meal and even asked my friend her name.\n\nThere are seven different sections including seafood, sushi, breads, cheeses, tacos, meats and even fresh juices. They also have a separate bar for desserts including gelato. The food was delicious. The standout for me was the sweet potato tots. The desserts were so amazing and were my favorite part as I am a sugar lover. I would recommend this buffet, especially if you can make an earlier time so it will be the lowest cost. The price was the only downfall for me, besides the bathroom being up the entrance making you walk all the way out of the buffet to use it.'

We come back only to see that we have to wait in another line for another hour and a half. Unbelievable! I've eaten here before and the food is good, but not worth waiting 3-4 hours. So many people had to be turned away. The old fashioned system of waiting in line is still better than this tocket system. Not sure if I will come here again on a weekend."

S"Bacchanal you have let me down! \n\nThe one star is for downgrading food and the bad service from this head of the host guy.    \n\nWe have been here since March 2013 and the food has downgraded a major major level!!! There used to be Asian chicken soup, awesome soup station and tomahawk  ribeye to name a few of my favorites.  They stop serving any of the above and what's even better it's $60 pp for dinner!!\n\nNow, the service; The look-like-manager, head of host STEVEN KUO is an a$$hole.  We were here with a party of 8 and wanted to put together 2 tables right next to each other where MR.KUO claims it's too small even though we say we don't mind.  He insist saying that you'd have to wait another 30 minutes if we would like a table together. If we had to split into 2 tables why do we have to pay 18% gratuity? WHY if we are sitting at two separate tables and have to pay 18% tip? MR manager STEVEN KUO please Fix your attitude and retake customer service 101!!!!!!!!!!!!"

S"Tips to make your experience here enjoyable:\n\n- You can pay $15 extra to get in the express line and avoid a 2 hour wait to get in, but on a busy day the wait can still be very long.\n\n- The most important tip if you like crab legs. They have cold and HOT crab legs. If you want them hot go to the Italian station at the other end of the buffet where you see some cooks making pizza. Ask the guy next to the big pots.\n\n- The line for the taco bar is very long so it's best to get a couple or don't plan on coming back.\n\n- Make sure you don't get an end piece of prime rib. They are overcooked and dry. Ask for a middle piece that's pink.\n\n- Avoid the pad thai, mac and cheese, macaroons, tofu cake pops, and churros.\n\nOverall there are a lot of options and I find myself choosing this place over Wicked Spoon. The seafood is top quality. Of all things I enjoyed their dim sum. They have great cookies and flan, but I found most of the desserts underwhelming. A top 5 buffet in my book."

S'My husband and I ate here the day after our wedding. We couldn\'t decide together on where we wanted to go, but I really wanted to try this buffet after hearing a lot of great things about it. We came for lunch on Memorial Day Weekend nonetheless. The line was not that bad. I would say we waited about five to seven minutes to be seated. The decor in this place was typical to a Strip buffet: very sleek and modern. The price was a little up there. I even used my Total Rewards card, but I only got a discount of a couple of dollars. For a lunch buffet, I think we received a great value. There was a wide variety of food: wider than I expected. I liked that the food was served in small portions because then you can get a small taste of everything and get your money\'s worth. The presentation of the food was upscale. Everything I ate was delicious. The fresh-squeezed juice was my favorite. I\'ve never seen a "juice bar" of sorts in any buffet that I have eaten at in Las Vegas. The only complaint I have is that the staff wasn\'t as attentive as I would have liked them to be, especially considering it wasn\'t very busy while we were there. I go through drinks fast and it seemed like forever for one of the staff to refill my drink. My husband was impressed though. I think we will come here again, but only on a special occasion.'

S"The most expensive buffet I've ever been to -- and also the best, by far!\n\nThere are so many options to choose from, whatever you like, you have a good chance of finding it here. The Asian foods were what I enjoyed the most, but there is clearly something for everyone . The Peking Duck is awesome and it's tied with the Wagyu sliders as my favs here. I would pay a lot just to get those two dishes!\n\nThe smoked salmon is first rate, as is the prime rib, brisket, char-shu pork, spare ribs, bao, pad thai, and chow fun. I was so full I didn't even get to try the sushi which looked good too.\n\nGreat dessert bar, I managed to put away some excellent gelato and finished with a pot of Italian roast coffee that was (surprisingly) savory.\n\nI can not recommend this buffet strongly enough. If price is an issue, go at lunch when it's a bit less. Still pricey, but not a ton more than you'd pay at many other mid-range restaurants. You have to get your own food, but that's a small price to pay. And you get to choose what you want and how much you want. \n\nI can't wait to go back!"

S"Hands down the best buffet I've been to in Vegas. \n\nThis place seemed to have everything! The seafood bar and the dessert station definitely stood out. \n\nMake sure your come with an empty stomach because you'll need to be rolled out like a barrel when you're finished. \n\nStart off slow with non-carb items (seafood bar was my first stop for Oysters, Oyster Shooters, Shrimp, Crab). \n\nMake your way over to a few pieces of sushi, BBQ rib tips and some shrimp dumplings. Take a little break and contemplate some veggies - the Bacchanal Buffet has a good selection of veggies and salads. \n\nOnce you're done with the light stuff, prepare for fried dishes (this is where your stomach will start to feel the pain). Load up on more dumplings, egg rolls, noodles, pizza or whatever else you fancy - just be sure to only fill yourself to 100% capacity. \n\nAt this point you may want to chill at your table and let the food settle. Enjoy some drinks and check to see if anyone has commented on your previously shared photos. You'll feel as there's no way you're going back again, but this is just your stomach battling your mind, don't let it win!\n\nBefore checking out the dessert island (it's huge), you may want to do another round on the seafood bar. Oyster shooters will settle your stomach really nicely in preparation for dessert. Have a couple of those and curse the gods for not giving you a greater stomach capacity. Also, many use this time to take a potty break! You can go out of the buffet and come back in to do this - no questions asked. \n\nNow, for the grand finale you will show your friends the true power of mind over matter! Grab a fresh plate and wobble over to the crepe station. Don't be fooled by mini desserts and gelato in your path! Order a crepe of your preference - they will look like heaven on your plate. To complete the color spectrum, add a few strawberries or other assorted fruit on your plate. This will also make for a nice photo op. Struggle back to your table and unleash your inner photographer! Some may choose to order a cup of coffee to enjoy with their crepe - but to each his own. \n\nAt this point you should be bursting at the seams but we're not quit done. Suck your gut in as much as possible so that you don't look like a hippo and walk slowly over to the mini desserts and gelato area. Grab as many as you like. I recommend the creme brulee, macaroons, pistachio gelato and chocolate mousse. With a second cup of coffee, painfully ingest as much as you can, and try to remember the flavors as the feeling of joy won't last too long now. \n\nWhen all is finished you will feel like the biggest pig in the world and will avoid eye contact with anyone you came with. Not to worry, a few hours of walking will wear off any feelings of shame. You'll even start walking normally without having to suck your gut in to not look like a pregnant woman (gender indifferent)."

S'My wife and I went there for the first and last time today. Beautiful decor and the food presentation was terrific but ... There was one "hot" food item we tried that was more than luke warm. Hot food should be kept around 135 degrees or hotter. Really tasty chowder - luke warm; fried chicken with sweet potato fries - luke warm chicken and cold fries; brisket - luke warm. Having suffered from food poisoning a little over a month ago at my own hand I was reluctant to finish anything that isn\'t at the proper temperature. We told a "manager" who acted concerned and said she\'d tell the chef. Tell the chef? How about serving food at a proper and safe temperature. The scary thing? They had an "A" rating from the LV Health Inspection. Maybe I need to start carrying around my own thermometer when I go out from now on. Disgusting. This place was cheap and I expected better.'

S"So I was in vegas last weekend and I asked my friends what was the best buffet in vegas since I haven't been in vegas for over 6 years now.  Bacchanal came up a number of times so I decided to check it out.  We went at 6:30pm on a sunday and it wasn't that busy, we got seated within 10 minutes.  One of the things that I like about this buffet is that they serve hot crab legs.  You just have to go over to the Italian food station instead of the seafood station.  My suggestion for anyone coming here is to first go around and look at all the different options, and then decide what you want to try, don't try to over do it in the first pass, its not a race but a marathon.  Overall I felt that the quality of the different food was good but not sure if you really get your moneys worth at the $55 price tag.  You may be better off just eating in a nice restaurant but if you want variety then this is the place to go."

S"Our favorite buffet in Vegas. Always a wait but they do have those handy dandy kiosk that you can sign in to and they'll text you when you're at the front of the line so at least I can wander off around the casino. I throw caution to the wind when I'm here and forget about logging my daily caloric intake on myfitnesspal because inevitably we end up sitting around for 2 hours and I've eaten more than is reasonably safe. Anyhow, I think I've sampled a bit of everything here and everything is pretty good but the only area I care about is the seafood - which means shrimp, crab legs, oysters until I'm full. Only downside is everyone probably thinks just like me so the line at the seafood bar is quite long and it becomes sort of a pain to go through the line each time - but I guess it gives me time to digest the food while I wait. Their dessert bar is decent - although I only go for the chocolate covered strawberries, crepes, and mochi ice cream - everything else is standard."

S'Dined here on Thursday 4/4/13 with 5 friends. I will say that you can definitely eat your money\'s worth so that\'s not the issue. We all spent an additional $15 for "express pass" otherwise we would not have been able to dine at all (Total: $65.93+TIP). The "normal" line was long, REALLY long. I don\'t think the $15 "express pass" was worth it though because it didn\'t seem like we were a priority to the staff. Then they tried to squeeze 6 grown men into a table made for 4 people. We essentially used mob-rule against the lady seating us to takeover a larger table. Our waiter was great, he was 5 star. The cashiers, host/hostess, etc were 2 star. The food was 3-4 star. I am not a huge seafood person so I didn\'t try the crab legs but did look them over, meh. I tried various things, liked the sushi the most. They had little cheeseburgers, sort of like gourmet sliders - although only in appearance - they were DRY and way too salty. Could only eat one. Prime rib was good. Dessert offerings were good, especially the crepes. Surprisingly few offerings to pare with the crepe however. Can\'t say that I would wait in line for this buffet again.'

S"BEST. BUFFET. YET.\n\nWynn was always my favorite just because of their quality. M was delicious because of their quantity + price. But Bucchanal...I think tops both of these. We were the smart people who got in line around 1:45 pm and paid around 2:50...just in time to pay for lunch but get dinner food! We live such a dangerous life, don't we? \nWe did have a party over 6 people, so they charged us 18% tip. (Total was $36. My friends went for dinner, and with the 18% gratuity, it was like $51.) I don't really see the need to tip at buffets more than a few bucks, but what can we do...\n\nI think one reason I really loved this buffet was because of the ASIAN FOOD. Living away from home really makes me crave this! They had miso soup, hot and sour soup, and black chicken soup. They had sushi, PEKING DUCK, and other general asian dishes. The peking duck was sweet and delicious. I ate enough of that to pay for my meal.\n\nThey ran out of salmon at one point, and one of the chefs, after asking what I was waiting for, went to go get me some. How sweet!! Plus points for great service.\n\nThey also have a ton of seafood including crab legs and oysters. All of my friends got their money's worth eating that. \n\nThey had rib eye steak, fresh-made tacos, fresh fruit, lamb chops, amazing desserts including innovative ice cream flavors, and an all-around great selection of food. \n\nDEFINITELY RECOMMEND."

S"Hands down one of the best buffets I've had in Vegas thus far! The lines for this place is ridiculous but now they seem to have a more organized system. You come check in and get a receipt with a return time on it. Come back by that time and wait in a slightly smaller line to pay for your meal and be seated.\n\nThey have a large variety of food selections. What particularly stood out for me is the quality in each of them. Every single thing I tasted was quite good or at least tasted what it should be like, unlike other buffets where they would be great in one thing and lack in another department. They have one of the best dim sums I've ever tried and their ramen was surprisingly tasty for a buffet-styled ramen. They have all sorts of different drinks including tamarind and horchata. I love horchata so I was so pleased! Their tacos were also amazing. I've tried almost everything they had there. It's amazing, you have to go experience for yourself!\n\nI believe it's $30 for lunch and $60 for dinner. I can't remember the exact prices. Their dinner time starts at 3pm, so if you come around 2:30pm you can pay for the lunch price yet still be able to get dinner selections! :)"

S"King Of Buffet's!!!  This place is truly one of the BEST BUFFET's in Vegas.  The quality of food and variety is just ridiculous.  The decor is really upscale and very clean.  The service is excellent and the waiters are really attentive with refills and cleaning up used plates.  The price for the Buffet is on the expensive side but you get what you paid for in quality and variety.  The Buffet is situated inside Cesars Palace so parking should not be an issue.  My fiancee and I did not have to wait at all to get in because we had an early dinner around 5PM.  The usual wait from we have heard from others is between 1-2 hours depending on the day of the week.  \n\nI for one am a big fan of crab legs and oysters and Bacchanal really has one of the freshest seafood selections around.  Located literally smack dab in the front of the Buffet line right when you walk in so its pretty difficult to miss.  The meat selection is filled with massive slabs of everything you can think of.  One of my favorite was the lamb chops that was just delicious.  There is even a Udon/Ramen section where the chef will make whatever you like right on the spot and you can add the toppings on your own.  In the back where they have all the chinese food you can also find chinese chicken herbal soup that explodes with flavor.  The dessert section is also just out of this world.  They have a whole variety of mochi ice cream, gelato, and the usual sea of dessert cakes and goodies.  My favorite was the sesame mochi and the thai tea gelato.  \n\nI would suggest looking at the whole buffet selection before you start getting anything so you can get an idea of how massive the buffet actually is.  This way you can map out what you plan to get and not get stuck missing out on food because you are so damn full.  Make sure you wear loose clothes because you will probably need the extra space."

S'Bachelor party with my boys, came here for breakfast. It was my second creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, dug in, tastes bad. Egg inside tasted and looked rotten. I Tell manager, she says this week is pistachio flavor!?! She leaves to checks with chefs. Comes back, says " oh no it\'s green tea". Right...cause that\'s how it should taste. Horrible customer service. Tried to deny the buffet has issues. I\'m insulted she thinks as an adult i can\'t tell the difference between rotten, pistachio, or green tea. Second time here and this happens. How do you make a creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e with top yellow and bottom this nasty green color? Aside from THIS, buffets really nothing special to me. I prefer Bellagio.'

S'Not impressed with the food. We went there on a Saturday night and the place was so busy. We paid $54 per person. We thought there will king crab legs but guess what?  No king crab legs, only snow crab. It seems like the quality of the food has gone down compared to other Yelpers who posted pictures and reviews.  The lamb chops and the prime rib were tough and the sushi quality was the same as the supermarket. The oysters smelled fishy and the stone crab legs were hard to eat.  Some of the Asian hot dishes were good (roasted duck). Where were the individual fried chicken baskets? And the Mexican corn on the cob? This place was just like any other buffet now but more expensive. Yes, there were plenty of food but will not recommend anyone to go there unless you like spending money for lots of bad food.'

S'So beware.  Super crazy getting in here for lunch or dinner during the holidays.  Maybe other times too but we tried for lunch and wait was 5 hours.  But if you come early (say before 10 am) you can get in at a reasonable time.  \n\nBrunch buffet was a nice spread that included sparkling wine.   Omelettes, lots of shellfish, chicken dishes, potato, mini pancakes and waffles, sushi, and much much more.  Of course there are deserts and sweet rolls.  Main thing lacking was decent bread.  Found croissants and some other ones but no rolls anywhere.  \n\nGood overall was pretty good and fresh.  Waitresses did a great job keeping the glasses and cups full and tables clear.  \n\nWorth a try but not worth a long wait in my opinion.'

Fresh juiced juice. and almost any breakfast food you could think of. Everything tasted great. The staff was very friendly on the floor as well as behind the counter. Five star service and food. For breakfast they had seafood, American, Mexican, Indian, and Asian. We were not hungry again late that night. This is really an outstanding place that is worth the price.'

S'We arrived at about 6pm tonight.  I had a $50 food voucher for locals so I thought I would give this a try.  I was tempted to demand a refund but I kept thinking it had to get better.  \n\nFirst course was crab legs and several seafood items.  I asked for steamed crab legs and I got to the table and they were still refrigerator cold.  Every item I got off the hot seafood bar was still slightly refrigerated as well.  \n\nNext stop was the carving line.  I tried the sausage, brisket, prime rib and lamb chop.  Sausage was gross, brisket average, prime rib rubbery and bland and the lamb chop was average.\n\nI tried Italian next.  Pizza was room temp but burnt on the bottom.  Pasta was room temp.  \n\nCrepes were good and the man that did the carving was A+, as polite and helpful as could be.\n\nMy son ate mostly kid stuff.  He complained that fruit was warmish and everything else he had was room temp.  \n\nI would have rather had Golden Corral.  I guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful.'

S'I didn\'t get food poisoning so they avoided a one star.  Didnt come close to meeting expectations. Food was alright.  I can get better mexican fare at my local Chavez supermarket.  Forget the asian section. Spongey fried fish. Dry ribs. Less than crispy skin on the duck. Onion rings, blech. Over battered, over fried.  I know who goes to a buffet and eats onion rings?  This guy. We caught the tail end of lunch and the beginning of dinner.... Didn\'t see a whole lot of difference.  Desserts are ok. Nothing better than what you might find anywhere else. \n\nThe service is what really gets me.  Yes someone came to check on us initially, but after that.... We had the same plates sitting on our table for the better half of our "dining experience". And it wasn\'t like we were burning through the buffet lines. Quite the opposite in fact because we wouldn\'t have had anywhere to put new plates. NEVER had our water refilled (which led me to drink a lot of self serve horchata -- which was the highlight of the evening). I mean if you\'re not going to provide these basics at least provide a station where I can bus my own plates and get my own water.  Pathetic. \n\nIn short, come to this buffet so the lines will be shorter at Wicked Spoon.  I may have to give up on buffets altogether.'

S"Long due review where I had last time I came in April! \nThis place has become my new favorite buffet at least for me as I wasn't a fan of Wicked spoon. The best part of it was that we literally walked up and got a spot right away so that was the BEST part of it all. I don't think it will ever happen again at Vegas being able to not have to wait and get a spot!\n\nIt was around 32 per person last time I came here as we came around 2. I have heard that the price has gone up? but I'm not for sure on that yet. Regardless I had an awesome experience here where they had A HUGE VARIETY of food and desserts. We didn't have to get drinks as we had fat tuesdays coming in.\n\nThey have from chinese to american to mexican food so you can't go wrong if you are only into one group of food. I personally loved the mexican type of food they had here where there was a station where I could get forever tacos and they actually make the meat fresh for you and it was VERY GOOD. If i wasn't defeated, I would have got 3-4 more tacos... :p \n\nThey have a bunch of ice creams/sorbets, crepes, cakes, and even mochi. Just go all out people because I had a great time enjoying all the types of food they had here. \n\nI say...from my last time experience that this is my favorite buffet now."

S"Came here based on a recommendation made on Yelp.  This is a new buffet at Caesar's Palace and looks like they spent a pretty penny creating this place.\n\nI waited about 25 mins in line and noticed there were a lot of young 20-something asian kids.    To me that was a good sign as my fellow yellow brothas and sistas and I have similar food tastes (haha generally speaking).\n\nI sampled the goods before I committed to anything and surprisingly a lot of the food I ate was pretty good.\n\nThe woodfired pizzas were actually surprisingly good (I mean who the freak eats pizza at a AYCE buffet?).  I also sampled the prime rib which was cooked well and to my liking.\n\nEven the fried chicken was pretty good.\n\nThe dessert bar is amazing here... you can eat everything from gelato, to cheesecake and they even have freakin jelly bellies!!!\n\nMy fellow asians and I were hoarding the crab legs as well... \n\nThis buffet costs about 49 for lunch and is more expensive than your typical AYCE LV buffet but the quality level is definitely a notch higher than most.\n\nMy only gripe is the crab legs weren't as good as other buffets... just my 2 cents."

S'This is my new favorite buffet on the Strip! We came on a Friday afternoon, and somehow miraculously avoided waiting. Literally paid and walked right in. It was $32/ person. I loved that there were various cuisines and it was grouped accordingly. My favorites were the tacos. I thought it was comparable to taco places and there was even a full salsa bar to match. I also surprisingly loved the hot and sour soup and found it just as good as ones in Chinese restaurants, ha! Towards the end of our meal (or the beginning of dinner service), crab legs arrived. Yum. Some negatives would be the overdressed (thus salty) Caesar salad and the overcooked (thus dry) prime rib. The desserts looked really good too but I was so full I just had a scoop of blood orange sorbet. Restroom is in very close walking distance (right by the entrance) and service was average. I will be back!'

S'I have been here a couple of times but the overall score was a 3\nThe food was good but not spectacular\nThe Asian selection for the food was pretty tasty and well made and the seafood and desserts were tasty enough not to complain.\n\nI highly recommend you try the miso sea bass... So tender and it had the perfect balance of sweet\nThe mini cheeseburger was juicy but the bun was a tad on the dry side\nThe crab legs were a little on the salty side, but normally everywhere I go it has the same problem\nLast time I went they had monte christo sandwiches and red velvet pancakes that were amazing but this time around they weren\'t there.\nThe gelato ice cream was tasty and eaten like an appetizer while waiting for our waiter.\nThe churros tasted as it should but it seemed like it was sitting out in the heat lamp for a while\n\nThe reason the score is so low is two reasons.\nOur waiter Miguel had us waiting for 10minutes plus prior to even coming to our table to get our drink orders. We had to wait and even asked a guy walking around who told us "sorry I can\'t help you, I\'m not a waiter"\nOk. I get that you\'re not the waiter but at least TRY and find someone\nOur relief at the time? Jie, who even though was NOT our waiter came and got us drinks\nThe second reason the score wasn\'t good is the price\nFor 4 people we paid almost $300 due to Easter prices.\n\nThe only reason I would even consider coming back was the manager Ryan Gross\nWe saw him on the side and expressed our unhappiness and he was very quick to help us\nLet\'s just say that after he was involved we had people checking up on us and taking care of us like we were actually paying $300 for the meal. \nAfter some issues with our bill he comped us one meal which was greatly appreciated.\n\nSo after all of this? It has a lot of hype but if you go it won\'t be the best meal but worth it if you don\'t pay the over priced Easter version.'

S"Went here the other day with my family and we all loved it. At first everyone else was a bit leery of the $45 price point but after sitting down and trying all the food they all saw that it was worth it. Now this has to be the largest buffet I've been to, not just in terms of scale but in food selection as well. I was a little bit disappointed because some of the sections that I saw in photographs from other yelpers were no longer there (or had been condensed) but everything was still amazing. We spent a good 2 hours there and I would GLADLY pay another $45 to go there again. I'd say this place definitely beats out the Wynn buffet."

S"Could have easily been a 4 out of 5...but bad service and horribly inconsistent quality of the food drops it down to a 3.\n\nEveryone knows the deal at a buffet...quantity over quality.  No matter how much Vegas tries to reinvent the wheel with the promise of amazing quality, things always veer back.  The GF and I were excited to give Bacchanal a try while it was still new and for the most part we were very satisfied.  The afternoon was marred by a few annoying things.\n\nFirst off here are the highlights:\n-Sliders - 4 out of 5 - very good\n-Beef brisket - 4.5 out of 5 - one of my fav dishes there.  Don't forget the Chipotle BBQ sauce\n-Shrimp and grits - 3.5 out of 5 - ...could have used a bit more seasoning but still very good\n-Crab legs - 4 our of 5 for first batch 0 out of 5 for the second - first batch was great.  Perfectly cooked and easy to eat (since they were sliced in half), the second batch were HORRIBLE completely over salted and inedible\n-Corn beef hash with a quail egg - 3 out of 5 - could have used more seasoning and a bit more corn beef but still pretty good\n-Creme Br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e - 4 out of 5 - very good.  This was my GF's fave dessert\n-Chocolate Creme Br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e - 4 out of 5 - this was my fav.  I liked the deep chocolate flavor.  Not overly sweet.  Really liked it\n-Gelato Bar - 4 out of 5 - Great selection.  I tried the Aztec Chocolate which had a nice spicy flavor with good hint of spice.  Thai Tea and Watermelon lime sorbet were also great too.  The consistancy of the gelato could have been better.  They were a touch on the lumpy or pasty side, but the flavors were good\n\nThe Mehs:\n-The entire asian food section! Sushi was supermarket quality (not a compliment), the dim sum section was equally blah.  The steamed pork dumpling faired the best but was still just ok.  The sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaves was gummy and the Pho was nothing special...or even really all that ok\n-Prime rib was just ok\n-Braised pork belly was funky.  It was really fatty so it wasn't the most pleasant to eat\n-Cheese cake was kinda powdery instead of creamy\n\nAnd here are the lowlights:\n-Service was kinda blah.   There was only 1 guy bussing plates in our section so often they were stacking up\n-There was also only 1 waitress so getting refills on the supposedly bottomless mimosas or fountain drinks was hard.  We had to flag her several times.\n-The dessert section had a display showing all the items.  When i asked the lady where the creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9es where she gave me and my girlfriend a good dose of attitude saying that they were on the other side\n-Our second serving of crab legs inedibly over salted.  It was so salty I actually spit out my bite.  Not sure what happened but me and my GF went at different intervals and both of our crab legs were inedible so the whole batch wasn't cooked properly.\n\nOverall, not bad but still a little lacking.  We are definitely gonna try another buffet next time we are in town."

S'AMAZING! Until last night I told everyone I met that The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan was the best buffet in town. But no longer. The Bacchanal at Caesars is the new KING of Vegas Buffets. The selection is crazy, everything is fresh and the cooks are knowledgable and friendly. Have the pasta cook make you pesto chicken bow tie pasta....so good! For me, at a buffet, dessert is the deciding factor and this dessert selection is spectacular. Crepes, soufle, creme brulee, gelato (both regular as well as interesting flavors such as watermelon/mint and chocolate aztec), bananas foster, cakes, cookies etc. \n\nFinally, the price. Compared to other Vegas buffets it is awesome. During the week with your palyers club card is was $28.99 per person. You can\'t beat that in Vegas.\n\nMy only suggestion to Caesars is to train their staff better on the pricing specifics of the buffet. We asked 4 employees (concierge, Player Club and at the Buffet itself) about the prices and if there was a discount for having a players card and everyone gave us a different answer or simply stated \'I don\'t know" and all 4 were incorrect.\n\nOther than that, the place is beautiful and food is amazing. I HIGHLY recommend it!'

S"Eating at a buffet is all about choices and 500+ items automatically makes it 5 stars and the greatest daily buffet in Vegas history.  If you can't find at least 25 things you enjoy here, you might want to consider seeking professional help.  \n\nThey really excel at a lot of the buffet staples like pizza, sushi, and fried chicken.  A stand alone restaurant could be set up on each of these dishes and they'd average at least a 3 star Yelp rating for sure.  But you gotta love the unique food items like handmade tortillas, lamb chops, ribeye, ramen, kobe sliders and THEN the dessert section good lord!  My advice would be to check that area out first so you have some idea of what you may want to try before going for that 5th plate of Peking duck with a side of pasta.  I am not saying all the food is 4-5 star quality but Bacchanal Buffet is pretty amazing as a whole.  \n\nAvoid peak hours or try to find a gambling degenerate friend with a 7-star players card to avoid the line completely.  I was there on a Wednesday night at 8pm and the line wasn't long at all.  \n\nBravo to Caesars Palace for finally having a buffet worthy of their resort!"

Hostess sat us down, the 2 out of 3 of us went to go get food, we were gone 10mins or so. Come back & the waiter never came by to take our order for drinks. Another 10mins passes by and we see the waiter taking care of the other tables. We thought he would come to us after he checked on the table right next to us, but he didn't of course and walked away. It seemed like he never noticed that we were new people or we didn't have any beverages lol...  \n\nWe didn't see him for another couple minutes, so we told the hostess that he never came up to us and took our order. So she found him & nagged him, I saw from a distance, kind of made me laugh. After that, he finally he came up to us and took our order. \n\nAnyways, food there was grrrrrrreat! This buffet is now one of my favorites even though it's pricey it's absolutely worth it for sure! I really loved the way they presented the food, looked so nice. Loved how the chefs there could make you some things personally if they didn't have it out. \n\nOne thing I really loved was the crepes.

S'Super disappointed in this whole experience.\nFirstly, at about 4pm on the Friday before Memorial Day my husband and I called to find out the prices, and we were told $50 for dinner.  We got dressed and arrived around 5pm, only to find out that prices were actually $62/person.  We had just called about this information!!!  They would not honor the price we were quoted, but offered champagne, which we declined because we were driving (not gonna lie, I was a little irritated they wanted to make us another couple of drunks on Memorial Day weekend).  So we left that night without eating.\nWe returned today around 2:15 and hopped in line.  Although the line was almost all the way full, there was only ONE CASHIER letting people in.  Of course we are second in line to pay at 2:55, when they stop the line claiming the restaurant was too full and they could no longer let anyone else in.  Several groups behind us in line left.  At 3:05 they magically are able to open back up and we of course have to now pay the dinner price, despite the fact we were there waaaay before 3pm.  SUPER ANNOYING, and that on top of my raging hunger got the poor cashier a tongue lashing.  Not her fault, but a pretty shitty way to run a business, especially when we pass SIX empty tables on the way to our own and notice almost an entire section of tables empty; there was no way it was "too full" ten minutes earlier.  Thanks for ensuring we won\'t return, Caesar\'s.\nAnyway, on to the food.  Nothing impressive, I much prefer the buffet at Wynn.  The sushi was excellent for buffet sushi, there was a great bread selection, and a huge offering of desserts.  The overall selection is amazing, like fried pickles and edamame and like ten different kinds of salsa, but the quality is only average.  The pasta dishes had been sitting out to where the cheese had hardened, and the chef said he couldn\'t place more out until those were taken.  The line for the seafood stuff was ridiculously long, it went all the way into the American foods station. The dessert spread is massive, and I have a huge sweet teeth so I sampled everything I could fit inside of me!  The cookies and mini cupcakes (love that they are mini!) were divine, everything else was just meh.  The tiramisu, normally my fave, was awful!  Hubby isn\'t much a dessert fan but occasionally partakes and didn\'t like anything he tried.   Service was mediocre.  We had our dishes pile up a bit, but a glass never went dry and that was great. Overall, I would skip this buffet and use the money at a better restaurant elsewhere.  If you\'re set on a buffet, try the Wynn!'

You know that saying, quality over quantity?  Well, why not quality AND quantity!  Bacchanal has them both!\n\nThey have all types of foods...\nStarting from the front of the buffet\nSeafood: crab, oyster, prawns, mussels, clams, fish\nCarving station: prime rib, all kinds of sausages, different cuts of beef, lamb, chicken, pork\nAmerican: BBQ style foods, corn, mashed potato, hamburgers, mini hot dogs, sweet potato tater tots, scalloped potatoes, etc.\nMexican: (I'm not a huge fan of Mexican food so I don't quite remember what was here but there was a huge selection of dishes!) \nBread bar: tons of breads, multigrain, buns, corn bread, soft bread...but why waste precious stomach space on bread?\nJuice bar: adorable glass bottles filled with strawberry juice, hibiscus juice, horchata, mango juice, guava juice (I really wanted to take these cute bottles home, but you're not allowed to.  So sad)\nItalian: pizzas, meatballs, pastas, etc. my favorite was the cheese, dried fruit, and cured meats station!\nSalad bar: again, why waste precious stomach space on salad?\nAsian: sushi, rolls, build your own ramen, build your own udon, building your own pho, dim sum and dumplings, sticky rice, Chinese dishes, etc.\n\nDon't forget to go around the corner because there is another section that you don't want to miss out on.\n\nAnd last but definitely not least....my favorite......drumroll.....\nTHE DESSERT STATION!!\nSo many cakes, pies, chocolate covered strawberries, homemade marshmallows, cake pops, pastries, cookies, brules, tarts, cream puffs, a whole freezer of ice cream flavors, build your own crepe, build your own ice cream sandwich, Bubbies mochi ice cream (yes, correctly!  They fly over Hawaii's own Bubbies mochi ice cream!!)\nTip: when getting dessert, first go to the regular food area to pick up a plate because those are bigger than the plates at the dessert station.  That way, you can get more dessert every time you go up!\n\nAll in all, I ended up eating 9 plates and drinking three juice bottles (2x Asian food, 2x Italian food, 2x meats and other random dishes, 1x American food, 2x dessert).  I think I stretched out my tummy to a whole new level after eating here but once I started eating, I just couldn't stop!  You can really do some damage here since everything tastes so good.  Come hungry and leave happy!   Incredibly, wonderfully happy."

I don't remember how many times I've been here but it seems like it's almost tradition every time I'm in vegas. I do like that they changed the waiting system. Instead of making you stand in a 2 hour line, they give you a ticket and tell you to come back around a certain time.  Is it cheap? Definitely not. But the food is completely worth every penny.

Plenty of meat selections enough to give you a meat coma for sure. I loved the fried chicken. \n\nYes it is really expensive! I believe all buffets are expensive on the strip that are good, but do not go on a holiday otherwise it becomes really expensive and kind of ridiculous. \n\nI would say the issue for me is the long lines. Nobody wants to wait in those kind of lines. We got lucky and went at a strange time 3 p.m. not lunch or dinner and only had a 30 minute wait. I don't think I would give it such a high review if I had to wait 2 hours. \n\nSomething else I noticed was being really close to the person next to us, to the point where I heard their conversation then just started chatting with them because I kind of felt like I was a part of their conversation even though I wasn't, we were so close I felt like I was eavesdropping but it was not on purpose. \n\nOverall this is a buffet I would suggest to out of town visitors. I hope it stays good."

S"3rd time visit:\n\ngoing downhill!!  but the price is still the same or increased.\n\nThe price, is still the same.\n\nThe wait, has changed. You now have to pre-check in at the kiosk then it'll print out a little receipt where it tells you what time to go back to the podium to check in and then wait in line to pay. \n\nWe got there at 4:45 expecting a long wait.. but instead we had to do the kiosk thing and ended up eating at 7pm instead and we were in a time crunch since we had a show at 9:30pm. If we had known this early, we wouldn't have been so rushed. Anyway, so i'm giving you a heads up now.\n\non to the food. same selection but less. looks like they cut down on the desserts. back in january i remember being able to select from 4 to 5 different mochi flavors, this time, just two. There were more ice cream / sorbets back in january, now there were only less than one row of ice cream selection... the other row was DISPLAY ONLY.\n\nthe crab legs were alright. still not as meaty, however, it is better than the first time i've visited. The stone crab claws were not good - no taste. If i'm paying over $50 for buffet, i expect better quality seafood. Those crab legs need to be upgraded to fatter ones. Those skinny legs are not acceptable. I can get those crab legs at a different buffet for a much lesser price.\n\ntheir turn around time for plates were slow this time. There were times when there were no plates at all in almost all of the stations. \n\ni must say that this 3rd visit, was a let down. Most of the time i was just walking around thinking what I should get to eat. Nothing really stood out this time (except for their miso glazed sea bass).\n\ni'm not sure if i'll be visiting bacchanal again if they continue with this quality of food. It just wasn't as good as when they first started. If that's the case, i rather spend less money at a different buffet and eat mediocre food. why pay so much and also get [slightly above] mediocre food?"

S'A very fitting name for a veritable orgy of food! This one in true C\xc3\xa6sar\'s Palace grandeur is like no other Las Vegas Hotel and Casino buffet. It is really more like if an array of top level restaurants were in one section. The major cuisines are well represented. There\'s a seafood section that features a wonderful ice bar with delectables like stone crab claws, oysters on the half shell and snow crab legs among other things. They also have hot seafood offerings as well. The carving station is more like a BBQ restaurant that features brisket and spare ribs along with the prime rib, turkey, chicken and pork roast. They even have slider hamburgers on little plates that are ready for the taking. The Mexican section has some authentic standbys like chicken chile verde. chile colorado, and pozole, but they also have street tacos done to order featuring carne asada, chicken, and al pastor. The Italian section has some lovely pastas and pizzas cooked in a woodfired oven, and an Asian section that had some lovely sushi, stir fried dishes, and hot sour soup that was actually both hot and sour. Plus they had a salad bar that I just looked at and an awesome dessert island that had gelato and crepes to order along with creme brulee and chocolate mousse.\nOne of the things that I really liked about Baccanal is that many of the items were served "tapas style" meaning in individually sized servings. It made it easier to try a multitude of things rather than just filling up on just a few things. The quality of the food is top notch. The brisket and ribs tasted as good as they would have in any Texas barbecue smoke shack, and I\'m a native Texan so I know of what I speak. At any rate I ate entirely too much but it was worth it. So worth it that I will definitely do this again when I\'m in Vegas again!'

S'I\'ve only been there once and it was about a year and a half ago. I searched to see if it has been remodeled since I was last there and I cannot find any info saying so, so I\'m assuming that it is the same since I last went there.\n\nMy brother came to visit from out of town and for some reason he heard that this place was good and wanted to try it out. Being a local, I\'m rarely impressed with what the strip casino buffets offer compared to the local casinos because they all pretty much serve the same foods but the strip buffets are twice as expensive and twice as crowded. In this case both still stand true. \n\nFirst off, the wait to get in was about an hour and a half! Luckily I wasn\'t the one that had to wait in line so I just went to the casino and played while I waited for his call. Finally after an hour and a half he hit the front of the line and it was finally time to eat. \n\nThe first thing I noticed was the layout and design of the buffet. It is supposed to look like some French street market or whatever and there\'s the main dining floor which had like cobblestone paths or whatever and there were like little "rooms" on the sides which was where we were seated. It\'s a horrible theme and completely bad layout. The rooms looked like little village shops or something and had space for about 4 tables with about 20 seats or so but it\'s just a horrible design. My biggest complain about that is that if all of those walls were knocked down and all of the rooms were eliminated, they could probably seat another 200 people at any given time, which would alleviate, the wait in the line but getting more people in at once. I could see the rooms being a nifty little idea, especially if you\'re filling up that room with your own party but when there\'s 5 other parties in there, it\'s not so great. The rooms are somewhat isolated and are fairly quiet and it\'s not so fun hearing the other family\'s kids yelling and not having the buzz of the restaurant drowning it out. \n\nThe food\n\nThe food was nothing nothing special really. I honestly don\'t remember much about the food. It wasn\'t anything different than what I could have gotten from a local casino but for half the price. I think the cost was like $40 per person for a dinner buffet and for what we got, it was not worth it at all. \n \nOne thing I do remember is that the flow of the buffet was not good. People just kept cutting in front of me and had no clue on where the flow of the buffet line was and every time I went up to the buffet, I would come back aggravated and annoyed with how much side stepping I had to do to get from point a to point b. \n\nOverall, I\'d say stay away. For the money you\'re better off going to a nice place and ordering a decent meal opposed to going to a tourist buffet.'

S"Best buffet we tried.  The lamb was amazing!  You can make your own gyros but we opted for covering it in chateaubriand sauce and the caramelized pearl onions.  The other stand out dishes includes the roasted veggies (lots of options) and the pork with apples.  It didn't look appetizing, so I passed over it at first.  Glad I listened to the boys.  Best mashed potatoes ever!  Lots of pasta options, most of them bland.  They had real French macaroons and, of course, creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e.  Mini lemon meringues.  I would have been happy at a restaurant with a few of their options, so being able to have all of them plus a ton of creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e was worth the buffet price.  We had the unlimited wine, beer, champagne, or mimosas.  We figured that $12 per person for unlimited drinks was the price of, at most, 2 drinks in Vegas so we made sure we got our money's worth.   We would go back and were glad we missed breakfast and had lunch at Le Village instead.  It does look very Disney but that's better than crappy decor, I think."

S'My friend and I tried the breakfast as part of our "Buffet of Buffets" pass.  The food was outstanding!  Fresh breads, crispy bacon, and the crepes were delicious.  Our waitress was very courteous and attentive.  My friend and I had such a good experience that we decided to come back for dinner.  Our dinner experience was wonderful as well.  They had a wide variety of dishes ranging from seafood (crab legs, salmon, mussels) to sausages, pasta dishes, duck, and prime rib.  "Le Village" strives to be a top-notch French restaurant, so you won\'t find standard American fare here (fried chicken, ribs, large salad bar, etc.).  But if you\'re in the mood for a meal with a European flare and excellent service, I highly recommend this place.'

Croissants? Baguettes? Le sigh.\n\nI did like their French onion soup... And their creme brulee was pretty good, but honestly, the one at Planet Hollywood's buffet was better, oddly enough."

S"We recently went here for a Sunday brunch buffet. There were 4 of us and we had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated. We had all eaten here before and it had been very good.  Not so much now. As we walked around looking for our favorite cheeses, we discovered that they had really cheapened up the cheese tray.  There was no brie, no soft bleu or otherfwise, just some slices of what appeared to be cheddar or havarti.\n\nMany of the areas were empty and they were not quick to refill. I was excited to finally get a crab leg, but when I cracked it, the smell was so fishy that I chose not to eat it.  \n\nThe Prime Rib was very good and there was a good assortment of vegetables and fruit.\n\nMy husband had a made to order omelette, however, they didn't have any sour cream. The breads were good, not nearly the beautiful dessert buffet with French pastries that they had had in the past.\n\nThe service of the front line staff (hostess, wait staff) was good,   \n\nOveall, I was disappointed as I really felt that the quality had gone down hill. I remember when this was the best buffet in all of Vegas, not so much any more."

S'So, I went here with people out of desperation for food. Someone who had been here before recommended it so here I was at 8 PM. Service had placed us in a corner of a room and it was very stuffy. \n\nIn terms of the food, all I could taste was cheese, butter, and salt. I mean, I guess I expected it since it was a buffet.. Crab legs tasted funny and the soups were very oily.\n\nService was interesting because I felt like their waiters waited for tips. During the time I was eating, our waiter disappeared forever and the people next to me had a huge stack of plates that was piling. No one got refills of water and the place was looking dirty. You could always see the waiter with a dish cart near by, but he just kind of stood there and stared at us through the door way - it was kind of creepy. \n\nThe people next to us left without tipping, so after the waiter saw that, he began hawking us and constantly took away our dishes/gave us refills. There were moments where he just stood there in the room counting his money in front of us (signaling that we should give him a tip). The whole time he was doing this, the empty tables by us were still filled with stacks of dirty dishes.\n\nOverall, the food is sub-par and the service is creepy. :) Good luck.'

S"There's an abundance of chinese buffets in the Bay Area and they all offer mainly the same dishes.  Granted, the quality may differ, but in most cases, there's not much difference.\n\nI went to the Buffet at the Wynn last year and was overwhelmed by the choices available and the quality of the food so a Las Vegas buffet was on the list for this year's trip.  Upon arrival in Sin City, our first meal was at Le Village Buffet in Paris.  It's been years since I've been here and I couldn't see what was offered during the 30 minute wait in line.\n\nI was a bit PO'd about being seated at the far end of the room, until I took a peek at the grilling station right in front of us.  New York Steaks! Hot off the grill and incredibly moist. Just the steak here would've been worth the price of admission, but a quick trip around the buffet area and I found an abundance of crab legs (and not the skinny ones at the chines buffets), bbq ribs, fried chicken.\n\nIt's been years since I've been in Tokyo and had a freshly made crepe so I made a beeline for the crepe station where there was an abundance of choices for a fruit and dessert crepes.  If a banana and nutella crepe isn't to your liking, there's a huge dessert stand in the center of the buffet.  While you have most of the standard fare like cheesecake and apple pie, you've got to make sure you grab a freshly baked cup (or two) of creme brulee!\n\nThis was our one and only buffet stop during this trip because that was enough meat and seafood gluttony for the week!"

Friends that love their crab tell me that this place is great for that.\n\nHubby and I went for Champagne Brunch and our waitress was way cool. She kept pouring the bubbly until we said to stop! ;) The crepes, as always, are great. I didn't get to the meat carving station but hubby said that his pork tenderloin was fantastic!\n\nI only wish I would have saved room for dessert as they have an extensive dessert section.

S'i lost four pounds this past month, w/c i partly attribute to my Lenten fasting (multiple Fridays of being meat-deprived really). but, having been tres anorexic-looking all my life, i get angry at myself when my weight starts to dip below 110 (esp that 120 is my ideal weight for my 5\'3" height).  I then vowed to pig out right after Lent. and what better place to pig out, i thought, than the buffet places in Vegas. so, right after last Sunday morning\'s Easter mass, we hit the road for Vegas, with one thing on my mind - TO PIG OUT (specifically at Paris\' Le Village Buffet and at Bellagio\'s The Buffet)!!   =)\n\nI love love looooove this buffet.  In my opinion, this is THE buffet of all buffets, THE feast of all feasts.  \n\nUnlike Bellagio buffet, every dish here (as in EVERY dish), i tasted was flavorful (its sirloin the most uberdelish and noteworthy). Unlike Bellagio, dishes here were bathed in lush sauces.  Unlike Bellagio, we got sated here not  from the immense selection or quantity, but from the QUALITY of its dishes.  \n\ni must have gained at least a pound here.

We arrived early enough to avoid the lines that started to form shortly there after. And even then, the lines appeared to move quickly. The staff there were very attentive to it's patrons. We had heard from another guest the night before, that the omelette station was really good.  And they were absolutely right. In addition to the omelette's, they also had really good Eggs Benedict, and Crepes. Although my wife has a special request in regards to the making of her crepe, and the breakfast chef said they all come a certain way and did not deviate from the toppings and fillings of their crepes. That didn't set well with mommy! I addressed it with the managerial staff and our concerns were address and met. Other that that, everything was pretty good. My wife kept going back for their smoked salmon. I tried a little bit of everything from a variety of smoked sausages, Eggs Benedict , potatoes with sauteed sweet onions and had no complaints at all. The two kids were happy, and like I've said before....if mommy is happy, I am happy! Overall a very good breakfast. I am a fan!"

Unlike all the other buffets in Vegas, it tries to hold a French theme, but it is weird that it does have sushi in one of its houses. \n\nI really liked the meat station here and it was pretty damn good. Also, for some vegetarians, you might be able to find some stuff that you can eat like buttered potatoes or ratatouille. \n\nThe best part of this buffet is definitely the desserts! There is a little hut in the middle that offers french macarons! OMG. how i love french macarons. They taste SO FLUFFY that i'm going to die.. from its awesomeness! :) \n\nI thought it was a great deal coming here during dinner, they also have a gryos section. The only thing that I didn't like here was that the women's restroom was only one stall by the gyros section. Thank god there wasn't a huge line. \n\nOne thing that I highly recommend is sign up for the Total Rewards Card at any of the Harrah's properties and get the 24 hour buffet pass for 34.99 + tax.

By unexpected, I mean average. \nNot a lot of variety of food. I had 3 plates of food and came back with almost the same stuff. Prime rib is great - when is prime rib ever not?\nDo NOT get the "mashed potatoes". They\'re only semi-mashed..they\'re all mushed slices of potatoes. \n\nThe sushi bar isn\'t so great. There were only about 3-4 kinds of sushi, which weren\'t so great. I loved the shrimp & cocktail bar, all the shrimps just lying there. Also, get the crab legs, they\'re fresh!\nThe BEST part about the buffet was the crepe section. There\'s a long line for it but well worth the wait. The crepes are good, and you get to choose as much fillings as you want. Really nice lady behind the counter. \n\nAnd by the way, what\'s with people not leaving tips? At least leave a dollar for God\'s sakes, seeing that there are waiters there who clean up your mess. My waiter was so nice, very energetic, despite that he seemed old, but had my plates off the table once I\'ve finished, so huge props to him! \n\nI wouldn\'t say I got my $30 worth since I\'ve had better, but it\'s not the worst I\'ve had.'

We used a Groupon here, but I would easily come back without it.\n\nMain course: tasty duck, juicy lamb leg cuts and pre-cut crab legs\nDessert: Creme brulee was amazing and so was tiramisu and macaroons.\n\nThe reason I cannot give this 5 stars:\nService left much to be desired.

She even left us a canter of mimosa. \nThe food on the other hand was just OK. The highly anticipated cr\xc3\xaapes was the biggest downside after waiting 20 minutes in line to order. The cr\xc3\xaape was just too thick (it was more of a lighter pancake) and the filling tasted old due to being left out too long. The best dish was the clam which had a fradiavolo type sauce with it. They also had crab legs which were halved, so you don't have to crack it. The highlight of the meal was probably the cr\xc3\xa8me brulee which I had to sadly force down ( I was disgustingly full, probably after drinking close to a pitcher of mimosa because I certainly don't remember eating much of the food). \nTip: Decent brunch buffet, don't wait on the crepe line. I would suggest to try the cr\xc3\xaape place across, I heard better reviews from others while waiting at the cr\xc3\xaape station."

S"My family and I did the Buffet of Buffets thing when we went to Vegas a few weeks ago and we ended up here the most.\n\nThe food was excellent. Though the fare doesn't really stray into different ethnic cuisines, what's there is fantastic. I can't speak as to the authenticity of the regional variations of French cuisine that Le Village boasts, but it is certainly enough to have quite a selection.\n\nBreakfast: Crepes. The crepes were amazing. So light, fluffy and STUFFED with your choice of fruits and fillings. Make sure to try the prime rib hash and their eggs benedict! \n\nDinner: The prime rib was my favorite in all of Vegas. It was juicy, flavorful, tender, medium rare and just...mmm..... Various other accouterments of potatoes etc. were also fantastic. I did not get a chance to sample the crab. Most everything else in terms of entrees was also very good.\n\nThe desserts were sooooooooooooooo good. My girlfriend and I actually ended up coming back for creme brulee and frozen custard way after dinner, just because we could with the Buffet of Buffets pass. \n\nService was decent. Felt a little lonely sometimes waiting for refills in small groups, but when I went in large groups with my young niece and nephew, the waitresses were kind and attentive. A floor manager, whose name I was not able to get, was also very kind and brought us some small boxes of Fruit Loops for the kids when they weren't really enjoying the other breakfast foods."

We had a groupon, which came with a bottle of wine for 2 people - so it was a great deal! \n\nLove that they have a station for the different regional cuisines of France, in addition to the cold seafood station and amazing desserts in the middle. Seriously, save room. My friends all said this was the best desserts we had in vegas (the Wynn was up there too!) with macaroon cake pops, little tartlets, cakes, pies...you name it.\n\nBut on to the real food - main dishes! First, the crab legs weren't that great, so skip those and save room for everything else. The prime rib was amazing, and so was the pork with the apple cider reduction and baked apples that came in a single-serve skillet. Adorable and so flavorful! The salmon was also very good, as well as the fall vegetable hash with carrots, squash, onions, and a few other things I can't remember. It was great though. If i wasn't allergic to gluten I would've tried the make your own crepes station, which looked divine. I did however try the caramelized bananas by themseves...WOW they were good! They also have a mediterranean station with lots of crudites and sauces that are great for pairing with a lot of the other dishes you can get around the buffet. \n\nDon't fill up on bread - there's so many other good things to try!!"

S'Gee, this buffet used to be so good now it\'s horrible.   Was in Las Vegas last week and couldn\'t wait to eat at the Paris buffet.   This was our first stop upon arriving in Vegas.   What a letdown.   The line for the buffet wasn\'t that long but it took over 45 minutes just to get a table.  They didn\'t have enough people working.   The food quality and selection has really gone downhill.   No "Coq Au Vin."    That\'s what I was craving the most.   The made to order crepes are still quite good though.    The best buffet in Vegas now, in my opinion, is the Wynn which has good quality, high end food.'

It turned out that this wasn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nWhen we finally got to eat, we got the tail end of the brunch period, and they were switching the brunch food out for dinner food.  If you want to save money, come here at the end of lunch on a weekday, and eat the dinner stuff for relatively cheap.\n\nThere was a lot of expensivish food, like crab legs, bouillabaise, and various carved meats.  All of these were pretty good, although not really anything to write home about.  Unfortunately, I decided to fill up on the gnocchi, risotto, and onion soup (which were quite good) first, which didn't leave much room.\n\nThe desserts, including the crepe station, were awesome.  Probably my favorite part of the buffet.\n\nOverall, the buffet was quite good.  Although the food wasn't spectacular, I had a lot of it, and it was definitely worth the $25 or so that I spent.  Also, brunch on weekends includes champagne.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't really have any basis for comparison, as this is the only buffet I've been to in at least 3 years.  I'd probably also like to try the buffets at Wynn and Bellagio next time."

Granted we only visited one other on the list, Carnival World Buffet, but it was enough for us to notice if we wanted food w/ good flavor that Le Village Buffet was where it was at.\n\nIt is one of the smaller buffet's I've been to but they offer a lot of dishes of french cuisine that you can't find in any other buffets. Their prime rib was perfectly cooked and juicy. I LOVED their mussels cooked in this wine reduction, the duck was tender, and their potato dishes were delicious. I loved that some of the things were simple little dishes, but packed with great flavor. \n\nThey do have a crepe station! They can make them with any fruits and toppings they have on hand for you and they're all so delicious. If you come for breakfast/brunch they do have an omelette station and offer unlimited small bottles of Korbel champagne.\n\nThe wait staff and service is slow. We came on a Saturday night and after being seated it took over 15 minutes to get our drinks. I was wondering what was taking so long and noticed it was only one guy taking drink orders and serving them on our side of the buffet. They are extremely over worked.\n\nTheir creme brulee was the best ending to a delicious meal. A second creme brulee was even better ;)"

Then there was nothing to eat and the prime rib was just ok and for the other meat dishes the meat was so tough i had a hard time putting my knife through it. I was still hopeful for the ready made crepes but they failed to satisfy. The berry crepe was wayyy too sweet and the savory crepe was just so-so. Even the bread wasn't so good- I mean i've had better bread from my local supermarket.

It had a foul odor so it may have been old. \n\nThe service was extremely lackluster. We had to flag down the waitress twice just to get more coffee. \n\nOverall, you get what you pay for.

The line moved quite quickly as they were still trying to seat people when we arrived. The ambiance definitely stands out compared to any other buffet I've been to. They have a little building in the middle just for the dozens of desserts that they offer. \n\nThe prime rib here is pretty good although this time around, a lot of the meat was medium rare. They have a crepe station that serves both savory and sweet. The sweet crepe is very filling so be sure to save that till the very end. \n\nThis buffet has a lot of variety and it's hard not to find something that you would like. \n\nKey: When I was leaving around 700-730, there was a line with at least 75 people in it.

S"Quite delicious and a decent price for Vegas.  We went for the Champagne Brunch and our ambition was to arrive early enough to pay the breakfast price and rollover into lunch/brunch, heh. but our intentions to wake up early in Vegas after a night out drinking was a poorly planned one. We arrived at 10ish, but the line was loooooong.  I believe we waited about an hour and got to the cashier just after brunch started so we paid the full $25 pp.  \nI think it's one of the prettiest dining areas for a buffet I've ever been to.  It's set to look like a lovely French village with painted skies, gardens and shops.  It really is quite quaint. and comfortable.  \nThere was a nice variety of food.  The grilled veggie and meat station wasn't very good (meat was very dry), but the pastas, risotto, carved meats, and salads were reportedly delicious.  I wouldn't know.  I gorged myself on crab legs (they were salty and sweet and tender. yum!) and breads (yummy pretzel rolls and hard rolls).  \nThey had a nice variety of desserts, the usual cakes and pies and icecream machine (but nice dipped cones with sprinkles and such) and mini creme brulees.  I was bad and took two creme brulees with the intention of only scraping off the very topmost crisp burnt sugar layer. :D"

Considering that the buffet is $19 per person, the discount is pretty substantial. \n\nWe went for lunch on a wednesday around 1, and there were no lines.  The cashier lady was nice enough to extend my one $5 off voucher to my boyfriend as well, so we really saved $10 in the end. :) :) :) I WAS SO HAPPY. We thought the buffet would be our splurge meal! \n\nOn to the food... THERE IS SO MUCH FOOD. I know you're only supposed to take a bite of everything the first time around, but I was too distracted by the roast duck. It had some sort of sweet fruit glaze on the outside; I took double helpings-- bad idea. http://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l18/AyJee/IMG_6993.jpg\n\nThe shellfish wasn't too great, and I'm a little sad I wasted precious stomach space on them. Focaccia roll? Nice and chewy. Roast mushrooms? Perfectly seasoned. Tri-tip? Nice and pink in the middle. Buffet food is typically pretty meh, but how can you miss out on a Vegas buffet? This was one of the better buffets I've been to during the last 10 years. $15 well spent.\n\nRound 2: http://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l18/AyJee/IMG_6996.jpg\nMore mushrooms! Caesar salad + plain romaine (pre-mixed salads are often so heavy on the dressing!), creamed spinach + artichoke (YUM), sole, marinated tomato and mozzarella balls. \n\nMy tips would be to go easy on the pasta, get the duck and roast beef, get veggies (minus the asparagus), and don't get shellfish.  The fish is alright, the mediterranean section's got great sauces (pesto aioli! :D), and SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!\n\nObserve: http://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l18/AyJee/IMG_6994.jpg\n\nAnd that's only one side of the dessert island!  I tried a little of several desserts...\nhttp://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l18/AyJee/IMG_6996.jpg\n\nMacarons. So Frenchy and so good! I also heard the creme brulee and custard were good, but I was SO full I couldn't even think about putting creamy, heavy food into my stomach. However, I did squeeze in a little bit of space for a childhood favorite.  The apple crumble was divine-- hello, childhood memories! Paired with a dollop of soft serve, it was fantabulous! http://i92.photobucket.com/albums/l18/AyJee/IMG_6998.jpg\n\nThe bf and I were stuffed for the rest of the day; we made use of a groupon on our way home, but took home most of the food. I legitimately thought I was going to die of fullness. Standing up straight was definitely an issue, but boy am I glad I went to Le Village! I did a little research beforehand on best buffets on the Strip, but ended up choosing Village over Bellagio due to the reviews for the dessert bar. ;) Sweet tooth win."

S'Normally I go to a to fill up on food after working out or not eating, basically looking for quantity and decent quality food.  I don\'t expect to have a 3 star Michelin experience a buffet or even a 1 star.\n\nIn Vegas most of the buffets are decent with the standard prime rib (which is probably "choice" and not "prime") and other favorites like crab and shrimp.  \n\nThis was the first time that I\'ve been to Le Village Buffet and will probably make it a place to go when ever I\'m in Vegas.\n\nFirst off, the variety is top notch with a full array of a French menu.  \n\nWhat really surprised me was the braised pork belly with apple and sweet potato.  It was juicy with just enough fat to really add flavor.  And by the way, exercise dieticians state that you need fat in your diet to provide energy for your work outs.  \n\nOther things to try are the macaroni in a truffle cream sauce (probably ground truffles or truffle oil), crepes (both savory and sweet) and vegetable side dishes (which I usually avoid since you need to maximize your dollar value).\n\nThey had shrimp and crab legs, which I guess can be considered French cuisine, except it was just blanched and served cold. \n\nWhat was weird was the small section of sushi with a couple of trays of tekka maki and California role.  I guess they wanted to cater a little to the Japanese tourists.  But the ones I saw were eating everything but the sushi.\n\nNow the important part...the desserts!  Creme brulee, flan, macaroons, crepes, frozen custard, bread pudding, fruit tarts and lots of cookies.  Yes, I tried them all.\n\nI don\'t really like the macaroons, but I had to give them a try.  Still don\'t like them.\n\nIf you want to go to a Vegas buffet, go directly to Paris.  In my opinion its the best on the strip!'

S'Loose jeans with a hint of stretch - $10.00 (a steal, I know!)\n\nA flowy top that covers your stomach - $30.00\n\nCab ride from the Monte Carlo - $7.00 (tip included)\n\nDinner - $24.50\n\nEating until you think you might actually die... priceless.\n\nThis was the first time I had eaten at the Paris buffet for dinner and I was quite pleased. We went later in the evening (around 8ish). Being a lover of buffets, I usually go to the Bellagio for dinner. Or else I wanted to try the Wynn. But my friend convinced us by telling us that they have fondue (melted cheese, my favorite!). But when we got there.... no fondue. We asked the waitress and it seems that they stopped a while back. So for those of you expecting fondue, THEY HAVE STOPPED THE FLOWING OF THE CHEESE. \n\nBut otherwise, it was a pretty good deal. It was cheaper than other buffets and luckily there was no line. One thing I enjoyed was the fact that they had dungeness crab as well as king crab. I enjoy dungeness so much more. The grilled vegetables section was GREAT. The asparagus was the size of a curling iron! They also had some great seafood. The sushi (apparently a French food) was mediocre. \n\nAlso, they have all these small rooms to emulate the ambiance of a quaint French village. But I kept getting lost on my way back from the buffet! Be sure to leave a trail of crumbs when you get up to get food.'

However, on this last visit, we felt the quality had declined.\n\nPros: Crepes made to order, a good selection of cheeses, clean restaurant, parisian theme is fun, little red breakfast potatoes, panacakes, variety of options\n\nCons: Croissant was stale, the long line (30-45 min wait on avg), belgian waffle was hard as a rock.'

So unimpressive I cannot even remember any of them and I checked them out twice! \n\nThe crab legs at dinner were some of the best at a buffet ever!  They were ice cold and not sitting in hot water like I have had so many times, so they were very flavorful and not watered down.\n\nOne of my favorite dishes was the creamy pasta with truffle oil!  Yummy flavor!\n\nThe service both times was very good.  There was a line but I don't know how long the wait was because I got to skip the lines ;-)\n\nIt's a buffet and kinda expensive but what isn't in Vegas?  \n\nMy recommendation is to only go once to this (and probably any) buffet on your visit to Vegas because the lunch had the exact same food as the dinner minus the crab legs!"

S"Yuck! I didn't like this place at all. I felt absolutely cheated paying a buffet price for the amount of food I ate. My husband booked some discount-price tickets to this place, so we went there for dinner one night during our Vegas vacation. \n\nThere are different stations, like any buffet, where you can get different kinds of food, most of it European. I tried really hard to like the food. Not much of it looked appetizing. Even less of it tasted that way. \n\nShrimp and crab legs are my go-to items for Las Vegas buffets. They're usually safe, right? Well, the crab legs were cold, not hot. The melted butter was barely lukewarm, so by the time you walked back to your table with it, it was congealing. Still, I could make do with the crab legs, but that's not much of a buffet, is it? The absolute worst part for me was the shrimp. I dipped it in butter, bit down, and CRUNCH. What the hell kind of lazy-ass place doesn't de-shell the shrimp before serving it? Plus, if it's not de-shelled, then it's certainly not de-veined! Crunchy, poop-filled shrimp should not be on anyone's list of things to eat while in Las Vegas. If you want real seafood (and variety) at a reasonable price, go to the buffet at Harrah's."

S'First off, I have to confess. "I do not really like buffets!"\n\nI have now cleared the air. We were recently on a large family outing in Vegas. We did the Bellagio and the Le Village Buffets. Hands down the winner is Le Village, because the service is better, the wait is shorter, the price is lower, the dining area is bigger so you do not sit in the lap of the couple at the next table, and finally the food is as good or even better. \n\nYou can call me a romantic or something, but I like there is a consistent theme in the buffet.

I don't care if you're still hungover from the previous night's antics, brunch isn't the same without mimosas! \n\nMost of the food was really good. My friends went nuts for the snow crab legs. We had plates and plates of those. No shame in our game! I'm not a shellfish kind of girl, but even I will admit that they were good. The steamed mussels and prime rib were really good as well. The quality and presentation of the food was spectacular. (Avoid the sushi they have in the corner; I know you did not just stand in line for over an hour to eat subar sushi!)\n\nThe dessert bar was amazing as well! They make the best creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e here, really!

S'We visited Le Village early on a Thursday night and were not sure what to expect based on the varying Yelp reviews. However, I must say that both my wife and I were pleasantly surprised. \n\nThe wait was nearly nonexistent (it was early Thursday after all), and we were seated within five minutes despite having no reservation. Our server was friendly, but was clearly having to man a lot of duties, as it was a good 10 minutes between each visit. \n\nBut of course any buffet lives and dies on the food, and the fare here ranges from average to surprisingly good. The highlights were the fantastic crepe station ("Le Singe", a banana and hazelnut crepe, was excellent), the flan, which was some of the best I\'ve had buffet or otherwise, and the seafood offerings like bouillabaisse and arrabiata mussels. The other entries were all passable to good, and I cleared all three plates. \n\nThe price might be a touch high, especially with the Bellagio across the street for a few dollars more, but I actually preferred this buffet to the Wynn which we are in the same week. It\'s a quaint French countryside take on the Vegas buffet and a fair choice for your bachanalian endulgence.'

It had similar quality food to the MGM Grand buffet that we had eaten breakfast at the day before, but less selection. They have a crepe station thingy here, but I didn't think those were all that great, so what is the damn point. \n\nReally, I would only be giving it two stars, except for one thing: You can pay an extra $10 per person and get right to the front of the line! Yessir, capitalism at its finest, and I was more then happy to pony up the extra dough at noon on a Sunday when every breakfast buffet in town had an hour wait to get it. \n\nSo, if you're a stepper, and you're starving, and all the buffets in town are packed, this is a good place. If you're a mooch, and the line is long, keep walking."

Granted, the line is terribly long but if you come a wee bit early (around 5:30pm?) chances are you will get in within 20 minutes.\n\nI particularly liked the coq au vin, and the duck confit was awesome! I enjoyed the grilled chicken and thought it went really well with the grilled pepper, summer squash, and zucchini.\n\nThere were some thin crispy, dare I say, flat breads that had a great umami taste that I had multiple helpings of.\n\nThere were the snow crab legs and crab claws that every other person seemed to be raving about but I didn\'t try any of them. I, however, partook in wolfing down copious amounts of the shrimp cocktail. \n\nThe dessert spread was ok though it, I felt, didn\'t befit a "french spread." That still didn\'t stop me from enjoying the delicious bread pudding with whipped cream.\n\nThis buffet is also part of the so called "seven-buffet" deal where you get a 24 hour pass to pig out on any or all of the (seven) buffet spreads across on the Vegas strip.\n\nI will definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas!'

It's your standard buffet with some unique offerings (pate). Their service is consistent - they take away your plates promptly and your glass is never empty. (For breakfast, they leave you a carafe of coffee.)\n\nBut the best part about this buffet is the made to order crepes. They have some fruit at the station (usually blueberries, apples and peaches), but they'll make them with other stuff too. The well kept secret is that they'll make you a nutella crepe. Oh hells ya. Grab some strawberries or bananas from the fruit section first and then go over there and ask them to make your crepe with your fresh fruit. You can garnish with the whipped cream and slivered almonds or to be completely indulgent, they have a caramel sauce. My sweet tooth thanks this buffet for another great place to be indulged."

A good way to get drunk if you ware inclined to do so. Some of the items like the crepes were a crowd pleasers and thus long line on that station. Tipping the server in advance is a good idea as you get decent service this way. Dessert station is decent. A reasonable buffet option. I liked some of the grilled items.

The only reason we didn't go was her friend didn't want to spend the $30/head to eat dinner there.\n\nFast forward to a trip I made with my boyfriend, I insisted we go.\n\nWe stood in line for probably 20 minutes, forked over our cash, and were taken to our seats.\n\nThis is a true buffet - it is just random foods that really having nothing to do with Paris.\n\nThe salad bar looked pretty rough so I skipped it.  Boo.\n\nI actually couldn't find anything that was really delicious.  I was eating just to fill up as opposed to enjoying and appreciating the food, flavors, presentation.  YES, it is a buffet, I get that, but the food tasted really boring.  Heck, the Orleans buffet blows this one away.  They boasted of their giant crab legs when we were paying (before eating), but the guy in the seafood hut told us they haven't had them in a week.\n\nThe drink lady took forever to come around.  We were finished our first plate by the time she came over.\n\nI really wanted to love this place, so much that I was willing to be pretty forgiving.

I don't think the guy cooked my omelette enough since it wound up being a little runny.  Oh well, the made to order crepes (which are HUGE!!!!!) more than made up for it!

S'I think that the quality of this buffet has dropped substantially as of recent.  The quality of the food was mediocre, but what I found more disturbing was just the overall hygiene of the place.  All of the food stations were a mess, food dropped everywhere and no one was cleaning it up.  There was food on the floor that people were slipping on!  The prime rib was so tough that it was difficult to chew.  The one major highlight was the crepe station but, the crepes that the customers were eating across the street looked a lot better.\n\nNeedless to say, it was utterly disappointing.  Personally, I would spend a little more and eat at the Bellagio or Wynn.  Overall, it can be best described as the gourmet Hometown Buffet.  The decor is nice b/c it is supposed to make you feel like you are eating in an outdoor cafe.  My friends who ate with us remarked at how much the quality has dropped since they came here several years ago.  It may be due to the recession or being part of the Buffet of Buffet ticket.'

S'Im giving the buffet a generous 2 star rating. I found it to be overpriced and under stocked. We went there for the dinner buffet and it was a disaster. Too pricey, and too long a wait for such crappy food. There was not a decent variety of food choices. The crab legs were old and there were only 20 or so out and they were not being replenished by the staff. By far the worst buffet in Vegas. Save yourself some time and go to the Creperie across the hall from the buffet. For $8.99 you  have a delicious huge crepe that will fill you better  than the buffet ever could. I would not return to Paris on my next trip to Vegas. I wasnt too impressed. It is no Venetian. I recommend the buffet at Mandalay Bay as it was the most impressive with the best choices, and the Wynn Buffet as a close second. And do not forget Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay.'

There's multiple stations, including my favorite, the crepe station! I came here for the dinner buffet at around 3:30pm, so everything was super fresh. The prime rib was super tender and the crab legs were pre-cut and juicy. The crepe station had made-to-order sweet and savory crepes. My bf and I tried the banana and nutella crepe and the blueberry and raspberry crepe; both were AMAZEBALLS! The dessert station had a large selection, including creme brulee, creme caramel, ice creme, and an assortment of macaroons. Our Groupon for the meal included wine; the price for each glass would otherwise be $3 which is quite reasonable.\n\nTo better explain why I decided to give this place 5 stars, I had a Groupon that actually expired in July. I stopped by in August to see if they would be willing to honor my Groupon. The manager Steve told me that he would be able to honor my Groupon the next time I was back in town.

I did not stay in Paris so I can't review the hotel but as I walked through the hotel to the buffet I got a glimpse of it and it was so cute. They have little patisseries and French signs all over to make it feel authentic. The line for the buffet was quite long but moved surprisingly quickly. I was adamant about eating a crepe for breakfast so I refused to leave. What I really liked about this buffet in particular is they do not take a break from breakfast to lunch or dinner they just gradually change the dishes so I got to sample the breakfast and lunch buffet. The food was soooooo good. I had this amazing steak and potato has with real chunks of tender beef, smoked salmon, something that resempled scalloped potatoes without the cheese but lots of saut\xc3\xa9ed onions and mussels. They have stations that represent the different regions in france which I thought was a good idea and helps break stereotypes. I have no complaints about the food!  I wanted to go on my last day but I didn't have enough time. The crepes were divine. I ordered the mixed berry one and walked over to the ice cream stations and topped it off. PERFECTION! Next time I'm in vegas I will be stopping here for brunch.   My only point of criticism if the bathroom. There was only one toilet in a buffet! Which means line ups.

S'Earns a 4 star for recent improvements and better attention; however, come here expecting the longest of lines- sometimes 90 minutes to get in.\n\nThey have a great selection of seafood, desserts, Krepes, cheese, and deli. Also, some great French styled cuisine. Service is a solid 4-star, design is also about 4 stars.\n\nLocated right between Ballys and Paris Las Vegas, it is at the center of a lot of traffic. Come here with your Buffet of Buffets pass.'

S"Of the 3 buffets (Village Seafood at Rio, Planet Hollywood, and Paris) I went there during my Buffet of Buffets 24-hour run, this was my favorite because of the ambiance and pretty fresh variety of food.\n\nWe went for breakfast/lunch at 11 am.  We got in about 40 minutes later and stayed until 1 pm.  I really enjoyed the variety of foods here, especially the large selection of desserts.\n\nI went directly first to the crepe line, since I know it's popular.  It was pretty good, but very sweet.  You get to pick what goes in your crepe, and I chose blueberries, strawberries, and banana.  Only the banana was fresh.  The berries were just preserves.  Someone asked if they had fresh berries/fruit, and the lady (1 lady making tons of crepes for everyone in line), said they hadn't had fresh fruit in a while. \n\nI then went over and looked at the desserts and got an omelet made.  It was a standard omelet with nothing exciting, though the guy who made our omelets was really friendly.\n\nI LOVE seafood and was very pleasantly pleased to find a lox (cream cheese and smoked salmon on a bagel) station.  There were bagels, cream cheese, smoked salmon, and capers.  I loaded my plate and really enjoyed my lox more than anything else.  I wish I had room to eat more of it, but I sadly discovered this station at the end.\n\nI thought it was pretty cool that they also had a little Mediterranean station.  I was too full by then to try anything from there.  And by about noon, I saw people started stacking their plates with crab legs for lunch. Not sure if they had those out earlier, but I sure didn't notice people with them during my first round.  I stuck to the breakfast stuff, since I could only get that once a day.  \n\nI don't know why, but I really liked this place a lot.  The food wasn't super unique, but the people who served at the stations were really nice.  I also loved the ambiance.  Some buffets look super old and outdated.  This one was nice and felt more cozy.  Though it's not Paris, it did remind me a lot of my visit to Paris (which may also be why I liked this place).\n\nI would definitely go there again for breakfast, even without the Buffet of Buffets card."

S'We went here for dinner.  Overall it was a good buffet! The truffle pasta and brie and bacon mac n cheese were my favorites.  The desserts were delicious, esp the nutella/banana made to order crepe, and creme brulle.  \n\nHOWEVER!\n\nIn the 90 minutes we were there, our waitress came by to refill our drinks ONCE- and that was within 5 minutes of us receiving our first round.  She was rarely around to clear our dirty plates, we usually had to seek out a bus boy to take them.  And my aunt compared their service and attitude comparable to the service and attitude you would find in Paris itself (enough said on that!)  But their delicious food will still keep me coming back despite this :)'

S'this just might be my favorite buffet place in all of vegas for brunch! bottomless champagnes and crepes! i feel like this place is really underrated compared to the other "bigger" buffets at the more popular newer hotels. The price is reasonable when you compare it the other brunch buffets and especially restaurants. the way i eat, there\'s no way i can get a better deal anywhere else. the food they have here is pretty standard, you have your meats, desserts, and seafood stations. what makes this place totally worth it for me is the crepe station. holy crap their friggin savory crepes are to die for. i haven\'t tried TOO many crepe places, but i can\'t imagine it being any better than le village. i definitely try my hardest to make it to brunch here everytime i\'m in vegas'

S"Yum, yum, yum, I love buffets!  This one is up there on my list.  It had maaany different options to choose from, although most where french themed.  My favorites were the breads, the lamb, the creme brulee, the chocolate rimmed ice cream cones, the crab legs, the salad, the goat cheese, and last but not leas the Hummus! Yeah, I know, you say who eats hummus at a buffet?  Well, this was the best hummus I have ever had, and I don't even like hummus, AND I'm Greek...so there...eat hummus at this buffet.  I went here 2 days in a row, I don't usually do buffet twice in a weekend but my friend wanted to.  The first time we went for friday night dinner there was no line and I paid about $20 cause I got 5$ off from a reciept that I had from lunch at the hotel that day.  Saturday and Sunday they have champagne brunch even though they don't really advertise it...$26...and the line was huge.  The items I think you should not waste your stomach space on are the sushi (obviously, right?) the rice was nasty and the cheesecake."

S'i am SO MAD AT YOU, paris buffet!\n\nSome background story, my family and I get in line at 9pm. We have a party of 16 (I have a huge filipino family, and this was only a small portion of them). It takes at least 45 minutes to get into the buffet. Understandable. They seat us together and are very friendly. \n\nThe only thing I wanted at this buffet was the creme brulee. I\'ve been to this buffet THREe times and have always gotten their creme brulee because it\'s freaking DELICIOUS. WELL, the buffet "closes" at 10pm. I THINK that means they stop letting people in at 10. Well I think it ALSO means that they stop cooking at 10 because when I went up to the dessert island to get my creme brulee, they were OUT and not making anymore.\n\nUM NO. If my family is gonna pay 25+ dollars per person, you BETTER have some freaking creme brulee because it\'s the best dessert on your dessert island. Don\'t let people into your buffet if you are going to run out of food. You are a BUFFET so you should continue making your food, even if you are closing.\n\nDO NOT come here anywhere near closing time. Even an hour ahead of time isn\'t early anough. You will be extremely disappointed when they start running out of food. DEFINITELY not worth your money, believe me. :/'

S'This was my first experience with this restaurant/buffet.  It was divided into many different sections, but had a lot of the standard things you\'d expect at a buffet.  The food was pretty good, but not the best I\'ve ever had.  But for the quantity, you can\'t really go too wrong.  \n\nThe theme of the village was really cool as each area had it\'s own little house.  The desert house was right in the middle and had great selection including pretty fresh crem brule and macaroons!  \n\nThere is a wine section, but it\'s "exclusive" and not for just anyone.'

When i go to vegas, i don\'t go to gamble much.. i go for the buffets!!!!!!! \n\nParis buffet is probably my 3rd avorite buffet to go to after bellagio (first) and planet hollywood (2nd). \n\n25.99 for dinner on a friday night. long wait. but it was all worth it. \n\nWe got seated and waited forever to get someone to take our drink order. My boyfriend was excited that the drink was included. So he ordered a water, iced tea and a sprite. For some reason, the server gave us attitude, "3 drinks for one guy?". Dude Lady, we paid for drink included and we\'re getting our freakin moneys worth! I\'m all about customer service, but she was just rude and dissrespectful. \n\nMy favorite items are OF course:\nShrimp Cocktail \nCRAB LEGS! with lots of clarified butter!!!!!!!\nBouillabaise (seafood soup. i love the potato balls!) \nCheeses!!!! \nCreme Brulee\n\nStraight up, delcious buffet. Good Eats for a good price. \n\nAwesome array of desserts but not as good as bellagio\'s or spice market. \n\nA MUST!!!!!!!'

S"Umm. WOW. I've heard mixed reviews about Las Vegas buffets, but this buffet is no joke AWESOME! Lunch buffet is 20, incl tax. Bring cash to tip, because you pay for the buffet in advance. I will agree with other reviewers; the wait is a pain in my arse. However, it seems standard compared to the wait at other buffets on the Strip.\n\nThey have a lot of French dishes. I got to try ratatouille, or as my nephew call it, ratatooti. I also found out, I don't really like it. They have a small selection of breads (cranberry, garlic and basil, regular French bread) throughout the buffets. I love how they have plenty-a meats and vegetables. Their glazed sweet potato and green beans were so delectable and yummay! They have grilled bell- pepper, squash, hummus, red potatoes, brussel sprouts, broccoli florets, you know, the good shite.  The meats include beef, pork, lamb, chicken, fishies. There's also a small selection of (crappy) sushi, but I could care less for the sushi when there's plenty of other good foods abound. \n\nThe dessert selection is crazy. They have raspberry tarts, with 5-6 jumbo (and juicy) raspberries to top. They have cr\xc3\xa8me brulee, flan, various cakes, banana foster, ice cream, cookies, ay yay yay! \n\nThe servers are cute little ladies dressed as provincial French maids. Fin."

S"I can definitely see why people are fans of this place. However, I'm not in that boat.\n\nLet's start with the wait. We came at a time where it should have been well after lunch time rush but there was still a 20 minute wait. If I'm driving into the middle of nowhere, the food better be damn good!\n\nWe ordered the Mr. Ho's burger and the oxtail chili cheese fries. \n\nThe Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries: While it was interesting and enjoyable, it's not something I personally would crave. Was it tasty? Yeah I suppose... but the fries itself isn't specially made extra good. While eating it, I couldn't help but compare them to McDonald's fries. They were 11-12 dollars. \n\nThe Mr. Ho's Burger: I definitely had better burgers! The bun was taro flavored, or so its said, and therefore it's purple. Unfortunately, you're not able to taste any subtleties because the sauce was so overpowering. We split this burger and I'm raised with the voice of my parents saying there are starving children in Africa if a grain of rice is left on my plate, even till today, but I simply couldn't finish this half of my burger because of how strong and over-applied the sauce was. And this was only half a burger. This was also about 12 dollars. \n\nPerhaps the rest of the menu items are sublime, that's a possibility. But there was definitely a disconnect between the food I got and the raving reviews. It's hip and trendy and could very well be a spot in the middle of West Hollywood or Downtown LA, but I'm very sorry to say it felt like this place was more hype than substance. I know I'm definitely in the minority on this.\n\nOverall: Like the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries, don't regret getting it but I wouldn't do it again."

S'Having experienced Japanese/American fusion burgers before (fist to chest bump with two fingers kissed in the sky for you B Man\'s) I still thought that the food at Bachi Burger was fresh, innovative and most importantly, delicious.  Bookending our first Vegas trip together, mi corazon was absolutely adamant that we stop by this restaurant on our way back to LA...  which made the 8 hour drive back home somewhat more palatable...  somewhat.  :T  More on that later.  \n\nAnd on a related note, I firmly think that the mindlessly reckless drivers that one invariably encounters on the long stretch of road between the IE and Las Vegas are terrible people...  and if they crash their cars in the median due to their utter stupidity, they should be left to their own devices.  \n\nWith that said, Corazon immediately declared to all within earshot that she had decided on the Shogun burger.  I\'d like to think that it was her sense of good taste and high breeding (after all, she is dating me!)  that led her to choose the delightful mix of American wagyu, unagi, foie gras and other accoutrements and not the fact that it was by far the most expensive item on the menu at $25.\n\n"25 Dollars!" I mentally screamed to myself in shock and awe at the price tag of the appropriately named "Shogun".  "Well, two can play at that game" I told myself as I prepared to use my most persuasive tone normally reserved for dealing with irrational minorities and sleazy car salesmen.\n\nMe:  "Hey sweetie, great choice on the Shogun.  I was thinking, I\'m not really that hungry.  Maybe we should just share the burger and get an order of the oxtail fries.  I saw another table order them and they\'re so big."  *inwardly snickering at circumventing an astronomical bill*\n\nCorazon:  *small voice*  OK, we can do that...  but it\'s suuuuch a goood buuuurgerrrrr...  *heartfelt sigh along with sad eyes looking off into the distance a la Scarlett O\'Hara in Gone with the Wind*\n\nNeedless to say, dear readers, I ended up ordering a burger for myself and mi corazon happily partook in her Shogun burger.  To add further insult to the injury that I am a chumo that gets swayed by sad eyes and a cute face:  I would ask for nibbles of her delicious burger and she\'d purposely put her fingers really high up on the bun, effectively funneling my bites between her delicate fingers at 15-20% of normal bite capacity.  In response, I angrily accused her of culinary stinginess, but she responded with a heartfelt denial coupled again with sad eyes, and I just gave up the ghost...  $85, dear readers, for a couple of burgers and fries.  Still, I\'d like to think the look of sheer bliss on mi corazon\'s face was worth it.  \n\nTo also take the sting out of the bill, I made sure to hoard 80% of the delicious oxtail/aoili topping on the fries, as well scarfing down my 1500 calorie burger and a tall 22 oz bottle of Dogfish Head Pilsner.  And as we walked back to the car, ready to make the 280 mile trip back to LA, I tapped her on the shoulder, broke out my saddest eyes and asked her, "Sweetie, I\'m really tired.  Can you drive?" and hopped into the passenger seat and promptly fell asleep.\n\nBest $85 I ever spent.'

S"Bachi Burger is a great place for hamburgers. The flavors are tasty and distinctive.\nThe term gourmet hamburger is often over-used. I think anyone who aspires to make something better than a Big Mac will call it a gourmet burger. But the term really applies at Bachi Burger. It's first-rate ingredients prepared with great care, most with an Asian influence.\nI got the pickle plate appetizer, the mushroom cheeseburger, the salt-and-pepper fries and a soda they make in-house with cherry and some sort of Japanese fruit.\nAs soon as the pickle plate comes you know the owner is a friend of foodies. There's little bites of six separate things, all quite interesting. My two favorites were the daikon radish and the garlic.\nThe pepper in the salt-and0pepper fries are jalapenos. They're not too spicy. When the fries arrived they reminded me of a pepper-infused crab dish at Yummy Yummy in San Francisco. Interesting smells. And they tasted great. I got the pineapple ketchup o go with the fries but it didn't do much for me. The garlic aoili sauce was pretty good.\nThe burger was great. The black angus beef was first rate and perfectly seasoned and cooked. I loved all the different mushrooms they put on the burger. The gruyere cheese was tasty. And the bun was good, too.\nMaybe the only disappointment was the soda. I was hoping for something with some zingy acidity to match the rich foods, but it was a little flat. I wished I had tried a lime soda instead.\nBachi Burger is quite distinctive and certainly worth the trip south of The Strip., It's about 1.6 miles east of Interstate 15 at the Blue Diamond Road exit."

S"I remember driving by this joint a couple times before it opened and noticed the interesting name. Fortunately, that is enough incentive to get me to stop by.\n\nThis place definitely falls under the whole gourmet burger food trend that has come has popped up in the past couple years. I guess one could describe it as a Asian-American fusion restaurant. Most of their dishes have obvious Asian influences, from wasabi mayo, kim-chi toppings, to Japanese style BBQ sauce.\n\nEach item is served ala-carte, burgers (which range from $8-$13, with one or two premium ones in the $20+ range) do not come with fries though I definitely think ordering them is worth it.\n\nThe first time I went, I ordered a Kiki burger ($12) along with the Truffle fries ($3). The burger was excellent. The caramelized bacon melted in my mouth, and the unique lemon aioli that accompanies the burger really brought out some of the flavors of the meat. The fries were also good, thin cut fries topped with some a truffle reduction sauce. I would recommend sharing as a single order of fries is sufficient for two.\n\nBachi also offers traditional fare for less adventurous eaters. One can order a simple BBQ burger, or build their own from an assortment of their toppings. I recommend a tleast trying one of their specialties. \n\nLastly, the service was acceptable and the decor was minimalist. There are no booths in the restaurant, just tables which can seat 2 or 4. The idea of 'less is more' definitely works here as the restaurant does not seemed clutter at all. Instead, it comes off as stylish with their chilewich placemats and rotating artwork displayed on the walls. The server came around frequently enough to refill our drinks and ask if we needed anything else.\n\nIf your into burgers, I definitely recommend stopping by."

S'Went to Bachi Burger the other night in a group of 4. I have frequented this restaurant before and would give it 3 to 4 stars on those visit. This visit was different for the following reasons:\n\n1. We were put on a waiting list with our phone number so the hostess could call us. We returned to check on our spot and the hostess said she had just called our party. The hostess before did not communicate that they were using phone numbers. (must have been a shift change). Not a big deal by itself. We had good timing and did not lose our spot.\n\n2. Server did not introduce himself and was very cold and lacked any personality or genuine concern. While the service was not terrible it was definitely lacking. \n\n3. We were going to split 4 burgers. we requested that our burgers be cut in quarters so we could do this easily. The server told us her could bring us steak knives but they wont serve it cut. I asked another server and she said the same thing.\n\n4. We decided to do one less burger since we were not able to have the burgers cut to share. We decided it would be too much of a project to try to do at our table with steak knives. Two of the people in our party were going to split a burger and the other two would have there own.\n\n5. We asked if it was possible to get the burger that was being shared cut in half. It was a plain Jane burger and I was sure the kitchen could handle this. This resulted in a female staff member who I assume was a manager visiting my table to explain that they did not want to cut the burger because it would change the presentation(the cook wants the presentation his way) and the kitchen is really busy, "so in order to expedite the cooking process they would prefer not to cut the burger". This was a bit of an insult to anyone who has worked in the culinary world not to mention a paying guest.\n\n6. The manager took a uncompromising position as I did let her know this. The server hawked over our table the remainder of the visit, most likely to try to regain any lost tip (we still tipped 20%). \n\nIn summary, the food was good, but there are plenty of burger joints in the Las Vegas area, many of which I will visit more frequently in place of Bachi Burger. They are pricey as well in comparison to more established burger joints.\n\nThe customer service aspect and the arrogant manner in which the manager handled a simple request was what drove down this experience the most. My sister reminded me on this visit that she had previously come here and the chef refused to add lettuce to a burger because "it would change the taste profile of the food".\n\nAdvice to the chef: despite your enthusiasm for what YOU want, what YOU want comes second to what the GUEST wants. The guest is paying for a product as well as an experience. Without us, the GUESTS, YOU are out of a job.\n\nAdvice to the manager/supervisor: If you want to help the business grow as well as add to your professional success you will have a much easier road granting a special request rather than insulting your patrons intelligence by discussing logistics of a burger kitchen. In the time it took to give your enthusiastic lecture on expediting product from the kitchen, you might have been able to cut 20 or 30 burgers or maybe even grant a simple request to go above and beyond your current set of service standards. Instead we ordered one less burger on this visit, skipped desert and probably wont be back. YOUR JOB IS TO ENSURE GUEST SATISFACTION WHILE CREATING GUEST/BRAND LOYALTY. THE GUEST IS ALWAYS RIGHT. WITHOUT THEM YOU WOULD NOT HAVE A JOB.'

S"My wife and I stopped in not really knowing what to expect.  We were very pleasantly surprised. The menu had a wide variety of apps and burgers to choose from, so many of which sounded unique and promising we knew if we liked it we would have to come again. We ordered the steamed Pork Belly buns as apps and for burgers, the Ronin and Kiki. The buns were interesting, but just a bit better than okay. Glad we ordered it but no reason to get it again. To clarify i probably would order buns again, but a different variety. Now, on to the burgers...\n\nWOW!!! Both burgers (I tried my wife's Kiki) were amazing! I described it to my wife as an explosion in my mouth. Fireworks were going off... The burgers contained a melange of flavors and textures... I actually used the word melange for the first time in my life! It was an orgasm for the mouth. There was sweet and salty and spicy and juicy, crunchy, soft, and crisp...ohhhhh! Give me a moment, I will be okay. We also shared the Garlic Parmesan Truffle fries... Also wow. Strong and intense in flavor there was only so much one can eat in a sitting... as it strains the taste buds, but not in a bad way.\n\nI had Honeydew bobo tea, which was very nice as well, no worse or better than any I have had before, and the wife had the root beer. Since we filled up quickly we took the leftovers home... by 7 am my remaining burger which heated up well in the micro for 20 secs was gone, down the hatch! My wife finished hers cold. 'nuff said!"

Located in a strip mall off the beaten path this burger joint does something unique and special with the gourmet burger craze. The beef is Japanese as well as the interesting toppings. It's not cheap but it's also not going to leave you disappointed and still starving. The have different styles of flavored edamame that far exceed the typical steamed and salted you get everywhere else.

S'The first thing you should know when ordering a burger here - the word "BBQ" is used to describe how the meat is cooked. You won\'t find any barbecue sauce in their BBQ burgers (thank God).\n\nBBQ Bachi Burger American Wagyu - I ordered this badboy with a slice of cheese, a fried egg, and bacon. The burger was absolutely delicious. The whole thing was gone in a matter of a couple of minutes. The buns in the burger were identical to the BBQ Pork Bun (normally found in dim sum). For ~$9 the 7oz American Wagyu was definitely worth it.\n---4.5 / 5 Stars\n\nKiki\'s Burger - Good burger, all the flavors from the mushroom, bacon, and onion went well together.\n---4 / 5 Stars\n\nBachi\'s Chili Fried Chicken - Pricey for the small portions of chicken for this appetizer. However, the fried chicken w/ the garlic aioli went really well together.\n---4 / 5 Stars\n\nGarlic Salt & Pepper Fries - The texture of the fries were good, but the flavors were not. I was hoping for the fries to be a little bit more on the garlic side and I would have been okay with it on the pepper side as well, but it was neither. To sum it up it was just a little too salty and lacked garlic and pepper.\n---2.5 / 5 Stars\n\nTruffle Parmesean Fries - I was hoping for the fries to taste a lot like Fries w/ Truffle oil. Not even close and not worth mentioning. The sauce did not go well with the fries and I wouldn\'t recommend it.\n---2.25 / 5 Stars\n\nJasmine Green Milk Tea - Nothing close to some of the chain tea stations. I\'m not going to lower my review because of this drink, but I wouldn\'t recommend ordering it.\n--2.75 / 5 Stars\n\nEach additional topping on your burger will set you back $1.50. If you want extra sauce, they\'ll charge you an extra .50. My server did not warn me about this (for the sauce) and I had no idea until it showed up on the bill.'

S'I have been to Bachi Burger 5 times now and here is my take on it. This is definitely a nice place to go to for a unique tasting burger & appetizers. I mean that in a good way of course, however, the reason I am not giving this place 5 stars has nothing to do with menu items or cuisine, but rather the inconsistency of quality. It is quite obvious that they have one or two really good chefs that are phenomenal cooks, and all the others are pretty much bench players.\n\nNow, I don\'t know how many chefs they have but I came to this conclusion through logical reasoning, for I couldn\'t imagine their star chef having such an off day that they would produce "BBQ in the park with friends" quality food. So, the first 2 visits were great and then one bad, one good, and the last bad. It seems that on the busy days, like on a weekend, are the best times to go which were my first to visits. The other three visits were done through the weekdays, so if you go through the week my experience has been hit or miss (but as the record stands more miss during the week). Although, if you are interested in a boba tea just shy away, especially, if you ever been to any boba place on Spring Mountain (China Town) for you will be very disappointed.'

S"We ALWAYS take our visiting friends here, without fail. Asian fusion burgers never tasted better. I love their taro bun burger as well as the banh mi burger. My husband's go-to order is kiki's burger. Since we've started going there about a year ago, they've added a multitude of appetizers and desserts, probably due to the hours extension and additional bar. For the exotic beers they offer, I can see the draw in that. My family and I, however, have only eaten their for lunch or dinner. \n\nWe've never had bad service. Beware of wait times, though!"

S'I kept hesitating to come to this burger joint because from several people that has been here said they didnt like it.  So, I never would come here when Brad T. would suggest it until one day, Im like "what the hell, why not?"\n\n& Lo and behold!! I have fallen in love with this burger joint.  Was I imagining how great this burger (Miyagi-san\'s Grass Fed WagyuBurger) was! DELISH! We also ordered the:\nSalt & PepperGarlic French Fries & the Truffle ParmesanFries.  The truffle fries & you dip it into the sauce that goes with it.  It is absolute heaven, never tasted a fry that is so addicting (besides Mcds fries, lol) I can eat probably two orders of the truffle fries. \n\nThe service was superb, he was very friendly and recommended some things that we should try out next time we were there.\n\nThe ONLY reason why, I took away a star because I ordered Thai tea & coffee ice cream.  The thai tea was completely watered down, it tasted horrible. The coffee ice cream cost about $2.99 (I believe) it was soo tiny! \n\nHowever, I would definitely come back here but I probably would never order the thai tea or ice cream again.'

S'Call the health department about the raw food and fire Frank the manager!!!!!!  \n\nI went to Bachi Burger tonight on the recommendation of a friend.  I ordered a Kiki Burger medium rare.  I typically like hamburgers rare, but this was a burger in a restaurant, so I ordered it medium rare.  I was so hungry I was five bites in before I realized what I was eating....the burger was raw inside.  I asked my friend who was a chef to look too, and she confirmed that it was raw.   Not to mention, it was horribly sweet.  I would have ignored the bad taste, I was starving, but it was disgusting inside.  Raw and cold inside.  \n\nThe manager came over to check on us and I didn\'t want to say anything, but my husband piped up and said "her burger is rare, and she doesn\'t like it so she would like to order something else."  Rather than take the plate away and apologize, he started to argue with my husband.  He said "that is how we serve our burgers and if you don\'t like it, you should have ordered it another way."  My husband said "you are out of your mind if you think that is medium rare....where do you go from here if someone wants a rare burger?  You haven\'t left yourself any room to be more raw."\n\nSo, now I am uncomfortable.  I didn\'t want to say anything in the first place, but the manager did ask.  He took the plate away.\n\nHe came back, with the plate in his hand, and demanded my name.  He sort of stood there and asked as if he was going to write my name on the wall in the back.  I was speechless.  My husband told him his name and demanded to know why I was being asked.  The manager then said that he had had a discussion with another manager and they "were concerned that the burger had been half eaten."  I was shocked.  He started attacking me and demanding to know why I had eaten as much of the burger as I had if I "really didn\'t like it" and that under no circumstances would they refund any money!   \n\nMy husband and I are quite comfortable financially.  We have been fortunate enough to retire well and early and the last thing I would ever do is to try to scam half a hamburger from someone.  Moreover, we never asked to get anything for free.  Now, that doesn\'t mean I wouldn\'t expect a decent restaurant to offer.   I have sent food back maybe 5 times in my whole life, and each of those times I was offered free food and had to fight to pay for it anyway.  Most of the time it isn\'t their fault if I don\'t like something.  But, this was different....the food was raw.   Even still, we didn\'t ask for anything for free.   \n\nMy husband was so angry, as was my friend.  I just wanted to crawl under the table and die.  This manager is standing there yelling at me for something I haven\'t done.  We were ready to walk out, when the manager walked away.  It was only because of the waiter that we stayed.  He was so very kind.  \n\nThe manager then comes back a little while later and tries to apologize.  But, in doing so he makes the snarkiest little comment....he says he will take 25% off and he will give me the burger I sent back in a box to go.  The last thing I wanted was to ever see that burger again.  It was disgusting.  My husband said, if he wanted to take 25% off the check as an apology that might satisfy him.  But, boy was I miserable.  I have so far been fed terrible raw food, been yelled at for not liking it and then treated like a dog when I was told I should take that food home and eat it later..and why did they still have it?   \n\nWhen we were ready to go, I found out the manager had taken a lousy 2.50 off!  Turns out he meant he would take 25% off the price of the ten dollar disgusting burger, not the whole check as he should have.  I was vomiting in the bathroom at this time or I would have demanded that we pay the extra $2.50, I don\'t need his lousy money.  Oh, yes...I was vomiting in the restroom.  It is 5 hours later and I am still doubling over from cramps.  Was it the burger?  Either that, or the potato chips I had earlier in the day.  My bet is on the burger.  \n \nI should have taken that mealy burger to go so I could show it to the health department.  \n\nMy friend was so embarrassed that she had suggested the place, my husband was put in a miserable position, and I was in tears (at least on the inside, on the outside, I think I kept the tears from falling.)  Why did he ask my name?  Why did he tell me that it was my fault that I didn\'t know that medium rare meant raw inside to them?  Why did he assume I was trying to steal from him?  I am a size 8.  do I look like someone who tries to steal a half a hamburger?  Why did I eat that awful burger and have to have these awful cramps all night?  Oh why oh why did I ever go to Bachi burger????\n\n \nUpdate:  The owner was kind and after he heard about this said that Frank had been spoken to and he apologized deeply and said this is not the kind of service they expect...and he gave my friend a gift card and even waited on us when we retur'

I forgot what I ordered the first time, but for my second visit I got their special burger with baked scallop on top of the burger patty. that burger was like a surf and turf in a bun. I like that the scallops made the burger not as heavy. ahhh I wish they open one in LA area so I can go more often!"

I had the Kiki burger which was fantastic. My boyfriend got the Black and Green burger (wagyu beef, spinach, blue cheese, bacon)--also delicious. We also ordered the Parmesan Truffle Fries and the brussel sprouts---once again, amazing! The fries has a delicious cremini cream sauce drizzled over them and a great aioli for dipping.

S"I'm going to cut to the chase since many have written novels on how great this place is.\n\nThe restaurant is nicely decorated, and has enough space to feel comfortable.  The staff is friendly and can offer decent recommendations.  \n\nI ordered the Kiki's burger, truffle fries, and the Japanese tomatoes w/mozzarella appetizer.\n\nThe burger was delicious, definitely recommend if you like mushrooms.  The patty was cooked to perfection and the bacon added that last kick to make the burger perfect.  \n\nThe fries were definitely good but could have used more truffle sauce and I don't recommend getting the tomato appetizer unless you feel like spending some extra dough on a nicely presented unique appetizer.\n\nOnly downfall i would say is that you end up spending around 20 bucks on a burger with fries and drink, but that price sure beats burger bar."

S'I am always hesitant to drive somewhere to eat off of the beaten path when vacationing in Las Vegas because there are so many great places on the strip.  I was brought to Bachi Burger as a place we had to try, and the food did not disappoint.  \n\nMy first impression was that of skepticism since it is in a strip mall with not too much else around.  The looks of the place are pretty underwhelming when leaving the glamour and all the lights to the dusty roads of the dessert, but the food was definitely worthy of the visit.  I ordered the Kalbi burger, with no mayo, and fries. The burger had an excellent flavor that was on the sweet side. It actually tasted like what I thought it would judging by the picture and the ingredients.  It definitely satisfied my burger craving.  The fries were regular, but they came with pineapple ketchup.  That also tasted like what I hoped for.  It had a mild pineapple flavor that was not too overpowering.  It was a very tasty meal overall.\n\nI am never too keen on leaving the strip when visiting Las Vegas, but Bachi Burger was worth the drive.  There are a couple of burger places in Vegas that I prefer, but they have unique burgers and ingredients here that make it worth a visit.'

S"I decided to try this place after reading all the reviews, boy was i wrong!!\n\nI live in Orange County, was in town decided go out the way to this place instead of eating the overpriced food in the hotel.  Low and behold it's definitely overpriced for not so great food.  I'm not a food snob, but I'd like to think I know what great food tastes like. \n\nOxtail chili fries (what oxtail??) - can't taste the Oxtail and the chili itself is somewhat odd tasting left like a sour after taste. 2 stars \n\nDuck Steamed buns - nice presentation, but duck was cooked a bit rare and so tough that you can't even take a bite without pulling all the meats off.  I've had better...I told the server and he was nice enough to it take off the bill. 1 star\n\nMiso Burger - I thought it tasted pretty good, flavors all work together. 3.5 stars\n\nShogun Burger - Of course the server recommended this burger, it's the most expensive burger on the menu $25.  First off all if you don't know what Unagi is it's (eel) not everyone is familiar with the term.  My son who I think is a food snob wanted to try it, I only noticed it had Foie Gras.  Since it's illegal to eat Foie Gras in California, I thought we're in for a treat.  Let me tell you this burger combination is terrible...It has eel, Foie Gras, Pear, and beef, how does all this come together???!! Fish, beef, duck and pear in a bite is so weird and it left a fishy after taste, totally not what we expected.  \n\nAt the end the meal for 3 people cost $70 that's we 3 drinks and with the steamed duck buns taken off the bill.  \n\nI'll take the all you can eat buffet at the hotels anytime...sorry Bachi Burger you're overrated!"

S'Had my fair share of a few burgers here, and I will say, It\'s food that evokes a "wow" response and steady head nod of pleasant surprise and satisfaction. \n\nAlthough all their burgers are awesomely crafted and unique in their own respective category, my personal favorites to my taste would have to be both the Miyagi-Sans burger and the Black & Green burger.\n\nThe Miyagi-san is a grass fed wagyu burger with furikake, onion rings, caramelized bacon, fried egg and chili mayo. The flavors aren\'t overdone and easily craveable. As for the Black & Green, it\'s a grass fed waygu as well, with mushrooms, spinach, point reyes blue cheese (Medium/full flavored), roasted garlic and bacon. Very deep and rich without being too strong and overpowering. If you are a fan of blue cheese this burger does your fandom some righteous justice. Bonus is that their buns are fresh, sweet and made local! Mmm, respect.\n\nFor fries, I go for the Truffle Parmesan and if I have a partner to share with, the oxtail chili fries is the perfect plate with plenty to go around. for dessert, I have only had the chance to try their donuts. Covered in some quality cinnamon sugar and matched with a perfectly complimenting mocha ice cream. Although, tends to be a bit doughy and undercooked as I have come to find.\n\nService is service, nothing really outstanding or outlandish, but prompt and knowledgeable about their food. All in all I appreciate this place because the attention to quality and detail, and in that respect they put out some amazingly delicious and unique food.'

S'i really, really, really wanted to like this place and i did -- i just didn\'t love it. \n\nfirst of all, let me come correct about my prejudices. i think good food is 80% good product (what did TED WILLIAMS say about hitting ?? look for a good pitch and try and do something good with it). the rest is 15% good technique (if you\'ve seen the THOMAS KELLER video where he roasts a chicken, you know that that line blurs with genius but for us mere mortals ...) and 5% good recipes. \n\nBACHI BURGER works pretty darn hard at getting good product. they seem very conscientious about (locally) sourcing premium ingredients -- i mean LAS VEGAS is in the middle of the desert. i believe their recipes are stellar but their execution (at least the night we were there) is mediocre at best. \n\nother reviewers have complained about the service. ours was fairly attentive -- she did disappear toward the end of dinner and we had a bit of a time getting our check -- surprising because we came early (on a friday night) and by the time we were ready to leave the place was really filling up. but my biggest complaint was that she seemed bewildered by the menu and couldn\'t answer any of our questions and we had a few. \n\nthe menu was confusing -- for example the THAT\'s CHEESY burger under the specialty burger heading and just above the notation that all their burgers are 100% angus beef is a cheeseburger sans burger -- who knew ??? \n\nkid\'s GRILLED CHEESE was nasty -- no ifs, ands or buts. JULIANA and WYATT took one bite, made faces and pushed their plates aside. bad idea. bad execution. delete from menu offerings sooner than later.\n\nthe STEAMED BUNS (we had the short rib) were really interesting but a bit dry. love the idea. wish they offered a trio (duck and pork belly too) so we could have tried all three. horseradish-yuzu aioli was stiff and a surprisingly poor pairing with the beef. \n\nthe FRIES were limp. i\'m sorry but fries are supposed to be crisp. the dollop of black truffle "something" looked like my spuds had been strafed by sea gulls in a fly by. the flavors were amazing but ... \n\nthe seemingly endless array of little dipping bowls (house made ketchup and various aiolis) got confusing and nothing was soft and creamy -- mayos really shouldn\'t be hard and crusty -- should they? the flavors were amazing but ... \n\nwho decided grease spattered buns toasted on a grill next to the burger are a good idea ?? they\'re slippery and hard to hold on to and you have to wipe your fingers every single time you pick them up. mine fell apart about half way thru the sandwich and i had finish up with a fork. the flavors were amazing but .... \n\nhouse made sodas and the PORTUGUESE DOUGHNUTS and VIETNAMESE CINNAMON-COFFEE GELATO were fabulous -- no buts. well, would have preferred the gelato in one of those little bowls the aiolis come in so i wouldn\'t have had to chase it around my plate with a spoon but ...\n\nmy understanding is that at least one of the "BACHI" brothers was executive chief at ROY\'s -- your restaurant shouldn\'t be good. your restaurant should be great. \n\nyou\'ve already done the hard part. now get to work a little harder at doing the rest.'

I liked the simple decor with really awesome art on display.  Our server was a real sweet guy too.\n\nI got the Spicy Miso Burger (the special) and it was SOOOOOOOOOO tasty.  It was the best spicy burger I'd ever had.  It had a fried egg that was cooked to perfection. The sweetness of the creamy yolk went really well with the spiciness from the peppers and sauce.  The bun was soft, but crisp in between from the grill.  It's super messy, but all in the right ways.  This NEEDS to be permanent on the menu because I want to eat it every time!\n\nI also got the garlic, salt, and pepper french fries, which came with a spicy mayo sauce.  It was super good especially with the burger.  Very garlicy, but delicious.\n\nMy friend got the short rib steamed bun and I tried one (it came with three).  It was a great combo of flavor.  The meat was delicious and tender and the vegetables complimented the flavors.  The radish gave it a freshness that was just indescribable.\n\nShe also got the plain fries and I tried the sauce that came with it and was surprised.  The pineapple ketchup is surprisingly un-pineapple like.  It's sweet and a good compliment to the steamed buns.\n\nWe also got the Portuguese donuts dessert. It was sooooo good. The donuts are fried to order and go amazingly well with the icecream.  Together it tastes like a deconstructed fried icecream.  Really great.  I'll definitely order it again.\n\nGreat place...I'm going to try to go there again this week!"

S"Amazing burgers!  I love this place!  It was recommended by several friends, so I came here with my family, and it is possibly one of the best local burger joints in town.  Not to mention the homemade sodas.  Mmmmm!\n\nWe pigged out and order the kiki, fish, and kalbi burger along with sweet potato fries, truffle fries, Peking duck rolls, and finished off with Portuguese doughnuts.\n\nThe short review:\nGet the fish burger, sweet potato fries, and a Cherry Yuzu soda.  The fish is rich and just as good as a beef burger.  The sweetness in the fries pair off really well with the bitterness of the Cherry Yuzu.\n\nThe longer review: \nThe kalbi burger is really good, but also really sweet.  The first bites are tasty, but then my tongue got a little sick of the sweet meat.  Surprisingly, the kimchi on the burger wasn't overpowering.\n\nThe truffle fries are cooked just as well as the sweet potato fries: crispy yet fluffy.  The truffle gave it a richness that contrasted with the Parmesan shavings.  But, the truffle is only at the top, so everything under the first layer are regular fries.\n\nI wasn't too big on the doughnuts only because I am not a fan of cinnamon, and the accompanying ice cream for the doughnuts were loaded with cinnamon flecks.  Loaded!  \n\nThe atmosphere is really hipster.  The servers are young and relaxed.  The decoration is modern with an Asian theme, but still reminds me of a local coffee shop in Seattle.    \n\nOverall, the food focuses on contrasting flavors that complement which was done really well.  The quality is very high, and the atmosphere is awesome."

But as some of us know, "you dont put RLB in the corner," and im a lil claustrophobic, so she moved us to a bigger table and off the wall.\n\nThe waitress seemed to be new, maybe just had the training wheels taken off, but she was very polite and was able to answer our questions.\n\nI went with what has been dubbed "their plain burger."  I thought that the meat had a great flavor to it, but what threw it off was the sweet bun that it was on.\n\nThe salt & pepper garlic fries were GREAT!!!

I came back for another Bachi-style lunch on my most recent trip to Vegas, and every expectation was exceeded -- all thanks to a friend named Miyagi-San.\n\nWho exactly is Miyagi-San, you ask?\n\nOnly the BEST DAMN BURGER IN THE UNIVERSE.\n\nA perfectly cooked, grass-fed Wagyu beef patty.  Fried egg.  Caramelized bacon.  Onion rings.  Chili mayo.  These glorious ingredients are what you can find on the Miyagi-San burger.  They come arranged in a vertical tower of architectural splendor.\n\nThe Miyagi-San burger pairs perfectly with a plate of Bachi pickles.  The umami of the burger plays in perfect harmony with the sour tang of the vegetables.  Every bite is heaven.\n\nMeals like this are the stuff gastronomic dreams are made of.

S'A group of girls and I went to this place because someone went here in a past Vegas trip. It\'s a little ways away from the strip, but the trip was totally worth it. \n\nIt\'s an Asian take on the traditional burgers and fries, but in a tasteful and gourmet way! Small restaurant in a random plaza, but hey, no long wait. deserves it though, haha. \n\nWe ordered the salt and pepper garlic fries and the truffle Parmesan fries as an appetizer. SO good. he sauces that go with both of them really complement the fries well. the Salt and pepper is definitely my favorite, since it has more spice and kick with the jalapenos and the sauce. Two orders of fries fed 7 girls well, so it\'s pretty well portioned here.\n\nWhile many of my friends got Kiki\'s burger, and the Ronin, I got the Kalbi burger, mostly because of my love for kimchi. It\'s extremely tasty and ridiculously filling to the point of \'Oh my I\'m TOO full...but it\'s so good!" Kalbi ground  beef, kimchi, onions, a massive burger roll, and spicy cucumbers on the side. For someone who loves Korean Food, this definitely impressed me. \n\nThis is a pretty random place to go, especially when you surrounded by all this food on the main strip, but check this place out!'

S"I went to Bachi Burger because my co-workers were giving me a going away luncheon there. Service wasn't bad because we got there right when it opened. It started to get  busy after we left, so I can't say much after reading the other reviews about the wait.\n\nLooking around the place, it looked like a modern, asian burger restaurant. The menu had very interesting creations. I was indecisive in choosing what to get. I had the lonely bird & we all shared the truffle parmesan fries. The fries were good w/ the sauce.  My burger  wasn't the best. They were reasonably priced considering they were gourmet burgers. All the burgers looked very appealing as far as having a great presentation goes. The lonely bird is a turkey burger w/ a teriyaki flavor. I guess I wasn't too fond of what I ordered. I like turkey burgers, but this is the first time I had it w/ an asian twist. I decided to try it just in case it was good. You never know, but at least I know now that turkey burger w/ teriyaki flavoring is not for me.  \n\nOne of my friends let me try her burger. I think it was called the black & blue. It was good. My bartender ordered the Crusty Crab & devoured it in like a couple mins. He said it was good & he would come back again. Everyone else had the Ronin & Kiki's burger. They all seemed to be enjoying the meal. I was enjoying the meal because I had great company. It was nice that they let us take group photos in there. \n\nI thought it was cool that they had many different flavored & unique beverages. I had the Jasmine lemonade tea. It was rather refreshing. Everyone seemed to like the lychee tea. \n\nThe one thing I really didn't like about the establishment was when I had to use the restroom, their sink wasn't working. There was no water coming out. Hopefully they fixed this problem because it's a shame to be eating a meal w/ your hands & not be able to wash them prior to or after the meal. \n\nI would come again because their menu is unique, but maybe I'll wash my hands before arriving the establishment & bring extra sanitizing wipes."

S'Holy sweet Jesus, this is some good cow.\n\nThey proudly display a sign that says "Voted Best Gourmet Burger in Vegas 2010"---and rightfully so.  Bachi Burger takes the classic "meat, bun, & veggie combination," adds a bit of an Asian twist to it, sprinkles on some magic dust, and voila! What you have is a kickass burger waiting for you to devour it.\n\nWith every Vegas trip I go on, I\'ve been more than glad to come back here. Service has always been amazing--almost as amazing are their Sweet Potato Fries. Semi sweet, super crispy, extra delicious. Get these instead of the gravy-topped Truffle Fries and you won\'t be disappointed.\n\nIt\'s not listed on their current menu, but last time I went, I had the pleasure of trying an appetizer dish...I believe it was Seared Tuna with Chips....it was utterly delicious. The salty chips paired nicely with the silky fish. The Ronin Burger, Kiki Burger, and Spicy Miso are always good choices as the main course.\n\nNext time (if the blackjack tables treat me a little better,) I\'ll opt for the Shogun Burger!'

S"Love the passion fruit boba and the sweet potato fries were crispy deliciousness! I didn't like the mustard sauce that came with it so much but they were yummy just plain. My shogun burger was disappointing because the patty was overcooked but the foie gras slab was generous and delicious. They offered to redo my burger but I didn't want them to have to redo a $25 burger so I declined. Later, since I couldn't eat the meat, I wish I had taken them up on their offer. Service is kind of spotty but the facility itself is hip and clean. Worth a try for sure!"

S"If I lived around the area, I'd probably be here very often and probably very heavy but YOLO (is that still the catchphrase of the day? lol).  We ordered:\n\nMiyagi-San burger:  This was pretty good! It has bacon, fried egg, onion rings, chili mayo and furikake (which is apparently a seasoning..thanks, Google).  After staring at pictures, this is one of the burgers you must try.\n\nRonin burger:  This burger has Japanese cole slaw in it which I've noticed was just added slices of that red ginger you get when you eat at Japanese restaurants.  There's also caramelized onions, fried egg, yuzu citrus aioli, katsu bbq and miso goma dressing.  I've only tried this and the previously mentioned burger but this one was my favorite.  Actually, we both liked this one the best.  If you're generally not a fan of ginger (like moi), you will hardly taste it and you'll survive.\n\nSalt & Pepper Garlic fries:  I asked for recommendations on the fries and was told to get this one since it was the waitress's favorite.  It has jalapeno, sea salt/pepper and surprisingly more ginger than I was expecting, which didn't make it that great for me.  Get this if you are, again, a fan of ginger.  We couldn't really taste anything garlicky about the fries (and the sauce as well), but more of the jalapeno.  It comes with an amazing garlic chili aioli sauce.\n\nTruffle Parmesan fries:  We really liked this one the best (compared to the other fries).  There's black truffle porcini cream on the fries along with a sun dried tomato aioli.  I think we liked these fries mixed with the garlic chili aioli  together.\n\nMilk tea drinks:  These were THE most bland drinks we have ever had with its non-sweet flavors (honeydew and lychee) and too soft tapiocas.  \n\nFor drinks, I was told that they do make their own beverages and I did see this one soda that seemed appealing (apple and lychee).  Other than that, we look forward to our next Vegas trip and we'll definitely be back!"

S'Whenever you hear about "high end" burger joints you always have to wonder what and how they are going to be. Usually I think of In-n-Out or maybe Five Guys for a good burger, but now you can go and get a restaurant style burger for like $10-15. Bachi Burger is a joint like that where they throw the asian flair onto their burger in a fusion manner. I was a bit skeptical when I saw some of the items on the menu but when you try them out the flavor combinations turn out to be very good.\n\nFirst we started with the oxtail chili fries - now for me oxtail is one of the best things ever, and when you combine it into a chili and then top it on top of fries with a sunny side up egg, you got a winner. It is definitely enough to share as an appetizer - we did for 4 people - and everyone got a taste of the flavor explosion.\n\nNow there are way too many burgers to choose from, so our group of 4 decided to pick 4 different burgers so that we could all taste a little of each one.  We sampled the Ronin, Kalbi Burger, Spicy Miso Burger, and the Crab burger. We got all of the burgers medium rare (which is much better than the recommended medium) as the quality of the meat was actually very good. Overall, every burger had its own unique flavor combination and each of them I would have been happy with getting, but I was glad to share and try each one of them out. The Ronin had a japanese flavor to it, the kalbi as its name implies, had kimchi in the burger and actually went very well with the meat. The spicy miso was also very good and as I am a fan of shishito peppers chose this burger - it definitely was not "spicy" as the name implies and could have used something to give it more of a kick. The special burger of the night was the crab burger that added a crabcake on top of the burger which in itself was quite delicious.\n\nOverall, a very good "high-end" burger restaurant and I would like to go back and try some of their other flavors of burgers.'

S'My wife and I tried out this place when it first open.  I have to say, I am glad I waited awhile before I posted a review.  The first couple of times we went into the establishment we had horrible service.  Our first visit had us had us waiting over 45 minutes just to be asked what we wanted to drink!  My wife and I both felt it would be unfair to judge the place bast on customer service and not have tried their food, and I am glad we did.  The service had greatly improved ,and their burgers are excellent.  I have tried almost every burger on the menu without a negative experience.  Their sweet potato fries and truffle fires are amazing. Their sake is also very good and served in some rather interesting carafe styles..  The one down side to this place is that it can be expensive, and everything is A LA carte.  All in all this place is a good place for my wife and I do go with friends to have a good atmosphere and excellent food.'

S'First off let me say that they have a remarkable parking lot, which is where we waited for about 40 mins to get seated, the anticipation I had was that of waiting for a ride at Disneyland, I was mildly disappointed. By the way it looks like a starbu&* convention in the parking lot with the fancy cars and the few overdressed people looking to flex their culinary lack of taste or perhaps they are just herd follower\'s I don\'t know, didn\'t ask either way there is a slightly pretentious feeling in the air there.\n  \nOk, on to the table and food, let it be known that their service is EXCELLENT!, their server\'s are great, even if the flamboyant gentleman did forget my saracha hot sauce lol. They were quick almost instantaneous with the pre dinner drinks, which came out almost as if they had somebody behind the corner who already knew what we wanted, appetizers took about 10 mins, and they would have been worth a 20 minute wait, all of our guests reported they loved the appetizers, in fact one said he would just forget the burger and order the chicken appies and the fries for pick-up and head home, they were that good. NO compaints there at all. * I cant express how great our waiter was, and their staff even tho he did forget my hot sauce request*  They give SUPERIOR customer service.\n \n  About 15 mins or so after the appies came out our main course ala burgers arrived, in all their pretentious arrogant glory lol, with their glossy buns and spike stabbed thru the middle, initially I thought "so this is what those perfectly presented and prepared commercial burgers look like in real life", they looked like Hollywood props, very shiny, looking it over I had to chuckle lol, I ordered it well and it was cooked perfectly once again, if anything they are consistent here, the burger was too sweet for my tastes, it didn\'t deliver the punch to the palate that I was expecting but it was very OK, nothing stood out at me or there was nothing singular ingredient wise I could say I liked about this particular burger, you know eh, it was ok, it looks way better than it tastes. I cant honestly give a superb recommendation for this place because it just wasn\'t worth the price, its a 6 dollar burger at best with a 15 dollar presentation. Yes it does look great, but for all that flash it needs more bite. I\'ve had better at local pubs for way less. The truffle fries were on a 1-10 scale a solid 8, very tasty as was their chili fries. \n   \nMaybe its the hipster crowd herd following thing that makes this place appear better than it really is, or I guess people just have mediocre taste buds but Bachi burger didn\'t do it for me, cant say that I will return unless its for appetizers to go....\n Get out there and eat Vegas , explore and report =) be well.'

The burgers were all cooked well and the asian twist behind everything was surprisingly amazing. Some of the burgers I tried were the Banh Mi, the Kalbi, and the Kiki. The Kalbi was by far my favorite out of the three, it has kimchi which was a great substitution to lettuce.We also ordered their oxtail chili cheese fries, the Bachi pickles, sweet potato fries and their salt and pepper garlic  french fries. The oxtail fries was the only thing that I wouldn't order again. Everything else was delicious, you have to try the salt and pepper garlic fries, I couldn't stop eating them.\n\nOverall this place is worth the trip if you're a local. If your a tourist and want to venture into some of the local eateries this place will fulfill your need."

I had the Ronin burger and my wife had the Kiki's burger. We also had the truffle parmesan fries which were quite good. My wife wasn't as impressed as I was. She didn't really like the taste of her burger, maybe she is too used to the American burger taste. But I absolutely loved my burger. It was moist and juicy and the bun was very good. The service was friendly and because it was our first time there, we even got a bowl of shrimp chips on the house. But we were too full to thoroughly enjoy it. They have quite a few other burgers that I am interested in trying. Next time....."

A little extra crunchy and crispy than I would have wanted (We mistakenly thought it would be more crab cakey), but a solid choice if you aren't craving beef.\n\nAgain, if you come here, you gotta try the Oxtail fries.  It is true oxtail, and super delicious and tender.\n\nThis is the best Asian fusion style burger in town.\n\nWe will be back again!"

Service both times we've been here however was lacking in sincerity and in execution. We ordered for desert the chocolate/peanut butter Souflee which takes 20 minutes to come out. When that desert came out out other desert hadn't came out yet. Another 15 minutes passed and still no second desert ( Portugese donuts and gelato). When I brought this to their attention and said I no longer wanted the desert then 2 minutes later it came out. I was so upset at that and that there was no apology or explanation so i just payed my bill and left."

S'I went to this joint back in feb 2014 and was the first of several highly-anticipated-first-timers.  Rumor has it the place was feature on "diners, drive-in, n dives" (I\'m sure I got the name of the show with Guy F. wrong)... I will only review what my hubby and I had and experienced.\nService - 5/5. since we were one of the early arrivers: ordered, ate, and paid the tab all within 45 min\nFries with truffle and aioli sauce - 5/5. damn, it\'s good and fresh off the fryer.\nSweet bun with roast duck and sauce - 4/5. it was only good.  I had better at authentic Chinese restaurants.\nShogun burger (my other half\'s breakfast of the day) - 10/5. YES, 10/5!!! IT WAS THAT DAMN GOOD.  I was only lucky to stole a bite out of the shogun while my hubby was bz with his phone researching our next destination of the day. The $25 shogun is worth every penny! It is worth a trip back to this place just for the burger. \nVietnamese ice coffee - 4/5. Usually when I\'m hungry, everything should be better, but this didn\'t do it.\n\nOverall, because of the shogun burger and the estimated mean, I gave it all the stars it deserve.  If the joint opens one up in northern Cali with the same or higher standard, I would never dine there, instead I will quit my job so I can work there as many days as I can to eat the mouth watering burger daily;'

S'EDIT: The manager of Bachi Burger contacted me with his concerns, and since I\'ve had both HORRIBLE experiences with backlash for negative reviews, and decent ones, I MUST add this to my review: ***Because of how professionally it was handled and how polite the message was, if I was back in this area, I would likely give this place another try and just order different things. Management with excellent customer service skills? Good job.\n\nWow... I can\'t express the disappointment that myself and my friends experienced at this place. It should also be stated that I KNEW I was walking into a fusion restaurant, and I was expecting a different take on burgers - but I wasn\'t expecting a sugar rush or an upset too-much-sweets stomach from a burger for lunch.\n\nWe arrived for lunch, having driven quite a ways away from the strip (which is FINE if you want to drive; we didn\'t mind at the time. But if you\'re looking for a good burger and you\'re visiting Las Vegas, staying on the strip? Just eat somewhere down there, really), and we were starving. This place busy, but not full; having said that, it took quite a bit of time to get seated in comparison to other restaurants that were just as busy during our trip, and yet seated us sooner. When we were seated, it then took quite a while for someone to pay attention to us long enough to take our order - they seemed very impatient and annoyed with questions about the menu, or any of the three of us being indecisive. They were very much non-engaging, as well, if that makes sense - it didn\'t feel as though they gave a hoot whatsoever that we were there, spending our money at their business.\n\nThe items that we all settled on:\nPeking Style Duck Steamed Buns - These were the only thing I really liked about the meal. They were a new, interesting version of steamed buns; since I\'m in LOVE with steamed buns and any form of dim sum, I liked the different take on this dish.\n\nSpicy Miso Burger\n\nBlack and Green Burger\n\nKiki\'s Burger - this is what I ordered. I can honestly say that, along with the other people at my table, all I remember was how OVER POWERINGLY SWEET THIS THING WAS. Seriously. Sure, it was juicy and tender meat, but you couldn\'t even taste the meat itself because it was drenched in whatever marinade/sauce they use. For being told this was THE place to go for excellent burgers, I must say... not so excellent, unless you want a sugar high and have no interest in the burger itself. HOWEVER, the burger buns were divine and fluffy. Very nice touch, but would have been a nicer touch on a burger worth eating. If their quality of meat is sooooo great and wonderful, then they shouldn\'t hose them down with so much sauce that they kill the flavor of such "quality" meat.\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries - these were so unimpressive. It tasted like they took powdered brown mushroom gravy out of a packet, is the comment my partner said. On top of that, the overly sweetened mush burgers were enough food to have just skipped the fries altogether.\n\nTaro boba was bland, I\'ve definitely had better for a lesser price; my partner remarked that the thai tea was kind of dull, too.\n\nWe had a few other things, but I don\'t recall EVERYTHING that was on our table... none of it was good enough to really remember, except for the neat steamed "buns" and how fluffy the burger buns were.\n\nIn the end, our incredibly disappointing experience came out to $70-ish, and it should have been under $50 for what we felt we got out of it. The whole place seemed pretentious and snooty, especially for a restaurant specializing in burgers. The attitude (or lack of one, since they hardly cared to pay attention to us) of the service, the ridiculous marinade/sauced burger patties, and the overall disappointment is NOT worth recommending this place to others - at least, not from my point of view.\n\nTo top it all off, we had reservations at a restaurant that night that we were all very excited for, but within 20 minutes of leaving, two out of three stomachs were so soured from the sugar burgers that we had to cancel our dinner plans, and actually just return to our hotel rooms for a nap!'

S"This is our first Triple Ds joint and it did not disappoint. Great food and good service. Oxtail chili cheese fries- sweet, and savory oxtail goes really well with the crunchy texture of the fries.  Grilled Kurobuta & Arabiki Sausage- it was just ok. Pork Belly Steamed Buns- although pretty fatty looking but it just melts in your mouth, the hoisin dipping sauce is too salty for my taste, should be more on a sweeter side. The Miyagi-san's Grass-Fed Wagyu Burger- very good, soft and light sweet buns compliments the burger perfectly. Shogun burger- a monster burger with foie gras, unagi, and pear. \nOverall a very good restaurant, will definitely come back to try their other stuff on their menu."

S'Wow. I\'m so glad I saw this place on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. It is delicious! The burgers are piled high with really quality ingredients, but be prepared to wait. Ever since this place has been on tv, people flock to it. Also, if you\'re staying on the LV strip, taking a cab here will cost you about $20.\n\nWe started with the Chili Fried Chicken. It was perfectly fried, without too much excess batter, and the sauce was spicy, salty, and a little sweet. You could definitely taste the garlic. The cabbage that came with our appetizer also gave it some good texture to contrast the relatively soft chicken. Two thumbs up.\n\nI ordered Kiki\'s burger, and my fiance ordered the "Banh-Mi" burger with a fried egg on top. When we saw everyone else\'s burgers come out, we assumed we\'d be full after an appetizer and a burger. We were right. Anyway, the Kiki\'s burger melted in my mouth, and I really enjoyed a new take on a bacon-mushroom cheesburger. My fiance\'s Banh-Mi burger was so interesting! You could actually taste the shrimp in the patty, which also contained beef and pork. The herbs and pickled vegetables were tasty, but be careful, because the aioli and the sauce together can get very spicy. \n\nOur waitress was very friendly, as was the young man who refilled our waters. They each said, "please, thank you, yes ma\'am, yes sir, etc.," and they were very helpful anytime we had a question about the menu. Overall, a great place to eat.'

Our table was set-up, but somehow it took another 10 minutes to seat us.  It was 20 minutes from ordering to getting our food.  However, once we were finished, they were in a big hurry to clear our plates.\n\nFood Review:\nRonin Burger - quality meat and tasty bun, overalll good flavor\nKalbi Burger - a burger with Korean flavorings, we found the kimchi to be too sweet \nOx Tail Chili Fries - little ox tail, IMO, not worth $11\nVietnamese Coffee - watererd down, not really Vietnamense style\nSweet Potato Fries - crispy and tasty-- a hit at our table\nParmesian Truffle Fries - fries were tasty, although most in our group didn't care for the gravy\nCaesar Salad- a little too cheesy for us\n\nFor $20/person including tip, it's pretty steep for what you get.

S"My review is more like 4.75 stars, but I loved this place.  At first glance, this place didn't look like much.  Wow, was I wrong.  The hostess greeted us and we were seated immediately.  This place is small and kind of unpretentious (yay!).  If it were closer to my house, I would go here all the time.  My BF and I met an out-of-town friend here for dinner, as she was shopping at the nearby outlet mall.  Since we don't live that close, we decided to try EVERYTHING.\n\nWe started off with the Momato appetizer (Japanese tomatoes with balsamic and fresh cheese).  I think I remember seeing in a review that these weren't worth your time.  I wholeheartedly disagree.  These tomatoes were the perfect flavor without a hint of bitterness.  The ratio of each ingredient was perfect too.  Loved it.  We also had cold edamame beans which were just okay.\n\nMy BF ordered the Ronin Burger.  My friend and I ordered the Kiki Burger.  My burger was soooo good.  Cooked perfectly and great flavors.  My BF tried mine and swears his was even better, but since I didn't get a bite before he woofed it down, I wouldn't know.  \n\nAs for the fries, we split an order of the Truflle fries and the garlic and salt fries.  I loved the garlic fries, truffle fries weren't my bag, but the other two enjoyed them. \n\nSomehow, after eating all that food, we decided to order two desserts: strawberry beignets (basically crunchy strawberry filled donuts) and peach poptarts.  Don't bother.   Both desserts were mediocre and definitely the weakest link in this otherwise awesome dinner.  Even though this is out of the way for me, I will definitely be going back.  Our server (whose name has escaped me, mostly because he looked and sounded like Keanu Reeves and even said he was from Hawaii, but I'm sure his name is not Keanu) was great as well.  You could tell he was really trying and was very attentive.  And did I mention the prices????  All that food plus a Sapporo and our bill was $60!!!

Two pieces of pork in the soul and it was good but it was all fat.\n\nAlso ordered a burger ($15) (forgot the name) but it had onion rings and a sunny side egg in it an it was delicious! The patty is so soft and full of flavor.\n\nThe waitress forgot our oxtail fries but that's okay because we were stuffed. \n\nGiant burgers can definitely share between two people with an appetizer.

S"The short version: spectacular food, reasonable prices, average (at best) service that just isn't the fault of the servers. The managers and/or owners are waaaaaaaaay understaffing their floor at peak times and it hurts the experience, which would be perfect if not for the service issues.\n\nWe started with the pickled vegetables -- revelation. A nice mix of Japanese veggies that calmed the appetite but didn't fill us up. I've had both the Ronin with beef and with the chicken patty (for reduced guilt.) I loved it with both, awesome flavor combo. The fries are special. Truffle parmesan is spectacular, sweet potato not far behind.\n\nBeware the hard sell on the drink menu, both alcoholic and non. Looks like that's where they make up for the reasonable prices on the food menu. If you want a drink, there's a great selection of sodas, beers, wines, etc., but it'll run up your bill in a hurry.\n\nServers are friendly and helpful, but just stressed out by being stretched too thin. There were two for the entire floor at dinner a few weeks ago and they were running for their lives. For the sake of the experience, please staff up, Bachi!"

S"Joel wanted a burger for lunch and I just wanted lunch. We finally agreed on Bachi Burger.\nSince it was lunch time it was pretty packed. We only waited about 5 minutes and we were seated. This was our first time here and I noticed they merged with the ramen restaurant next door. Very cool! We looked over the menu and I immediately saw they offered bao sandwiches!! They offered my favorite kind too! The peaking duck bao. Joel ordered Kiki's burger and we shared the truffle parmesan fries. \n\nThe fries came out first! They were thin cut, crispy and came drizzled with truffle sauce  over them. I also ordered a side of garlic chili sauce to dip them in. Yum! Next came Joel's burger and my duck bao. Joel's burger was messy!!! It had lots of shiitake mushrooms, a slice of gruyere cheese and a thick juice burger patty. By the time he finished I felt like I needed to hose him down he was so covered in burger and sauce. My bao was tender and the meat was flavorful. It also had a thin slice of egg and radish and came with a side of hoisn sauce. That complimented the bao nicely. \n\nThe service was prompt and friendly. I always love when places pay attention and refill my water glass when empty. The Bachi Burger staff fit the bill. The waiter even quickly brought napkins when Joel was messy. \n\nThe decor is basic. The wooden benches and chairs are not comfy. They also have a bar you can sit at, but those high chairs didn't look any more comfy. \n\nI think it's great the Bachi has merged with the next door ramen spot. It lets them offer more options and a larger dining place. On the price it is a little expensive. ($3 for a soda. I'll stick with water.) \n\nBachi Burger was tasty, but I can't say I'd go out of my way to go back anytime soon."

This places does get pack during the weekend, but the wait usually isn't that long. I only got the Oxtail chili cheese fries since I was not hungry at the time. I tasted some of my friends orders and it was pretty good. I can't say much about this place since I didn't get to really try the food as much as I wanted to, but I will update my review it once I head back to Vegas."

S'Mouth watering burgers cooked to perfection. I had the Miyagi sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger. The egg yolk dripping down the side of my burger was the finishing touch to this flavorful masterpiece. The parmesan cheese fries on the other hand, were anything but amazing. Had I known they were going to be lacking in flavor, I would have ordered them original with a side of ketchup. The waitress was attentive and not in the fill your glass of water every 5 seconds kind of way... We all know how annoying that can be!\nI will definitely go back as soon as I can. I will continue experimenting with all the different burgers in search for the best one. Any place that makes eating a "burger" an amazing experience is my kind of place. Be prepared to unbutton your jeans/pants when exiting this establishment.'

S'One of the most reviewed and highest places to eat in Vegas, OFF the strip count me in!\nIt was pretty busy for dinner, but we got a great table just a few minutes later.\nService was nice, though they were busy, they got our order right and food came out quickly,\nThe menu is very different from any other burger place, takes a while to take it in and narrow down the selection.\nFor starters we had the chili fried chicken LOVE, so crispy, sweet and spicy, perfect!\nOnion rings and salt and pepper garlic fries, also excellent, piping hot and crunchy with great flavors, win!\nKids meal, a great value at $9, full sized burger, fries and a side of fruit and veggies, score!\nI had the Caesar with Baby Romaine, Avocado, Tomato, Parmesan Reggiano, Organic Jidori Chicken Breast and Spanish Anchovy \nNot a fan, basically a plate of cheese, killed the lightness and all other flavors, cold chicken and I tried my way through all of their dressings, liked none and just didn\'t eat the salad, no bueno.\nMuch better was the No meat here burger with Wheat ,Red Bean, Shiitake Mushroom Patty, Japanese Eggplant , Mixed Greens, Tofu, Chili Lime Vinaigrette\nBasically 3 veggie burgers in one.\nThe breaded eggplant I can do without, but that Mushroom patty was AMAZING!\nThere was so much going on, so many flavors, so many taste buds that had never been tickled like that!\nMy husband had the The "Banh-Mi" Burger with Angus Beef, Pork, Shrimp, Lemongrass Pork Pate. Fresh Herbs, Curry Aioli Pickled Vegetables, Nuoc Mam Sauce and liked it though, all the different meats in one burger got to him after awhile. \nPortions are not huge, but the flavors are so intense, that everything is served in perfect proportion.\nCan\'t wait to be back, something to look forward to next time I am in Vegas!'

S"Was recommended to try this place by a friend of mine who is a local.  This place is outstanding!  I'll be coming back here again in the future.\n\nHaving choices of Wagyu beef for my burger was something I haven't seen since Mastros in Beverly Hills.  I'm starting to notice a trend of people using this more often than Kobe Beef.\n\nI had the Miyagi-san burger.  The buns are soft and buttery, the tempura onions were amazing and the egg adds to the flavor presentation.  Side order of Salt and Pepper Garlic Fries and my vice... Thai Tea.\n\nI like that they offer the option of adding a patty to their burgers.  While it would be impossible to fit it in your mouth with the leaning tower of ingredients found on this burger, I'm sure that for someone like me who is a protein hog would take advantage of it."

Compared to the competition of gourmet burgers out there this place is very very reasonably priced. Everything is always cooked perfectly with a nice crust on the patties and perfectly medium on the inside. I highly recommend the miyagi San, it is out of this world. I come here at least 2 times a month and never get sick of it, every one of my out of town friends have said its the best burger they've ever had. Can't recommend or enough"

S"This place is as trendy and hipster as a burger place can get. For wait times, I usually come in on weekend nights and I'm almost immediately seated.\n\nThe waiters are top notch, they have good knowledge of their food, what's the best selling, refills on water, and the normal checking up.\n\nI usually order the ronin burger. It has angus beef, caramelized onions, japanese cole slaw, mis goma dressing, fried egg, katsu bbq, and yuzu citrus aioli aka just a bomb selection of ingredients. I've tried most of their menu but I feel like this is probably one of the best ones. Taking a bite out it the  yolk immediately oozes out and creates a secondary spreading on the burger making it even more juicy ^^. . This burger was definitely a 5/5.\n\nAnd with any of their orders I always get their truffle parmesan fries, it is always consistent and I never had a bad batch of fries from them. Fries are also a 5/5. Not too greasy, and has the right amount of parmesan.\n\nIf I could change anything about the food is I wish they could give more sauce! It last only half the meal, and the charge for more :/ .\n \nIf you're anywhere in Vegas, I definitely recommend this place!"

S'Unfortunately I was completely unimpressed by Bachi Burger.  In fact, I truly regretted wasting precious room for calories and fat on Bachi Burger and wish I had went over to Miko\'s instead and gorged on sushi and deep fried rolls.\n\nTo start off, the bf Landon L. and I stopped in around 10p on a Sunday night and the place smelled horrible.  I realize that parts of Las Vegas have this disgusting smell and if you happen to be the unfortunate restaurant, I feel badly for you.  However, I cannot help but have to include into the overall experience. \n\nWe asked to seated outside but they weren\'t serving outside for some reason so we sat at a table close to the back.  This helped a lot with the smell.  Apparently, whatever it was was confined mainly to the front of the restaurant.\n\nThe service was very friendly but slow.  It felt like forever waiting for our burgers.  We ordered the Miyagi sans Grass Fed Wagyu Burger, the black & green burger, and Truffle Parmesan Fries, all of it quite boring and unimpressive and over priced for what you get.  Don\'t get me wrong, I am more than happy to pay a lot of money for good food.  For example, $19 for the Buffalo Burger at Burger Bar?!  HELL YES. Any day!! Worth every penny.\n\nI felt that the burgers at Bachi lacked flavor and punch.  They try to make them complex and "fusiony" but the ingredients were incohesive.  First, the Miyagi came with a fried egg, which was overcooked.  I guess when I order a burger with a fried egg, I expect the yoke to have some sort of runniness.  The black and green was okay, but really sweet.  And the Truffle Parmesan Fries were just okay as well.  We also ordered 2 beers.  All of this came to $45.  I would rather have given my $45 to Five Guys or In and Out.\n\nI\'m sorry but though the food is okay, I think everything about the menu is pretentious and the price tags are way too high.'

S"Call it Ono Burger instead of Bachi Burger because their Hawaiian-style burgers are so, so good.\n\nEver since Manapua Man closed shop about five years ago, I've been missing my favorite, chubby little hand held snack. Now it's back, split in two, double the price, and served with high-class condiments. Bachi's steamed buns with kalbi short ribs, cilantro and aioli is like gourmet Manapua. For $9, they didn't quite fill me up, so I suggest you go Hawaiian style: convince your buddy that she wants fries, soda, and dessert, then start bummin.'\n\nThe homemade sodas ($3.50) are the best I've ever had. Bachi also offers a small but delicious selection of beers--Rogue Hazelnut Brown being one of them (thanks Joe W.).\n\nI highly recommend the Kiki Burger and the steamed bun dishes. I wouldn't waste stomach space or expense on the fries--just bum them from a friend."

S'Service: 3\nFood: after having it the first time I rated it a 5. Now after the second time it\'s 3.5-4 \n\nWe came here on a sat night knowing there will be a wait. We put our names down and was told that for a party of 5 it\'s going to be 30-45 min wait. Exactly 30 mins later we checked back in and it seems like they have already crossed our names out (we weren\'t waiting outside of the restaurant we walked around).  We were told that unfortunately they would have to rewrite our names on the bottom of their list again since we left the area. I personally have never heard of that rule or ever been to any restaurant that practices that so I tried reasoning with the hostess. Long story short turns out that they could "make something happen" and that there\'s another party just leaving and we will get seated right after. Our waitress was really nice and did a good job at recommending different menu items but she didn\'t check back in with us very often to see how things are going and if we needed anything. \n\nI remembered the burgers being amazing the first time I tried them. However this time not so much, my burger tasted a lot more saltier than I remembered and to my liking. We got the truffle fries and a side of pineapple ketchup. I mean I LOVE pineapple so I just HAD to try it. It taste just like ketchup that\'s a little on the sweeter side but other than that I don\'t taste anything different. I\'m guessing it\'s just ketchup mixed with pineapple juice but who knows! I got the "banh mi" burger and the bf got the Ronin Burger. Banh mi burger...like I mentioned was pretty salty, but I think that might be because the pickled carrot was not made correctly. I tasted the carrot on its own and it was extreme salty and nasty so I had to take it out of my burger. Other than that little hiccup..everything was wonderful. The bf loved his burger I mean you can\'t go wrong with a juicy patty and fried egg! OH did I mention their flavored soda is ammmaazzingggg! I\'ve tried the apple lychee, the peach one, as well as orange tangerine and every single one is great!  \n\nOverall experience was great. Def will be back again.'

S"Bachi = short for Hibachi = Grill\n\nMy friends kept raving about this place and telling me to try it, so I went here on my recent trip to Vegas. I got here late in the afternoon at around 3 PM, and the wait was about 20 minutes. I think that's pretty good considering the other reviews I've read. \n\nWe ordered the truffle parmesan fries, Wagyu burger, and the Kiki burger. The truffle parmesan fries were ok. I'm not too sure I liked the truffle sauce that much. It tasted very similar to Asian cafe mushroom sauce to me, but a little saltier and tangier. I think I would have enjoyed the fries more if it had just parmesan on it. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our burgers, I noticed the staff was in disarray. I saw way too many employees in the restaurant, and all of them were running around looking frazzled. The guests sitting at the table next to me were unhappy and complained about their burgers taking a long time. Our waiter later explained to us that they were having a problem with the computer system. I'm guessing some of the orders did not get put into the system, which caused the delay. Despite that, it seemed like a bad day for the staff. Our waiter did not even ask my husband how he wanted his burger cooked. When my husband told the waiter later that he did not get to tell him how he wanted the burger cooked, the waiter said he thought he said medium. Actually, I was the one who said medium. My husband always prefers his meats rare, so it's not possible for him to say medium. \n\nAnyway, when the burgers came out, they looked just like they look in the pictures: juicy and delicious. I was quite pleased with my Kiki burger, although I found it just a tad sweet. I enjoyed all the flavors mixed in together with the shiitake mushrooms, juicy Angus burger, the veggies, and the soft bread. I had a bite of the Wagyu burger and immediately fell in love with the Wagyu. I think I might have liked the Wagyu more than my Angus burger! \n\nI can see why people wait for this restaurant. It's one of the better burgers I've tasted, but the way that the restaurant was being run could have been a lot smoother, especially with all those employees. I'd like to come back to Bachi, but I hope that the restaurant will operate much more fluidly when I return. It would be good if they could expand outside of Vegas and open it in Los Angeles. I bet it would be a hit!\n\nUPDATE: They're opening one on Sawtelle!"

Both fries were pretty good eats.  I'll stick with my matcha green tea smoothie from Jamba next time, the tea was too grassy for my taste.

The shogun burger is my go to burger, but today I decided to try the miyagi-San burger and it's was yummy! The chili mayo paired with the grass fed wagyu beef with furikaki and onion rings were a tasty treat.  Definitely try this burger :) \n\nHonestly for me, nothing beats the shogun burger. Foie gras and wagyu pair together so wonderfully! The presentation alone is executed exceptionally.  The first bite is heavenly. Juicy. Flavorful. Surprising. Yes I am still talking about the shogun! If you got the extra cash to fork up $26 for a burger do so!

S'So I decided to bring a friend here for his birthday last night. There were four of us. Three of us ordered the Kiki\'s Burger, the other got the spicy miso burger. All of the burgers had good flavor. The problem is with temperature, my wife ordered hers medium rare, as she always does, but one half of the burger looked as if it had barely even touched the grill. I know raw hamburger when I see it, it was raw. The server apologized and said she would show it to the boss. She then returned and said the boss responded that my wife needs to order medium next time. I have been in the restaurant business for a long time, that is not how you respond to a complaint. They sent a complimentary desert to apologize, fine. The server then dropped the check without the burger on it, I thought that was great, I didn\'t ask they just made it right...WRONG! After I put the money in the check book to pay, the server returned and said "I\'m sorry, she made me add the burger back on." Needless to say, I will never visit this establishment again, they treat customers wrong and I would rather spend my money where it is appreciated. I will also stop recommending it to friends, which I used to do frequently. You lost a loyal customer Bachi Burger...nice going.'

My "no meat" burger was an odd sounding combo of flavors- barley, tofu, eggplant, walnuts, etc, but it was the best vegetarian burger I\'ve ever had. Onion rings were great but salty.

However, this was my second visit to Bachi Burger, and this place still rocks. We were three ravenous hikers fresh off a three hour drive back from Zion, still coming down from the adrenaline high of hiking Angel's Landing. So naturally we stuffed our faces with the truffle fries (fantastic), kiki burger (amazing), spicy miso burger (good), peking duck steamed buns (good but covered in cilantro which I HATE), and I topped all that off with a chocolate peanut butter milkshake (good... but definitely overkill at that point). The Asian fusion is right on point, and the burgers are clearly made with high quality ingredients with a lot of thought going into the various flavor combinations.\n\nMy only complaint is that the bathrooms were not very clean and they made us wait for a table at 3 PM on a Sunday, even though the restaurant seemed pretty empty. Also the parking lot (where you have to wait for your table) smells horrendous because there is a dumpster full of rotting fish from the sushi restaurant next door."

S'Burgers re-imagined in the style of popular Asian comfort food...fusion disaster or synergistic food nirvana?  That was the question I sought to answer when I stepped into this southeastern joint with my sister visiting from out of town and two other friends.  \n\nBeginning with an appetizer: \nOxtail Chili Cheese Fries "garnished" with a sunny side up egg...let that concept wrinkle your brain for a minute,\n\nPortion is definitely worthy of sharing with 4.   Shaq would have better luck winning a game of Jenga than my attempting to eat this with one\'s hands without making a hot mess.   Armed with forks, we broke the egg all across the beautiful pastiche of crisp golden fries, hearty oxtail chili, and luscious gooey cheese that harmonized in a beautiful symphony of texture and flavor.  \n\nThe hardest part was deciding on burgers, so we each agreed to order a distinct burger and cut them into quarters for all to sample.  Although the waiter suggested we order them medium, I think we chose wisely with medium rare.\n\nBurger #1 The Ronin\n\nIn the movie Ronin, when DeNiro\'s character is asked about how he avoids an ambush, he replies "Whenever there is any doubt, there is no doubt."  When I glanced at the description and read the reviews of my trusty Yelpers on what appears to be the gold standard of the Bachi Burgers, I had no doubts this one was going to be a winner.  Perfectly cooked patty topped with some nuttiness from miso-goma dressing, tanginess from Katsu bbq sauce, crunch from the Japanese slaw, binded together with the runny yolk of a fried egg and then slathered with a citrus-yuzu aioli, if you haven\'t started drooling on your keyboard, perhaps you need to get your salivary glands checked out.\n\nBurger #2 The Kalbi Burger\n\nSomewhat of a misnormer since they use ground beef and pork rather than the marbly beef short rib from which its name sake is inspired, but nonetheless well executed.  Along with a korean-inspired mayo, green onions, and a healthy punch of kimchee, the flavor profile is great although I would have preferred a stronger spice component with hotter chili paste.  Nice touch with a banchan accompaniment of spicy korean pickles.\n\nBurger #3 "The Crusty Crab\'s replacement"\n\nCan\'t recall the name of this one since it was one of the specials and is supposed to be the replacement for The Crusty Crab, which was essentially a crabcake sandwich, but this one is like a Steak Oscar between two pieces of bread so I\'ll temporarily call it the Krabby patty, in honor of Spongebob Squarepants.  Beef patty topped with crab, scallop, a fried egg, and some crispy vegetable component that has slipped my mind, Plankton would gladly hatch a scheme to serve this burger to compete with the Krusty Krabs.   \n\nBurger #4 Spicy Miso Burger\n\nHighlights include Angus beef, roasted garlic, apple vinaigrette (side note: totally would have missed this word in a spelling bee because of that sneaky extra i), and shishito peppers.  This one was like the cute girl next door standing alongside the other three supermodels of burgers.  Nothing to complain about, but not much of a revelation either.  The finely shredded lettuce has a propensity to lose its crunch amongst the liquid components without providing any added flavors like a spicy arugula.  Don\'t be intimidated by the name, as shishito peppers are not considered anywhere close to spicy as its other Asian cousins in Chinese or Thai cuisine...not really sure if I could even make it out, which probably relates to the final point: the apple vinaigrette overpowers the other mild components so that you don\'t get the popping off of distinct flavors as in the other burgers.\n\nIn summary, the patties were well seasoned and sufficiently moist, the brioche-like bun is probably personal preference since it is soft and heavy as opposed to light and toasty (reminds me of the baked pork buns at dim sum), although I would have to say the Ronin comes closest to living up to Barney Stinson\'s highest compliment for any budding burger connoisseur:  "I love this burger so much I wanna sew my ass shut!"'

S"Asian style burgers? It was good, but it wasn't as amazing as I thought it would be. Reminds me of Umami Burger here in SF, but bigger and better. \n\nTheir burgers use the same type of buns for barbecue pork buns! One unique thing I noticed. And their meat patties are marinated in some type of a sweet sauce. The burgers looks and tastes extra juicy! \n\nThey also have Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries. The fries were super addicting. It had a sort of a spice to it that made it so sweet yet savory at the same time. I honestly thought the idea of Ox Tail Chili Cheese Fries could have been executed better. Hmmn...maybe like more sweetness to the ox tail? Ox tail reminds me of braised beef, so if that slow cooked turned sweet tasting taste was drenched all over fries... I think I would have liked it much better. The chili all over the fries was okay. I sort of avoided eating it... weird I know since it defeats the purpose of having chili on this dish. \n\nI decided to get the Pork Belly buns. Sort of pricy, but pork belly tends to be expensive. Ever since my trip to NYC I have been craving this! It is hard to find a place serving even DECENT pork belly buns. This place was decent. It was dinky but I really liked it! This dish half-filled my satisfaction. \n\nTheir boba is fresh too! A bit of an increase in price for your average boba, but they serve it in a nice glass cup! \n\nFriendly workers here! Nice modern Asian fusion burger joint."

S'I gave 3 stars because the food was good but the service was horrible and $9 for a burger without regular fries is over-price to me.  We came for a late lunch on Sunday and the wait was 40 minutes even though they told us 25 minutes and then everything was slow there from taking our orders to getting the check. We ended up spending almost 2 hours there for a burger lunch; however, we had 2 different types of specialty burgers and they were both good.'

S'Everytime I go here, it\'s awesome. We have nothing like it in Jacksonville and the dishes are so unique and flavored so well that you ask yourself "why didn\'t I think of that?!?" \n\nThis go around, me and my buddy had the oxtail chili cheese fries, pork buns, Kiki burger, ronin burger and the Parmesan truffle fries. \n\nThe oxtail chili cheese fries were really good. The oxtail was so tender like pulled beef and made the chili so much better than just regular ground beef chili. \n\nThe pork buns were great! The pork belly was braised really well and the pickle and eggs together in the bun made the perfect combo. The side sauce (homemade hoisin?) was the kicker that sent it over the top. \n\nThe burgers are sooooo good here and so original. It\'s hard to describe the intense Asian flavors and the combinations that each burger has. All I can say is that you must try for yourself. Every burger I\'ve had here has that perfect balance to create a tsunami of umami. Sweet, salty and savory mixed with sour pickled... And that potato bun... two perfect pillows holding everything together. \n\nThe Parmesan truffle fries are everything you expect. Shoestring fries topped with Parmesan cheese with a hint of truffle and topped with a porcini sauce. Really good side dish for the burgers. \n\nService was impeccable and the cleanliness was comforting. Always a great experience and will always come back!'

S'I really wanted to give this place 5 stars, but something they did in the beginning irked me so much that I spoke about it even after we left.. The wait time was said to be 25 minutes for a party of 3. It ended up  being about an hour wait, but that wasn\'t the worst part. There was a party of 2 sitting at a table made for 3 or more... when there was a table for 2 that was open right next to them. So guess where they sat our party? Yes, they sat my party of 3 in the table made for 2 when they could have easily moved the party of 2, who just got their waters, to our table. It bugged me so much that I had to take a star away from them...  \n\nBUT the food made up for that silliness. \n\n"Kiki Burger" Angus Beef, Saut\xc3\xa9ed Shiitake, Enoki & Eryngii Mushrooms Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion  Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese, Garlic Chili Aioli (Got the info from their website) BEST BURGER I\'VE EVER HAD. Everything about this burger was so right. The way the beef was cooked (order it medium, it\'s the best that way) down to how the buns were toasted. The mixture of the bacon, sweet onion and mushrooms were just heaven in my mouth. Seriously, the best I\'ve had. [$10-11] \n\nI ordered the "Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries" thinking that it would be enough for one person. I was so very wrong. It took 3 of us to take it down (still had left overs). Definitely a great combo too. It had an egg on top & the fries were crispy! Loved it as well! [$11] Service was on point & the place was very clean... Great experience here. Definitely will be back when I get back to Vegas. It\'s "a must have" for me now.'

S'I came here with sky-high expectations. The people I know who\'ve eaten here told me amazing things, but I found the food was just okay. The burgers and fries were good, but needed salt and pepper. So basic. I felt like they rely on sauces to make up for a lot of the flavor. The other thing I didn\'t like is that the menu has a lot of Asian items I\'m unfamiliar with. While I consider myself an adventurous eater, I want to have a pretty good idea of what I\'m ordering. I did ask the waiter to explain a few items, but I ended up going for a safe choice. \n\nBottom line, there was nothing "wrong" with the food, but I\'m not going to go home and crave the food from Bachi Burger. Honestly, In-N-Out is better, and cheaper.'

S'For the LOVE of FOIE!!\n\nI knew I had to make a trip to out Bachi Burger the next time I was in Las Vegas when I heard about the Shogun Burger!\n\nI could tell that this restaurant was not your ordinary burger joint after taking one glance at the menu.  This is one of the more modern restaurants that serve types of burgers you would not typically find at your local burger joint.  Bachi Burger offers various Japanese-inspired burgers, dishes, and sides. \n\nThe SHOGUN BURGER consists of Wagyyu Beef & Unagi, Pan Seared Foie Gras, Poached Asian Pear, Miso Butter, and Yamamomo Peach  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=Xc_YmEWXC7Rmv-9fncsOGA#Xc_YmEWXC7Rmv-9fncsOGA).  To be honest, my first bite was a little overwhelming from all the different flavors going on, lol.  But all the flavors melded together perfectly.  The wagyu beef was tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection.  The sweetness and tender poached Asian pear.  The rich, pan seared, slice of foie gras.  All of this, drizzled in miso butter, topped with arugula, in between a home made sweet bun  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=W9bCuQYgNjg2W-Fb2BBDkw#W9bCuQYgNjg2W-Fb2BBDkw).  Foie is already very rich to begin with, so I was not able to finish this burger in one sitting-- especially since we ordered sides as well.\n\nI tried some of my friend\'s CRUSTy CRAB Burger, but the burger was too salty for my liking.  It was difficult to taste all the flavors and ingredients in the burger but it wasn\'t too bad.  (Crab cake burger with mango chutney and tartar sauce).  The concept of making a "Spongebob-type" burger is cute though.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=JHZOUMJ4_JqyKjvo6aHHzg#JHZOUMJ4_JqyKjvo6aHHzg).  \n\nThe SWEET POTATO FRIES were fresh, crispy, lightly salted, and served with a Yuzu Citrus Aioli dipping sauce  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bachi-burger-las-vegas?select=xgwqimbyTmxJTnzr7bRITg#xgwqimbyTmxJTnzr7bRITg).  If you are  afan of sweet potato fries, you will not be disappointed!\n\nThe TRUFFLE PARMESAN FRIES were delicious.  Made with fresh cut potatos, tossed in white truffle oil, parmesan reggiano, porcini cream, served with sun dried tomato aioli  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=QgvNAbzuAF7sNnz7TpFy0g&userid=F28n26ynklEioZDInyK__A).  \n\nIf I weren\'t so full I would have ordered a few more items on the menu that made my mouth water:  the Peking Style Duck Steamed buns, Pork Belly Steamed Buns,  and Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries.  But that\'s just a few more reasons to come back! Woohoo!'

S"A little disappointed. While the creative parings and toppings were high quality and tasty the taste of the meat in the burger was a bit lacking.\n\nWe ordered the sausage app, the sausages were tasty, served with a nice whole grain mustard. They were just sausages really, nothing special. We also had the chili chicken, that was pretty tasty.\n\nI had the Spicy Miso burger and it was spicy! My sinuses started to clear just from smelling it but not too hot to bear. It was tasty but again I was disappointed with the flavor if the meat itself. The meat was a bit bland, hard and dry. I got the impression that it was a frozen wagyu patty. So while the overall burger was good, it was more like I had all these tasty toppings, sauce and spices wrapped around a bland burger. \n\nI give Bachi props for the unique creation of an Asian/Burger fusion and the creative tastes but in the end an inferior or frozen beef patty will bring a good burger down and ultimately why I couldn't give them 4 stars.\n\nOne tip if you get one of the burgers with a fried egg, be careful with the over medium egg..... Bite the wrong way and you could have a blast of hot liquid yolk shoot all over you! LOL"

S"Let me start off by saying I would give more stars if the service wasn't lacking so much. We first arrived, the front area was packed. It was about a 10-15 minute wait. There was nowhere to stand or sit inside, so waited outside. The man told us he would come and get us when our table was ready. No one came for us so my husband went in to check to see how much longer the wait was and they just happened to be calling his name (they said they were going to come and get us, so I don't know why they were calling his name). The front area definitely needs to be managed better and set up differently. It seems way too small.\n\nThe server was nice but she seemed like she was overly busy. She wasn't very attentive at all. Her mind seemed to be elsewhere. We ordered our drinks and it took her a while to get them back to us. My husband was annoyed because his beer wasn't cold and the glasses weren't frosted (when she told us they were). The glasses were like shot glasses. I've never seen a beer glass so small. Is that the new thing? Maybe I'm out of the loop, lol. \n\nThe food was good but nothing I was amazed by. We ordered a side of fries for our son and we loved the pineapple ketchup it came with. That was yummy. We also started off with the oxtail chili fries. My husband really enjoyed them, me not so much. They were too spicy for me because of the jalape\xc3\xb1os and I was also wondering where the oxtail meat was? There was also barely any beans. The fries were a bit overcooked too for my liking. Some of them were way too crunchy. Also, when the fries first arrived at our table, the egg was already broken. That's no fun! \n\nFor our entrees, we split the Peking Duck Steamed buns and the Ronin burger. The duck buns were very good with the hoisin sauce. The buns were steamed perfectly and the fried egg mimicked cheese. They were definitely delicious. I'd like to try the pork belly buns. The biggest disappointment of the night was the Ronin burger. We would have been extremely satisfied if they cooked it medium like we requested. The burger came out well done. They cooked the angus beef way too much. We don't like sending food back so we just ate it as is. However, we did let the waitress know that they overcooked it. The flavors of the burger were delicious though. If they cooked it medium then it would have been great. The cole slaw, fried egg, onions, and aioli had a great taste. The bun was also grilled a bit too much. \n\nThe decor was cool but there was a big eyesore out on the front deck of the restaurant. There is a pile of old cooking equipment outside which makes it look really unprofessional. At the end of our meal, we felt like we were being rushed out by the waitress. My husband wasn't even finished his beer and the waitress came over asking if we needed the credit card settled. We hadn't even gave her a credit card so I don't know why she thought that. Her mind was definitely lost. Overall, the place is good but has potential to be better than it is if they fix a few things."

S"First off, it was a little bit hard to find going west on Windmill. The parking and door is around behind Subway. I think there was another door on the Windmill side it looked like.\n\nI met a couple of my friends here for lunch at around 12. It was not that busy when we got there, but 30 mins later bigger parties starting arriving and seemed to get busy.\n\nI got the kalbi burger which was topped with kim chee and a kochujung mayo. SO FREAKING GOOD! It came with a side of cucumber kimchee as well. Surprisingly, I would have liked it to be a tad bit more spicy, but the flavors were all there. \n\nI got a side of the truffle parmesan fries as well, and those were very very delicious. I haven't tried anything with truffles before but heard its awesome. And.. IT WAS. \n\nMy friend got the ronin buger, and he said he didn't care for it too much. He didn't really like the pickled slaw. My other friend got the peking duck steamed buns, which looked awesome! We both thought it was weird that it had boiled egg in it. But she said it was really tasty, but could've used less of the cilantro. The next time, I will get that, and I love cilantro so hopefully they pile it on.\n\nI got my boyfriend the bahn mi burger to-go since he was at work. So, we shall see if he likes it.. Then we can return, so he can get the full dining experience.\n\nI have to say.. service kind of sucks here. Or at least when I was there. We never got our waters filled until we had to ask. Expect to wait 15-20 mins for the food.. but worth it for the food. We waited for a good 15 mins with an empty table and to-go bags, and ended up going up to the cashier to try to get our checks, where they said they'd be with us shortly. We had to wait another 10 mins before we got our check. With our waiter passing us, he didn't take our check with payment, so I ended going back to the cashier to pay. I saw another table try at least 3 times to get their waiter's (same guy) attention for something. The woman finally went up to guy to let him know they needed something.\n\nOverall, service was definitely lacking.. but the food most definitely NOT. Will be back again to try that peking duck!"

S"Celebrating for Spartan Race we wanted to reward ourselves. Assuming everything in The Strip would be packed for dinner we decided to try avoiding the chaos and thought Bachi Burger wouldn't be packed...we were semi-correct. A decent wait for some delicious food.\n\nAmbiance: \n* Parking | It is plaza parking so it is quite busy.\n* Seating | A fair amount of seating, about 50-70 people bar or group seating.\n* Feels | Typical restaurant feel with trance/electric music and definitely always crowded.\n\nFood:\nCaramel Milkshake | Sweet and caramelly. The smoothie smoothly went through the straw and was enjoyable with every strip\nRed Velvet Milkshake | The concept of red velvet is overrate but even I gave in. No regrets delicious it was. \nOxtail Chili Cheese Fries | Definitely a unique taste with the oxtail, egg, cheese and the additional appetizers. This is plentiful so do share.\nTruffle Parmesan Fries |  Typical yet delicious truffle parmesan fries. If you are in the mood for something lighter, go for this.\nBanh Mi Burger | Where to begin? The delicious mix of pork, shrimp and vinegar just to name a few made these american feel into a good asian fusion.\nMr. Ho's Burger | The sausage and mushrooms were delicious, juicy, and had awesome texture.\n\nCustomer Service:\n* We waited for about 20-30 minutes. It's strange we walked us in and escorted us to the back patio to wait where we just sat and listened to trance/electric music. Other than that the servers were attentive and fixed my order when there was a problem, no charge!\n\nOverall: \n* 5 stars. A very unique burger place, I can't think of any place. The wait was fairly respectable and worth it. The customer service was excellent and the food was unforgettably delicious: the creative marinations and combinations of lemongrass, fish sauce, pickled vegetable just to name a few... I would definitely come back and try their other menu items. Till next time, Bachi Burger!\n\n\nAdvice:\n* Come during non-common business ours."

Got seated and waited a good 30 min for our food.\n\nBurgers were good, I got the oxtail chili cheese fries. So not worth it, barely any oxtail, it was more like beans, cheese, and fries. Overall, stick to the burgers.'

The food choices is definitely asian-inspired where it brings multiple cultures mixed together very well. \n\nIt had a burger with Foie Gras which was pricey but very very well made. They had some burgers with eggs in it which was a huge plus for me as I'm an eggs guy!\n\nTheir pork belly steam buns was point on and just fantastic! \n\nThe nacho fries was just over the top!\n\nRed Velvet smoothie really tasted like it! I only wished they were generous of the portion especially when it was $5!!\n\nThe service could have been more attentive, but they were definitely sweethearts making sure we were taken care of when they notice you."

S"I first came here after finding out that it was going to be featured on Triple D. We wanted to check it out before it was unveiled to the world and then everyone would be flocking to it. Since then, I've gone back a bunch of times and every time the food has been delicious (It makes me sad to see that some yelpers had bad experiences 'cause I just can't imagine it).\n\nI've tried a variety of burgers and appetizers now. You really can't go wrong with anything you choose. The flavors are delectable, and it's all so unique. I would have to say my favorite burger is the Kalbi burger--I order it without kimchi though. Fabulous flavors from the meat to the sauce that they put on it. I've also had the Banh Mi Burger, the Ronin, and a couple more I can't recall right now. Again, I can't think of a single thing to complain about any of them. \n\nEveryone should try the oxtail chili cheese fries, though. I know the name can be intimidating to some who aren't adventurous in their food experiences, but it is so delicious! The meat part reminds me of bbq pulled pork, but it has a kick to it that makes it a little spicy. On top of thinly cut fries and a fried egg, this app is amazing. The fries, whichever way you get them, are good. Thin cut, so there's a bit of crunch to them. The other appetizer I've had was the Bachi Pickles. From my understanding, it changes almost day to day because it just depends on what vegetables the chef felt like pickling the night before. It was very different and interesting. I liked most of them, but I wouldn't say it's the dish for everyone.\n\nAlmost every time I've gone, I've ordered the jasmine milk tea with boba to drink. It's so delicious. I wouldn't say the boba is amazing, but it's decent for a restaurant. I just love that milk tea. It's very floral, though, so I wouldn't recommend it to someone that doesn't like very flowery tasting tea.\n\nFinally, the servers have always been really nice. The wait time has gone up since it's aired on Triple D, of course, but it's never really that bad. It's almost a coin flip. I've gone on a regular Monday night and the place was packed; probably a 30-40 minute wait to be seated if memory serves me correctly. Then I've also gone on a Tuesday night and barely anyone was there, so it just depends on how lucky you are I suppose."

The cod was moist and not dry, if u like cod like I do. Give this burger a try, especially with lent approaching. \nIf you are an American burger fan this might not be your place. If u have an ounce of foodie adventurer in you. You should love this place. Bring friends an excellent place to hang."

S"The hype is real, people!\n\nPrior to coming to Vegas, I was recommended by a friend to come check out this place. From my belief, there are 2 locations both off the strip. We went to the Windmill location which was about 20 minutes away. When we got there at 11am, there was already a small line starting to form. I got the grass-fed wagyu burger. It was good but it was a little bit on the sweeter side and I don't like my burgers sweet. I also got a chance to try the spicy miso burger. That was a little salty for me, but again, still very good. The winner of the day? The oxtail chili cheese fries. You will dieeee. Must get!!! \n\nSince our meal was so good, we decided to come back a second time the next day before leaving Vegas. This time around we tried the ramen. It's really rare that a burger joint would also serve ramen, let alone be good at it so I was extremely skeptical. BUT, much to my surprise, the ramen was so good as well! My favorite is the spicy ramen with extra meat. Their meat is sooo fatty and melts in your mouth but it's so good. I suppose being a fatty every once in a while is no biggie :)\n\nTheir service is amazing. Everyone was extremely friendly and attentive. I will come back here every time I'm in town!"

On a recent trip we decided to do take out so we wouldn't waste any time! My gf and I split the Spicy Miso and Miyagi-San burgers. SO BOMB omggg. I can't remember exactly what's in both so look it up! I def liked the Miyagi-San burger better but both were good! A couple gf's got the Oxtail Fries.. also to die for! Chili and fried egg ahhh *salivates*.\n\nThey made our order quick too and there were 7 different phone orders! They didn't seem irritated bc man I would be lol. They have a bar inside. I wouldn't mind actually sitting down to eat there one day. Looks like they may happy hour too. Check it out! Two locations for your convenience ;)"

That burger is soooo tasty and juicy! And it had mushrooms, which is another plus because I love mushrooms! MUST TRY! We also got the Miyagi, and that too was so yummy. I love the taste of the furikake on the onion rings! We also ordered calamari and I loved that they weren't stingy with the calamari, it was a big serving to share (there were 3 of us).

The normal strip mall restaurant in Vegas. It was clean but small.\n\nI had the Spicy Miso burger and it was good. I've had better at places like Umami or Plan Check in LA, but it was respectable.  The mix of egg, Angus and the shishito peppers with an apple vinaigrette was well done.  I'd probably go back.\n\nAlso, they were out of Blue Moon, which I read in another review here...you'd think they'd be able to stock more beer, how hard is that?"

S"This is THE BURGER place! I have been coming here since they opened. Although I could've left a review back then, I didn't.  I felt like the restaurant needed to establish themselves with better servers (& they have!!). The burgers are so delicious here that my fiance and I have been taking our friends and fam from out of town here.  Everyone agrees that the burgers/fries/dessert are soooo good, they have *bachi* cravings.  Some of our faves are the Ronin & Kiki.  Most of our group like the garlic salt & pepper fries and the sweet potato fries.  They also have refillable iced matcha green tea and a wide selection of boba teas.  The boba teas are good, but I've had better. I like going to actual boba tea establishments for that.  One night around 11pm, my friends and I did not know where to go for dessert and no one wanted to go to the strip or get yogurt.  It's so awesome that bachi is opened late and we got to eat the portuguese donuts, bread pudding and pop tart (OMG they don't have these anymore...)."

S'FINALLY!!! After seeing this yummy burger spot featured so many times on Food Network & Cooking Channel shows I finally got to experience it...TWICE in one weekend! :D\n\nI wasn\'t planning on eating a "dirty" meal our first night we got to Vegas since I wanted to still look somewhat lean for the Olympia Expo (cuz everybody that attends that convention and show is just shredded to the max and I can\'t go in lookin\' like a flabby chump) but I ended up fasting for over 22 hours and I needed a place to eat STAT! So I ended up here, at Bachi, alone since the SBBF had his own team dinner to attend.\n\nI didn\'t have to wait long to be seated even during their busiest dinner hour (7-8pm). Once I was seated I knew exactly what I wanted for my appetizer to start, the Oxtail Chili Cheese Fries of course! I love the fact that the table of 6 seated right next to me ordered the same appetizer, but for their entire table. And I loved it even more when my fries came out and I literally devoured that ish like a BEAST and I could tell that party of 6 were either horrified watching, or completely entertained. As I was scarfing these fries down I could taste every bit of authentic flavor to this dish. OMFG! Seriously the best of the best chili cheese fries I\'ve ever had! I love how crispy these fries were and the oxtail flavor was just orgasmic. The raw jalapenos mixed in with the garlic aioli was heavenly. And the final cherry on top to this dish, that fried egg...omg, as I broke into that egg and it seeped down through all the fries, I seriously was jizzing all up in my panties right then and there!\n\nNow onto the burger! I ordered the Miyagi-san\'s Grass Fed Wagyu Burger which came with the most delicious beef patty, chili mayo, fried egg, furikake, caramelized bacon and crispy onion rings. The bun itself had the right crunch and chewiness to it. I enjoyed every bit of this burger. Thanks Kristi (my waitress) for the recommendation!\n\n**The following night...around 11:30pm we returned to Bachi! Technically, I returned here and just brought the SBBF along.**\n\nAppetizers: \n1) Truffle Parmesan Fries with parmesan reggiano, black truffle porcini cream slathered all over it with a sun dried tomato aioli as the dip. The fries were delish! That black truffle cream hit the spot for these fries. There\'s really no need to even dip into the aioli because I felt it took away from that black truffle flavor on the fries.\n2) Sweet Potato Fries dusted with sea salt and a yuzu citrus aioli for the dip. You can honestly never go wrong with sweet potato anything! These were bomb diggity, end of story.\n\nBurger:\nI went for the Kalbi Burger this time with angus beef, kalbi marinade, green onions, house made KIM CHEE and a ko chu jang mayo. I think because of the fact that I\'m a kim chee whore, this burger totally topped the burger I had the night before. OMG! Flavor was just amazeballs! And the pickled cucumbers that came on a little side dish was heavenly! Mmmmmmmm baby!\n\nI also ordered their hot Japanese matcha green tea both times I came here. You get free refills with their teas and it was delicious. \n\nService is top notch here. They are very attentive and efficient. I\'m definitely returning to Bachi the next time we\'re in Vegas. It\'s a f*ckin must I tell ya!'

S"The fact that bachi is so highly reviewed is proof that off-strip Vegas is starving for anything quasi-hip or boutiquish.  In most food scenes, bachi would be out of business inside of 8 months.  They cannot grasp the idea of consistent food prep or service. Been to bachi 3 times and each trip left me irked that I paid the bill.  They've never gotten an order right. Also, slowest delivery of my food I've encountered in town (on or off strip).\n\nThese reviews here say less about the quality of bachi and more about the power of quasi-cool to convince people that something is better than it is.  To be sure, the owners, cooks and server's friend know how to use social media and Internet marketing to promote and polish this turd. \n\nGo anywhere else on your list and you'll be happier."

S"So I dunno if you've ever been in a situation where you're really hungry and you're thinkin, 'Do I want a Burger, or do I feel like a hot bowl of Noodles?'  So typical..... I've been there on numerous occasions and let me tell you, I could ponder that fork in the road for hours...if only there was a place that served both..... Tadaaaa!\nWell, it's not exactly one place, more like two places adjacent to each other by chef/owner Lorin Watada; whose fusion burger fame, 'Bachi Burger' has propelled her into Ramen game - the current 'it' food in Vegas.  Not that there can be enough Japanese fare in my opinion!\n\n\nHachi Machi, give me a Bachi!!!\n \nBachi Burger is a Japanese Hybrid Burger joint serving the American classic  with Japanese twists.  It's become the culinary zeitgeist to throw a bunch of 'Asian' ingredients on anything and see what whacked flavor comes out (yack) yielding moderate to disastrous results.  Innovation is great but sometimes you just have to go simple.  \n\nBut when I feel like having something other than you standard Burger fare, I look to Bachi - the flavor combinations are nostalgic and the burger quality is pretty good.  Also, there's a proximity and it's open all the time (unlike the Foodtrucks that are sooo good, but just a scheduling/coordinating pain).  There's a previous review of Bachi - go ahead and read and you'll get what I'm talking about below...\n\nDid you read it? Ok, good. Just as a summary, they serve a lot of Asian style dishes as appetizers, Chinese Bao's, Chicken Karage and Edamame, so you get a harmonic blend of Asian bites with All American Burgers. And for a guy like me who has trouble deciding on one cuisine, I get a bit of everything like an international buffet..but with good food.\n\n\nTruffle Parmesan Fries:\n\nParmesan Reggiano + Black Truffle Porcini Cream + Sun Dried Tomato Aioli.  In my previous posts, I complained that I enjoyed what little gravy they provided for this cone heap of Fries that they stingily provide.\nIt seems that someone was listening; upon my recent visit, the Fries came with a generous portion of the creamy gravy that made those Fries uber luxurious and thoroughly fulfilling.  The Sun Dried Tomato Aioli does not work at all with the Truffle cream, however, since there is a portion of fries near the bottom of the cone that is not coated with decadent sauce, the Aoli serves a good condiment for those untouched by the earthy goddess...\n\n\nKiki Burger \n\nI've had the Ronin Burger which was pretty good, and the Black and Green Burger was amazing.  But my favorite is the Kiki Burger: an Angus Beef Patty with saut\xc3\xa9ed Shitake, Eryngii and Enoki Mushrooms, Caramelized Bacon, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Gruyere Cheese and a Garlic Aioli.  When I first reviewed this Burger, my biggest complaint was that overabundant smattering of the Aioli drowning out the flavor of all the other ingredients, including the Burger.\n\nWell, much to my pleasure, they had listened; the Plate was served with the Aioli on the side, which could be knifed on to one's liking.  This made a world of difference, you could taste all the awesome flavors that this burger has to offer: The charcoal permeated through the Beef, which alone was satisfying, the Gruyere + Caramelized Bacon elevated the unctuous bass level notes, while the Sweet Onion Marmalade was savory and sweet. I added my own level of Garlic Aioli, just enough kick to spice it up before each bite....Super delish!\n\n\nSo, now it come down to the Battle: who won?\n\nFor Appetizers:  I don't know, they both so different!!\nFor Main:          I can't choose - they're both sooo good!!!\nFor Dessert:      Bleah.....\n\nThere really is no battle, if you feel like having Burgers, ie. red meat, got to Bachi.  If you cold and need to warm up with a great bowl of Ramen with some great Broth, get yourself on over to Shoku Ramen Ya.  I love both of these places and it's always hard to decide each time I'm in front of these two doors!\n\n\n\nBachi Burger                                                     \nRatings (Out of Five Stars)                                   \nFood:         4.5                                                   \nAmbience:  3                                                      \nService:      4         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlways start off with a plate of Gyoza, it's like a cultural tradition of Ramen Shops to provide these half dozen, moon shaped crispy delights stuck together like little piglets.  It's always a little game to try and pick them off without ripping the skin, retaining the piping hot filling within its crackling confines.  As for t"

S"It was past midnight as my homegirl and I were driving back to my place as conversation about grabbing dessert arose. After some driving, she suggested a place she actually used to work at that had boba and other snacks and before I knew it, we were pulling into Bachi Burger's parking lot.\n\nMy first impression of this place was obviously the interior. The place looked modern and so comfy. What made my experience here so dope was not only the food but the friendliness of each of the staff members. The manager made our visit very pleasant, as he joked around with my friend and I. The service was definitely top-notch and a lot better than even high end restaurants I've dined at in the past. It was easy to see that the servers were genuinely nice and enjoyed engaging in conversations with you. I even noticed how personable our server was as he made an effort to stop at every table every so often. I feel bad for forgetting his name so hopefully he sees this and pats himself on the back 'coz he is awesome.\n\nNow.. onto the food. It took me a while to decide what I wanted since I wasn't hungry enough for a burger but had the appetite for something larger than just a dessert, which was what I wanted originally, haha. After scanning Yelp for a few suggestions, I went with the truffle parmesean fries and the mandarin orange tangerine soda (which I learned they make themselves). As cliche as this sounds.. it was definitely LOVE AT FIRST BITE. The truffle oil on the fries was the perfect touch with fries that weren't too crispy or too soft. The sun-dried tomato sauce paired with the fries was the cherry atop the sundae. The mandarin orange tangerine soda was simply amazing for something that sounds so simple. My friend told me this place is owned by two brothers, one being a former executive chef for Roy's Hawaiian Fusion. No wonder this place is so damn good!  As we sat and enjoyed our better than dessert midnight snack, I watched as the table next to us received their burger orders. The burgers looked mouthwatering. I was this close to ordering one but I'll save that for my next trip.This place is perfect for late night cravings, as they are open until 2AM. We left at around 130 and there was even still another table present but the dope staff didn't even rush them to leave. I definitely will be returning soon and by then, I'm sure Bachi Burger will be a household name. This is a restaurant that deserves to be part of the hype 'coz it sure as hell lives up to it."

The oxtail fries were great (hence why they got 3 stars) but the burgers were blah.  The meat was flavorless and is only complimented by the several different ingredients added to the burger.  The pork belly was pretty good but again mediocre because I can get this at Chinatown and it's just as good.  I really wish this place was as good as everyone says, but sorry, it's just not."

It was very plain, and came with a little plum of some sort which did little to enhance the dish. The flavors were not at all complimentary. There was nothing that stood out about the meal AND you have to order your fries separately.\n\nI ordered the salt and pepper garlic fries because I love garlic and expected the salt and pepper to add a little kick. Ok...there was no garlic but there was a generous amount of ginger, which I really didn't expect. It was also under seasoned with salt and pepper. \n\nMy chili fried chicken was extremely salty. On the salty scale of one to 10, it was at an 8. They were also not as crispy as much as they were soggy and oily. \n\nOverall I was disappointed. I heard about this place on Diners, Drive-In, and Dives. That being said, I wasn't expecting to be blown away but I certainly expected a decent meal."

I haven't had one although I was thinking something on the sweeter side might be better.  Maybe honey and cinnamon or something.  And another thing...I just read up on truffle oil..its all just chemicals isn't it?  \n\nI got the Kiki burger w/ egg and it was awesome.  Burgers are always better with egg..that's a fact!!  The bun had a real chinese bread...nikumanish quality to it which I loved and it just made it THAT much better.  Got to try the Ronin and the Kalbi burgers too.  The kimchi was interesting on the Kalbi burger..not the traditional tasting type but really went well with everything else that was going on in between those 2 pieces of bread. \n\nWill definitely be back!"

S"Unique. Fantastic! Loved it!  We had a great lunch here after trying it for the first time.  It was around 2pm when we walked in and there was about a 10 minute wait.  I thought it would be an off time coming in but they were busy!  It must be a winner!\n\nWe decided to try a few different burgers and split them so we could taste a couple different things on the menu.  Our choices were the Kiki Burger and Spicy Miso Burger. \n\n~ the Kiki Burger had a fabulous blend of sauteed mushrooms, caramelized bacon and garlic chili aioli.  The flavorful bacon really stood out.  The buttery soft bun complimented this so perfect. The angus beef was absolutely cooked to perfection.  This burger is an A+!\n\n~the Spicy Miso burger was also such a delectable, mouth watering treat for my taste buds!  The unique combination of pepper mayo, onion, cheese and apple vinaigrette sent my world spinning!  Not to mention that they inserted a fried egg in between all of the other yummy ingredients.  WOW!! \n\nOn the side we went with the Truffle Parmesan and Sweet Potato Fries.  OH YEAH! They were crispy, full of flavor and served with a delicious dipping sauce.  This was great to change it up from the usual ketchup.   The truffle sauce gave the fries a different yet fabulous flavor with a hint of garlic taste.  Score!  The Sweet potato fries were just as delicious.  They were crispy and perfect with their chosen dipping sauce.  I'm not sure what this was but I was in heaven! \n\nI can't write this review without mentioning the phenomenal service they provided!  Our waitress was attentive, so friendly and courteous! She even asked us if we had any food allergies that the kitchen should be aware of.  This was the first time anyone ever asked me this!  That's amazing to me!  Plus they had others walking around with water pitchers to refill our glasses even when they weren't even half gone!  All restaurants should do this! \n\nWhy did I wait to long to try Bachi Burger? Now that I know how delicious their food is, I hope not to wait so long for my second visit.  If you want a different flare of a burger flavor...  this is definitely the place to go!   Can you tell I loved it?"

But I do remember the foie gras blew me away...and that's all I really remember.  Oh also we had an oyster each at the end, in lieu of dessert.  I guess the oyster was kinda sweet...so whatever.\n\nThe waiters and staff were helpful, I had a predinner drink at the bar with a friend too.  Also, our waiter helped us play a prank on the guy in our party who paid with a credit card...which involved writing a deceptively high gratuity on the receipt...that was fun!"

We started with the salmon app and their delicious crusty bread.  I had the mussels for my main course.  The bf had the kobe short rib special-awesome.  My sis-in-law had the halibut and my bro had the steak frites.  The desserts were amazing.  We had the ice cream trio- raspberry, peanut butter and grand marnier flavors and creme brulee...yummy!

S"We booked this place for a corporate event for over a hundred people so this probably isn't super helpful unless you're interested in bringing a large party here.\n\nThey sat us outside which in late May ended up being perfect and their outside seating area is great if you need a focal point for for an awards dinner. All but 2 out of maybe 12 tables can see the center point where we did our awards.\n\nWe had a pre-set menu and overall I had some complaints about the meal.\n\nFrom the 4 people who I know had salmon (myself included), we all thought it was a bit overcooked and thats a bummer b/c its pretty easy to keep salmon moist. I realize that its hard to make each dish your best when you're cooking for a hundred people at once. I don't know if it was cooked right there and then or if they ended up having another party delivering the food, but it ended up being a bit dry but still quite good.\n\nThe dessert was decent but nothing to rave about. \n\nBetween all the restaurants we've had our huge dinners at this ranks up there but if I was to look for a dinner place with my gf and based that on our experience, this wouldn't be a slam dunk choice.\n\nAgain, its hard to make everything perfect for 100+ people and overall this was a good experience."

S'We ate at Bouchon for dinner.\n\nTheir menu was so adorable. It was made out of paper and folded around each of our table napkins. We have to unfold it to see the menu choices.\n\nOur server was excellent. He was good at explaining what off-menu items there are. He also kept our table clean from the bread crumbs we get from eating their bread.\n\nOur water was kept filled by other waiters and our dishes were always taken away as soon as we were finished with them.\n\nMy recommendations:\n- Escargot: The escargot is served with a puffy pastry on top. The pastry was nice and crunchy and complimented the escargot pretty well.\n- Pate: Very yummy spread.\n- Mussels entree: The sauce and the mussels tasted pretty good.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the salmon which came with couscous. My dish did not taste salty at all and the salmon was not dry. However, I did taste some of the Steak "Diane" entree and it was pretty salty. The mussels entree was delicious though. The only thing I don\'t like about this entree is the big amount of fries they give. I try to avoid fries, but that\'s just me.\n\nI would come again in the future because of the great service and delicious appetizers. I will probably try something new for the entree though.'

S"Bouchon was the last on our list of restaurants to try before we flew home, so we came here for brunch.  I wish it would've been the first on our list because I would've been here everyday for every meal.\n\nLet me start off with the hostess, who just went above and beyond.  We had our luggage (carry on sized) with us and instead of us dragging them around to our seats, she lugged our heavy bags and checked them for us.  Once seated, she even took my messenger bag and placed it in the seat next to me so it wouldn't get dirty on the floor.\n\nThe waiter service was all smiles - I don't remember a time when our waiter came by and he didn't smile.\n\nI ordered the Croque Madame, which was good.  My boyfriend had the chicken and waffles - that dish is amazing.  The chicken was delicious and the waffles were light, crispy and airy.  We also ordered some of their pastries, which I highly recommend as well.  I just wish I'd seen their daily pastry specials prior to ordering what was on their menu.  Make sure you know what's available for the day, they have chalkboards on the walls.\n\nWhat a fantastic little bistro.  I only wish I could have savored everything they had to offer."

S"Food was good, service was good, and wine was good.  Overall, I can say that I was a fan of Bouchon, and will gladly try the restaurant again.  My friend, Mr. Bloewen had the steak and fries.  The fries were the most amazing french fries I had had the pleasure of trying.  His steak looked to be cooked perfectly, and my taste was really good.\n\nMy Booth had the Croque Madam.  For those of you that know Mr. Booth, he is a big chicken guy.  However, he ventured off of the norm, and really enjoyed his french specialty.\n\nI had the lamb.  The lamb had good flavor, but there were olives that it was served with.  I am not a fan of olives, so it did slightly decrease the experience for me.  Had I liked my dish better, or gotten one of theirs, I would have given Bouchon 5 stars.  It may have been my fault that I didn't read there were olives, but I wish the waiter would have given more suggestions or been more interactive.  He as basically just going through the motions.\n\nOur desert was OK, but not memorable.  We had some chocolate dessert, and an order of profiteroles.  The profiteroles were good.  Overall, it was a good meal, and I am glad that I finally went."

S"On the 10th floor of The Venetian, there is a gorgeous French bistro with lofted ceilings, delectable food and impeccable service. Apparently some guy named Thomas Keller put this whole thing together. He seems to know what he's doing.\n\nEverything impresses from the start. The martinis are perfect, the bread is fluffy and plentiful, and the pistachios a pleasant surprise. We started with the impossibly rich pate, and an equally decadent goat cheese salad. \n\nThe sizable appetizer portions left us too full to finish the tender, meaty lamb shank special (served atop mushrooms, greens and a buttery potato puree) and the curiously crispy gnocchi accompanied by endive, Kalamata olives and even more goat cheese. (Both dishes were nearly as appetizing the next day, but the presentation was far better at the restaurant than crushed together out of a mini-fridge at 5 am.)\n\nDid I mention this dinner was FREE?* And even better, they hand out free beer as you sit on the bench outside the restaurant, clutching your painfully full stomach. Wait, that might not be standard, actually. But some drunks did wander by and give me some of their Bud Light.\n___________\n\n*Well, free for me at least. Although Bouchon is not cheap by any means, it is surprisingly on the affordable end of celebrity chef restaurants in Vegas...so when the lady took the check, I put up little resistance. Because I'm a gentleman."

S"French breakfast.  One of the best breakfasts you will eat.  However, you have to be Indiana Jones to find the place in the Venetian.  Seriously....you have to go up an elevator after walking down a long corridor.  Then you see some guy standing behind a podium dressed nicely and I believe his only job is to point to his right....because he knows everybody that comes down that elevator is looking for Bouchon.  Then you have to dodge a huge boulder and the natives attempting to blow dart you.\n\nBut once you dust off the cob webs and make it through in one piece, you are in for a treat.  Actually you can get a basket of treats.  Seriously....they have a basket of danish (well I guess it isn't danish since it is a French restaurant), a basket of baked goods.  They are baked that day without a doubt because the freshness is there.  The type of confections that crumble when you touch them.  That is how you know you are about to eat something that is greater than anything else.  Now let's talk about the ambiance.  The restaurant looks like an upscale bistro.  It appears to be classier than another favorite French spot Mon Ami Gabi, and it seems it has a quieter feel as well.  Probably because half the patrons starved to death before making it to the restaurant.  \n\nHowever!  It is worth the sacrifice of life and limb.  The breakfast portions are huge.  The omelet is amazing.  The boudin sausage with eggs is an excellent choice.  The french toast is also a great choice as well.  You must realize that it is bread pudding style and not the type you may be accustomed to.  But that just means you need to try it more.  People need to experience different things in life.  People need to be challenged.\n\nHere is your challenge:\nPrepare for your trek to the restaurant by first visiting the man at the General Store (just like the game Oregon Trail).  Purchase some head of oxen, crates of food, and have a doctor in your party so nobody dies of drinking typhoid water while out on the trail.  Once you see the scarecrow attendant that points you to the right, give him a thumbs up and allow him to call his family.  I am certain they have not seen him in years.  Once you make it to the restaurant your next goal is to enjoy the food (which shouldn't be hard).  But how do you get home?"

S"Went here last night with some of my friends.  A once a year type deal for ourselves-\n\nWe were seated promptly and it was relatively quiet in the restaurant.  We were going to try sweetbreads and the marrow appetizers-unfortunately the sweetbreads weren't on the actual menu (only saw them online).  \n\nNumerous servers bustled around us, waters constantly topped off, but I can't say our head waiter was very attentive or helpful.  Plus, his accent with the general murmur of the restaurant made him pretty difficult to understand at times.  Very friendly though, and I'm sure had I asked more questions he would have been glad to answer them.  He did forget to mention the fact they were out of the lamb, however.  A mildly annoying fact that I'm sort of happy about after seeing other reviews on here.  o.O \n\nSo started with the bone marrow, a first for us all.  Was delicious.  The braising and the sauce was delicious.  My friend couldn't stand restaurants with so much waitstaff-but she lit up when she tried the first bite of it.  The soup of the day was a sweet potato with a strawberry?? stripe drizzled across.  The bright fruit flavor really made it.  \n\nEntr\xc3\xa9es were the steak and fries, braised short-ribs, and I decided on the chicken.  The steak was amazing (especially for being flatiron-not one I would traditionally consider as tender-man was I wrong)-french fries hardly lost any quality as they cooled off.  Wonderfully seasoned and crispy.  Short-ribs were meaty and delicious, with a similar flavor sauce to the bone marrow earlier in the meal.  Finally, the chicken-it's changed from the menu listed online (or at least it was).  It wasn't served with the brussel sprouts but with a dijon mustard sauce and sauteed mushrooms.  It was far and away the best chicken I've ever had in my life, the skin was crispy and delicious, the sauce was fantastic, and every bite was a pleasure.  The only minor criticisms I could give about it is it could really do with something fresh on the plate, and the white meat, at the thickest parts toward the wing, was a little overcooked.  The dark and most of the white was a joy though.  \n\nOverall-I enjoyed the experience.  Service was great if a little slow at times, not overly obtrusive, and the food was amazing- the steak and the chicken would have me back no problem.  And the marrow-while a small portion- was fantastic."

S"I was in Vegas for only 25 hours, attending a wedding. I stayed at the Luxor and ate my first lunch at the Pyramid Cafe (terrible). My dinner was typical wedding food (good intentions but still overcooked).\n\nSo I really needed to have at least one good meal in Las Vegas. Through a recommendation from friends and verified through Yelp, I decided to head over to Bouchon for breakfast.\n\nI only had about 40 minutes to get in and get out because I was heading straight to the airport afterward. I told my waiter Phillip that and he just hurried everything along. The service was extremely good.\n\nI ordered the Bouchon French toast and a capuccino. The food arrived quickly: a tower of custard-drenched brioche layers with cooked apples in-between, and topped off with crisp apple slices. It was delish. The cap was decent.\n\nThe whole experience was great. I can't say enough about the service. The food was definitely fantastic. And the best part was this meal cost LESS than my awful fish and chips at the Luxor."

From the moment we told the reception of our reservation we were called by name. The service was probably the best we received our entire stay in Las Vegas.  Our waitress was amazing in her recommendations, attentiveness and grace.  Both on the seafood site (my wife had salmon) and land (I had the lamb) food was delivered perfectly plated and there wasn't a flaw in the preparation. Had the half steamed mussels as an appetizer and white wine sauce it was prepared in was outstanding.

I didn't quite remember the other things we ordered form the first time, but I remembered the service and food was exceptional. \n\nthe second time around was a different story, I came in with my girlfriends. there were about 8 of us and we decided to have a fancy dinner for one of our friend's bday. we were staying at the Venetian, so I recommended to go to Bouchon because of my previous stellar experience here. \n\nonce we arrived, were seated at the round table and the server came and greeted us. he explained the menu, and some of us decided to share plates (typical girls). lol. \nanyways, I was really looking forward for the scallops, but he said that they didn't have it. I was pretty bummed out and decided to try the fish that was on the special. I also asked him to recommended one of the sweeter wines, but I didn't like the first one e recommended, so he brought out a dessert wine. it was really strong and tasted like liquor and I felt bad to return it, so I just passed it around the table. my food finally came, and it was just ok. the fish was slightly overcooked and under seasoned. the only highlight I had was the brownie I ordered for my dessert, which I also had the first time. my friend got a slice of the key lime pie for her bday, and it was really sour! I mean, I liked it because I love key lime pies but no one else did. the server was acting a bit snobby the whole night, and I can tell that he didn't liked it when some of us said that we're gonna split the plates or when we were asking him questions about the menu. I mean, it was their first time eating there. I felt bad for recommending this place to my girlfriends because only few of them actually enjoyed the food. \n\noverall, I was really disappointed on my second visit here and I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon :("

As the Big Pun\' so eloquently put it:  "I\'m not a playah, I just crush a lot."  \n\nStuff I crushed and wished I could have crushed more:  the petit plateau (seafood platter with oysters, clams, mussels, lobster) was fantastic. \n\nStuff I crushed but may not crush again:  main course was not too impressive:  the lamb was great but the grilled polenta that came with was kinda tasteless -- it didn\'t add much to the dish other than to provide some visual contrast on the plate.  \n\nWas running tight for a show, so didn\'t really have time to do dessert justice, but the raspberry cobbler was really good.  Service was on point.\n\nI haven\'t been to the French Laundry so have no basis for comparison, but my overall experience was a little "meh," mostly because of the main course and the compressed timeframe, which is really no fault of the restaurant.

S'I dont know why people seem to not think this place is awesome, but I suppose they should separate dinner from brunch. They are two different animals. A group of us went here for my GFs 30th bday. To our surprise our waiter Kristoff was from Poland as was the birthday girl and 2 others so this set an excellent tone to our dinner.\n\nStarters: House made bread and butter. This was perhaps the best I have had since I left Europe. I am accustomed to cheap excellent bread and we got as much as we could eat which was nice. Never once was there any attitude from anyone, and you could almost forget you are in a fine dining establishment. The house wines were delicious and quite pleasant on the palate. I also had the French Onion soup which was outstanding. \n\nDinners: I had the Steak Frites. It was stunningly cooked and the fries were the bomb. I tried my GFs duck and it was also outstanding. Everything was cooked beautifully, seasoned perfectly and beautiful to look at. This is how I remember french cooking. No one had anything negative to say which is unusual in a part of 6 demanding foodies. Hats off\n\nDesserts: We had basically one of everything. It was all good but I think the creme brulee and the custard (flan) stood out to me. The bouchons were nice but I am not a huge chocolate freak so others enjoyed things differently. Everything was delicious though so dont think I am not recommending anything. We also ordered some coffees and I liked that the caffe au lait was brought with refills left on the table. \n\n\nOver all I can only tell you that this is one of the best meals I have ever had. Its not cheap, but its also not outrageous. If you are in Napa or Vegas, be sure to visit for dinner. you wont regret it. The brunch while delicious is a distant second to the dinners. If you only pick one, make it dinner.'

I am not an expert of baked goods, nor do I usually like to eat them, but I got a hold of my wife's croissant. Boy was that a mistake! I didn't want to give it back to her! What?!

They continually set the bar for great service, food and wine selection across the board making my experience, along with my girlfriends, less Vegas and more memorable.  From the Carrot Soup Special to a perfect Creme Brulee, the service was perfectly executed down to the last bite.  The decor is beautiful that Parisians would be proud & the music volume and selection was subtle yet present.  Definitely worth going all in!!!"

S"Day 2...\n\nBrunch took us over to the Venetian. We've ate at Bouchon, Yountville and always enjoyed it. It was remarkably empty. Just 3 other tables filled.\n\nWe ordered:\n3 Omelets specials which consisted of Bacon and Chanterelle mushrooms. 1-Corn Hash which features small chunks of meat instead of the traditional shredded Underwood Devil's Corn-Hash style.\n\nSo far best of the trip."

S"I made a reservation here online for the wrong weekend but the hostess promptly seated us anyway. \n\nThe BF and I rolled into the restaurant in extremely casual clothing - shorts, tshirt, hoodie, flip flops - and boy did we stand out like a sore thumb. In fact, it was one of the first things we noticed. Everyone was dressed in nice evening wear. My apologies!! I'm from California, where even at the nicest restaurants, people wear tshirts and jeans!\n\nAnyway, they sat us anyway (they'll still take our money, is what the BF said). The server recommended some stuff and took our order. I got the gnocchi, which was the only vegetarian dish on the menu and I was sort of unsure about it because I had tried gnocchi before and didn't like it. \n\nThis gnocchi was different! It was REALLY good. It was lightly fried and had just the right amount of seasoning. Topped with kale, tomatoes, and celery. The only downside was it was a bit greasy so my stomach couldn't handle eating the entire dish in one sitting. \n\nThe BF got raw clams (which he liked, but said he prefers oysters to clams) and the duck dish, which he ate the whole thing.\n\nI wish we had room for dessert because I would've loved to try their creme brulee...\n\nNext time!!"

S"I had dinner here last weekend, and decided to order the gnocchi since I had it at Bouchon in Yountville.  I thought it was either overcooked and or dry, so sent it back for another order since it was what I came here for.  The next order wasn't much better, and the waitress and manager apologized and comped me my dinner.  Even though I didn't like my food, I still give them 3 1/2 stars for trying to make it right and apologizing.  The other thing that was annoying was that we ordered bottled water, and they took it away from the table to keep it on ice.  Well the busboy or expediter kept coming over and pouring tap water from a pitcher into our glasses.  The waitress had to keep coming over and tell the busboy not too do that.The atmosphere is pleasant and my wife liked her mussels.  I will have to go back to Yountville to see if my taste buds were correct.  They insist that it is the same recipe."

S"Our family had a fantastic birthday dinner at Bouchon and I'd love to come back in the future.  Service was perfect.  They checked on us often, but not too much.  They were accomodating and attentive to the birthday girl as well as the toddler at our table.\n\nMy favorite items were:\n\nThe Roasted Bone Marrow with garlic, parsley, shallots and sherry vinegar served with toasted bread.  Fatty and flavorful.\n\nThe Roasted Chicken with caramelized cabbage, forest mushrooms and whole grain mustard was tender and juicy.  I especially loved the tangy mushroom sauce and went really well with the chicken. \n\nImprovements:\n\nThe Gnocci was a little too soft and mushy.  I think it was cooked a little too long and the plating was inconsistent.  Two of us at the table ordered the gnocci and one of the plates had a good amount of vegetables, while the other had a few pieces."

S"I've been dying to eat at Bouchon for years and always because of budget and time, it has never happened.  Finally the perfect oppourtunity presented itself.  After a fantastic time at Phantom, everyone was down for a nice meal and being right upstairs of the theatre, Bouchon was a natural choice.\n\nTo begin, the staff was oh so attentive.  We were introduced to the maitre-d, the oyster guy and of course our server.\n\nWhile we were walking in we were excited by the food being displayed all around us.  \n\nUs three hungry girlies got the foie gras pate to share, the grand plateau, a huge assortment of seafood, shortribs and lamb.\n\nThe foie gras, what can I say.  Five ounces of pure heaven with crispy crunchy brioche to share.  Sure it was quite pricey, $50 to be exact, but well worth every penny.  The serving was more than enough for the three of us.  \n\nThe seafood was fresh and delicious but very standard.  Next time I wouldn't order just because you can get seafood anywhere.\n\nNow I normally don't like shortrib much, but this was melt in your mouth tender with crunchy bits of parsnip, carrots and god knows what else, probably crack.  The BEST BEST BEST BEST part of the dish was two deep fried morsels on the top.  Deep fried what you ask?  Deep fried BONE MARROW.  OMG.  I thought I had died and gone to foodie heaven.\n\nThe lamb was also very good, tender, juicy, on a bed of white beans I want to say.  \n\nWe couldn't breath after the meal but we finished off with some chocolate Bouchons and a chocolate mousse.\n\nWhat an amazing meal.  I think I need to have dinner here everytime I go to Vegas now.  Slurp!"

S"I love it here at Bouchon! I've never been disappointed coming here! The atmosphere is very elegant and I love the outdoor seating for brunch or on a warm summer night!  I do enjoy the indoor seating as well if I'm looking for more of a romantic scene.  \n\nMy favorite is the croque madame which is toasted ham and cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce served with French fries (a lot too!!!).  The mornay sauce is my favorite! It's light but yet very flavorful!\n\nTheir french toast is also really enjoyable!  Bread pudding style with warm layers of brioche, custard & apples. Served with maple syrup.  Because it's bread pudding style, it's very moist!  It's great if you love french toast but really REALLY love bread pudding!!\n\nLyonnaise potatoes are really good too! I've had some before but never like at Bouchon!  I've had them where they were just dry, but here the onions, the oil and the parsley all came together and created the best lyonnaise potatoes I've ever tasted!!\n\nFor dinner I tried\n\nFrench onion soup - very good!\n\nFrisee Salad with poached egg!  Good but I'm not sure if it was $14 good!  The poached egg did make the salad very good though.\n\nSteak frites! Delicious!  The meat was cooked to perfection!! Medium rare was what I had requested!  the ma\xc3\xaetre d'h\xc3\xb4tel butter that came with the steak was delicious!  Made the steak tasty!\n\nCrispy pork belly pave.  This was a special that night and my boyfriend got this and he loved it!  I think if you're a fan of bacon, you'll definitely enjoy this! Very flavorful and very moist!\n\nEverything I've had here was very good and portions are always more than enough! I was never able to finish any of my food!!"

S"I went here for dinner my first night in Vegas. It made sense, get the fancy dinner BEFORE losing all my money.\n\nBouchon was an experience. An amazing one. I'm a huge Thomas Keller fan but cannot quite afford to eat at The French Laundry. Just the menu at Bouchon makes you salivate, but when the waitress reads you the specials, there are so many items that make you drool even more.\n\nWe ended up ordering the kumamoto oysters which are my favorite. They aren't grimy like oysters can be. They are simple, fresh and delicious, complimented with a red wine vinegar, pepper and scallion sauce makes them out of thie world. Then came the pork belly and crab fritters. I find a lot of restaurants to miss a lot with pork belly, but Bouchon definitely hit a home run. The pork belly was amazing but would I really loved were the crab fritters.\n\nThey had an amazing wine menu, we ordered a chianti that was lightly crisp and delicious. \n\nMy main dish was the Steak Diane a hanger steak in a red wine reduction sauce with mushrooms and layered potatoes. I also tried the steak frites cooked to perfection with a sour cream and chive topping. The fries were even amazing.\n\nTo finish it off, the brownie bites were mini lava cakes topped with a pistacio ice cream and the sorbet. Well, it was just the sweetest end to an already perfect meal.\n\nI'll definitely be frequenting the Bouchon in Yountville."

S"Originally I come from around the Napa area and there's one name that rings loud when it comes to fine dining. That name is Thomas Keller. One of the things that always seems to shine through about his restaurant is the simple fact that he cares. He cares about the food and he cares about his employees. That fact is reflected in every one of his restaurants.\n\nWhat can I say about the food that the previous thousand reviewers have not. The food is spectacular. I've dined here on a number of occasions and have yet to be the slightest bit disappointed in what I have order. The most recent time I dined here I had the Roulette aux Deux Saumon to start, followed by the Moulles aux Saffron. Let me tell you, the roulette is one of the most spectacular things I have ever eaten. Something so simple has no business being as good as it is. The mussels were nothing to scoff at either. Very delicate, yet flavorful, which was exactly what I was going for after many nights of heavy drinking. \n\nThe service when I came here was phenomenal. So here is my sad little story. I came to dine here by myself as I had an entire day to kill in Vegas before my flight. Often times I feel uncomfortable being a mid-twenties guy eating by myself. I feel that people look at me funny, but not here. The wait staff did an excellent job of engaging with me on a personal as well as professional level. The service was extremely attentive, but not overbearing. They really know how to balance it here. Their intuitiveness is something that I have rarely seen at many restaurants. They seemed to know exactly what I was going to ask for next and already had it prepared. \n\nTwo drinks, an appetizer, and main course ran me about $110 after tax and tip. I feel that price was justified considering what I got out of it. What people often forget about dining is that the price is not just about the food, its about the experience. The experience I had here has only served to solidify that Thomas Keller is my favorite restaurateur. Thank you Bouchon.  \n\nPS: The baked goods are delicious."

S'Everything on the menu is stellar.  This restaurant is the only place in the world that literally brought me to tears because the food was so good.  What was so good I cried, you ask? \n1. Duck Leg confit with cherries\n2. Frisee Salad with poached egg and lardon, when I cut into the egg and the yolk coated the frisee creating the most perfect, velvety dressing, a lone tear fell from my eye....maybe because of the vodka too (I admit, I get gushy after a martini and cry when I\'m happy) but they were so good, we ordered one more of each.  \n\nThis was before dinner. \n\nI\'ve had one of the best steaks in my life here.  The frites are, as Anthony Bourdain says..."the best in the world." \nThe oysters are clearly the pick of the harvest.  Direct to Keller first.  Get the Island Creeks. \n\nA good friend knows the manager, so we were bombarded with anything and everything we could possibly want, and then some.  A tour of the kitchen straight out of Ratatouille, before we ate dessert.  \nI really can\'t say anything bad about this place, it\'s a destination of itself and worth a trip to Vegas. \n\nI could go on and on, but you should go yourself and order everything you want...I will probably be the best version of that dish you will ever have in your life...and maybe you too, will shed a tear.'

S"Oh, Bouchon. I love you oh so much. We usually pick one schmancy dinner during a Vegas trip, and since I'm not one for the over-the-top fancy $500 per person dinners, Bouchon suited me just fine.\n\nFirst of all, I realize you're supposed to order wine with all things Frenchy, but I've gotta say the cocktails at Bouchon are spectacular. Supremely amazing. I had a Bulleit Old Fashioned - and it was one helluva Old Fashioned.\n\nOf course the service is more than superb. And makes you really feel like it's worth every penny that you're spending. \n\nThe food? Ah. Delicious. I never ever get chicken at a restaurant, but something about the chicken on the menu at Bouchon struck my fancy. And I ordered right. That roast chicken was just superb. So amazing perfect. \n\nLike I said worth every penny. Sure, it's not quite as pricey as some of the places on the strip (at around $80-$100 p/p), but you'll be in store for a fantastic dinner, that's for certain."

S"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with a party of 5 around noon and were quoted a 40 minute wait and were pleasantly surprised that it only turned into a half an hour. Definitely do-able. The place is super cute and very french bistro like, very authentic to some of the places we ate in Paris. And it was kinda big in size which is necessary for the demand of people that come here. It's kinda tucked away downstairs in the Venetian but there are signs everywhere so you won't get lost. I loved all the cute pictures on the top walls of random french stuff, very adorable for people like me who appreciate pleasant ambiance.\n\nNow onto the food, I was kinda worried since I'm more of a lunch, dinner person than a brunch person but the menu was pretty good. I had the special butternut squash soup which was simply delicious and fresh. The happy bread that comes complimentary on the weekend with french butter and strawberry jam left me very happy and super full as we could not stop ourselves. My husband had the omelette du jour which he seemed to enjoy with a side of bacon that I helped myself to as well  which was delicious. We also had the pommes frites which were some of the best I've ever had. I dipped them in mayo and jam, and both were just to die for. I'm dreaming about those pommes frites. Friends had the lox and cream cheese, mussels and other brunch items and everything looked and smelled fabulous. A must go to place in Vegas especially for brunch. The walk from Aria and the wait was well worth it."

S'Fancy French breakfast cuisine? Why not?\n\nI guess I had too much expectation for Bouchon which leads to it\'s now mediocre review. I wanted to love it, but I found it to be just "OK". Nothing too special. I have to say, being a french fry lover...their fries were on point. \n\nWe waited maybe a good half hour before being seated on a Saturday afternoon. Yeah, we\'re not early birds. After being seated and ordered, our waitress came back to warn us that they might be out of chicken and waffles. TRES TRAGIQUE. (I\'ve never taken a french class excuse me) Luckily, we got our chicken though! It was a nice spin of the usual fried chicken and waffles. The waffles were infused with bacon bits and the chicken was nice and juicy. I had the ham and cheese grilled sandwich type deal with an egg. It had a gravy cream sauce on top which made it nice and hearty. I liked it, but half way through I was getting bored of it. Tasty nonetheless?\n\nOverall, food is okay. Nice ambiance.

Once seated our waiter gave us our menus but did not in any other way acknowledge us.  When we asked him a question about the Rillettes aux deux Saumons, he decided to correct us on our incorrect pronounciation of Rillettes in a rude snotty tone.  Then gave us a look and explained how it was prepared.  Throughout the meal, I looked around and saw other very friendly waiters waiting on other tables.  Our waiter was not attentive, would walk by and ignore us.  Also, he never smiled.  Not once.  He made it seem like we offended him somehow.\n\nOkay, I understand..the French are rude but we are not in France and he was not French.  He only seemed to try and redeem himself at the very end when he said "hope you enjoyed your dinner."  \n\nI ordered the Steak Frites (medium rare).

S'Uncut pandemonium. I saw red in all directions, my defenses bathed external pawns in vulnerability ink as i masticated morsels of choreographed grace. I was always captivated by the Keller output, i live nearby the ole francais cleaners, but 500 bucks a person? No culinary prostitute can yank away that many bones from me. Even if they\'re the true conduit of god, even if it is has something to do with france. \n\nSo, I have the most powerful yelper of all to thank. Her and I were gearing up for this moment throughout our entire sabbatical together. She was aware of what was to come, as i swathed myself in a predictably unctuous cynical grue that was quickly sopped up with the towel of reality. \n\nHence exclaiming "toodles" towards my formerly jingoistic wee-gan leanings, i thought i would make things interesting, perhaps invite a finned unit (or posse) to my reckless acute dash towards the questionably hued gates of lucid bliss.\n\nSo, we started with sweet beignets. They were noticeably akin to an uglier cousin of the pastry world (hint: sheepishly oval, sans center, adored by a character who\'s first name ends in -omer) but certainly evolved into the respectable kind of gem with its delicate spicing, disconcertingly controlled flake and sumptuous mahogany flesh. Oh, forgot to mention the from-scratch nutella that pompously walloped all dangling, whittling stoics. Just in time for the Truite aux Amandes! (Pan-roasted trout with haricots verts,almonds & beurre noisette) \n\nAnd that\'s the end of the food discussion. I don\'t want to use the constraints of language to pointlessly expound on experiences that tapped into multiple dimensions, ulterior states of being and possible dips into unutterable puddles of the unknown. Bouchon\'s  target directive hinges on ferocious cultivation of threadbare necessity to perpetually extract endless distinct, complicated conclusions upon a single item. Sometimes dishes will only consist of four ingredients. I felt like pulling a Johnny Depp in "Once upon a time in Mexico". Thankfully, I understand perspective. And have no desire for stasis. \n\nThanks, gurl!  The search is over.\n\nOh, and this was merely brunch.'

S'I was so very excited to eat at a Thomas Keller restaurant! What a complete disappointment.\n\nThe place was empty at dinner, and that should have told me something.\n\nI was seated outside and provided two "vines" of bread with butter & a small bowl of pistachios. One of the stars I\'m giving is for the butter, which was the perfect texture & consistency. I ate the bread, which was hard and stale, primarily for the butter.\n\nAs a first course, they were doing an off-menu special of Fruits De Mer, which the waiter described as a take on bouillabaisse. Small bowl of bland, bland, bland, flavorless tomato water with the most tender seafood I have ever out in my mouth. The squid and octopus were the most incredible texture, which sadly was not complemented by the rest of the dish. Accompanied by a "crostini" which was an untested slice of stale bread slathered with an average aioli. The seafood accounts for the second star.\n\nI ordered the lamb for a main. I love lamb, and eat it on the rare side...but not the purple side. Totally undercooked, poorly seared, and just rubbery.it was served with undercooked peas and some tasty square of an unidentified food that may have been potato. The lamb was inedible and I sent it back. Got another one that was almost as rare and completely gristly, rubbery and inedible. And completely oversalted. That was it, I sent it back and checked out.\n\nThomas Keller has the reputation of being a perfectionist - that\'s his brand. I felt this was very much a case where a celebrity chef has lent their name to a restaurant that they haven\'t set foot in since it opened. I cannot believe that Keller would, for even a moment, allow the horrible food that came out of that kitchen to bear his name.\n\nAt least I hope not.\n\nSo many great dining choices in Vegas. Skip this one for one where the chef is actually aware of the food being sent out.'

S"I came here for brunch TWICE while on business.  \n\nService was generally slow and the food was generally good but doesn't warrant the hype.  I've sampled the following:\n\nCroque Madame: Good but greasy\nLobster Eggs Benedict Special: Yum but the server did forget to ask for the hollondaise to be put on the side\nPain au chocolat: Yum, but I've had better elsewhere (the little pastry shop outside Macy's Mens at South Coast Plaza - forget the name of the shop)\n\nI would expect a better level of service and food with a restaurant attached to the Thomas Keller name and expect that this place is going to turn into those chains (like what Emeril and Bobby Flay already have) because it brings in the MONEY!"

S"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! Thomas Keller, you are amazing. This is a MUST try brunch place in Vegas; I will take this quality food over 3+ hours of waiting for a buffet anyday. And this being my second Thomas Keller experience, and just as good as the first (Fleur de Lys, San Francisco), I am determined to try every Thomas Keller restaurant possible in my lifetime.\n\nWe had a 10-15 minute wait on a Saturday morning Christmas, but it was nice because we lounged around and looked at their menu beforehand. We did have a service problem. But I still gave them 5 stars for the way they remedied it. They brought out one of our orders before the other... WAY before. I think we waited a good 15 minutes for our present order to get cold before the other one came out. However, like all top-notch French restaurants, impeccable service rendered the mistake to practically nothing. The service:\n\n- waiter apologized many times\n- brought out assorted fruit plated in a cup by the chef\n- offered us drinks from the bar on the house\n- the restaurant manager herself brought out the dish and apologized\n- the dish was put on the house, cutting our bill in half\n\nService, service, service. They are AHHHMAZING, polite, speedy, attentive, and friendly. Except for that period of time where our waiter was a bit MIA, everything else was flawless.\n\nI was a bit skeptical about their chicken and waffle, because... chicken and waffles? Thomas Keller? Most popular item on the menu? ...uhh, come again?\n\nI was very happily proven wrong when we ordered it anyways. Chicken is usually too dry and waffles are usually too sweet. This chicken... I don't think I've tasted chicken so flavorful WITHOUT the gravy or waffles so flawlessly textured and flavored... add some of their gravy to your chicken, and some butter and syrup to your waffles... I could die eating this for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day for the next year.\n\nI got the crab special... I forgot what it was called, but it was a weekend special of crab, macaroni, and cheese, baked and topped with scrambled eggs and black truffle hollandaise sauce (black truffle anything, HOLLA!). I ate every bite even when I was stuffed up to my esophagus because it was that good.\n\nGet their orange juice, by the way. Super fresh and a perfect balance of flavor to your meal. Judging by the flavor of the orange juice, I'd assume their mimosas to be great as well.\n\nAmbience was wonderful. This restaurant is located near the Venetian hotel check in. You take a separate elevator up to a different, more secluded lobby by the pool, and the decor inside the restaurant is classic and has windows that look out to scenery.\n\nGreat service, nice ambience, and AMAZING food... I will most definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.\n\nPsst... check out Bouchon Bakery downstairs after your brunch and take something to go. You won't regret it!"

S'I\'d been meaning to take my boyfriend to a nice meal since he always treats me.  I chose Bouchon because most people I\'ve talked to raves about Thomas Keller and his establishments, and its location was convenient.\n\nI made a reservation well in advance (like in Jan, and we dined here 2/16) and snatched a nice table for two at 7:00pm.  Our waiter was very nice and knowledgeable and made our dining experience very enjoyable.  I loved that the restaurant was open and airy and BIG, and doesn\'t give off that claustrophobic and dark vibe many French restaurants tend to give off. The menu wasn\'t this big, stuffy, heavy book but was instead doubled as a napkin holder, made of a thin piece of paper. Clever.  \n\nAfter we had heard all the specials, I decided on the french onion soup and crispy sea bass in a creamy sauce made of chives with crepes of parsnip.  Bf opted for the steak frites.  His steak frites were about the best steak frites I\'ve ever tasted.  French onion soup was PERFECT......perfect cheese, perfect soup, perfect in every way.  My fish was indeed crispy and tender and delicious, but somehow lacking that "wow" factor I was looking for. Maybe because the parsnips crepes were kinda bleeechhhhh.\n\nService, as I expected was top-notch, especially the water/drinks waiter.  He deserves 5 stars for his attentiveness and consideration.\n\nDessert: really really good.  we had the tropical sundae which was a medley of sorbets: cherry, mango, and coconut, bathing in a tangy tropical "soup" and topped with fruits (raspberries, kiwis, mangoes).  Absolutely delish.\n\nOverall, I\'d like to give it five stars, because the food, service, and price were all very impressive.  The atmosphere of the place was also very nice.  But somehow it\'s just lacking in something that I can\'t quite put my finger on.  Maybe next time after I try their brunch I will give them five stars, but for now, I\'m going to save room for them to impress a little more.'

Allow me to stress the fact that the best appetizer is the pork cheeks...at first glance I was hesitant but once you see it on your plate mixed with the smell of the onions, your jaw just drops!\n\nMy entree: Steak Frites! \nEnough said! A huge steak with a more than generous side of fries!\n\nIf for some reason you don't like this place, you should have yourself checked out...because you are the Antichrist!"

S'Napa location is on a different level compared to Vegas. The food and service at the bar were both a little rough. Our server/bartender completely forgot about us several times and we had to reorder a few times as well. In addition, I overheard the bartender blame the chef for an error in food to a customer. I thought that was very unprofessional. Quality of the food did not seem up to par from my previous experiences in Napa.'

S'Concluded our most recent Vegas adventure with brunch at Bouchon. Non existent wait time during a Monday afternoon. \n\nI believe Riley was our server, wish I was a hundred percent on his name as we definitely wanted to note his level service. He was funny, utmost honest and very accommodating. We requested a table change and serval order alterations as well in which he addressed on a positive note with good humor. \n\nMenu offerings were all mouth watering, our  ordered dishes were even more delicious! I had the corned beef hash, side of potato croquettes accompanied by a bloody mary. Portions were particularly large and made the travel trek to be served as breakfast for the following morning back home. \n\nDining in gained us a 15% treat receipt at the strip bakeries.'

S"My family and I dined here on Friday April 12th for dinner and I must say I was extremely disappointed.  We were deciding between Bouchon, American Fish, and Bartolotta.  However, two members of our party had dined at Bouchon and suggested it.  \n\nWe had an 8:30pm reservation and arrived about 20 minutes early to have a drink or two at the bar.  It was pretty packed so we grabbed a bar table in the bar area.  Not once did a server come by to bring us water or take a drink order.  We went up to the hostess to express our concern and see if they could send someone over to help us.  Before anyone came by, the hostess came and escorted us to our table outside on the patio.  She was aware of the situation so we assumed that our service from that point on would be impeccable. Boy were we wrong!\n\nOnce seated at our table, another 15 minutes passed before or waiter even came by to greet us.  We had to flag down a bus boy for waters!  Upon our waiter visiting, he was friendly and warm but it did not make up for the start of the meal.  They had a few specials on the menu where one struck our immediate interest.  However, when we went to order it, the kitchen was out of it.\n\nMoving on to the food.  We ordered the salmon rillette appetizer which was delicious.  We also each ordered the endive salad per our waiter's recommendation.  It was tasty but nothing extraordinary.  I have had many better salads in my day for half the cost.  For our entrees, we ordered the chicken, salmon, and trout.  All were very tasty but nothing to rave about.  I was expecting much more from Thomas Keller. \n\nBack to the service.  We had ordered the Pommes Frittes as a side dish.  A very simple side dish we presumed.  However, it never came.  When we asked our waiter about the status of the dish, he said it is on his way.  However, having been a waiter for a fine dining establishment, I can pick up on when a waiter messes up and when the kitchen messes up.  Immeditaley after I ask about the status of our fries, he ran to the computer and began inputing what I presume was the fries.  To make a long story short, after much reassurence they were coming, they never came.  \n\nWe finally had enough and decided to call over the manager to make her aware of our experience.  She seemed very sorry and apologized but only proceeded to take off our apps and drinks from the bill.  You would think that our meal would have been taken care of.  Lastly, we were celebrating two birthdays that weekend in Vegas and I made Bouchon aware when we made our res.  However, they did nothing to acknowledge that.  \n\nOverall a very dissapointing experience.  With all of the great restaurants in Vegas, I will never be returning to Bouchon and I suggest you check out many of the better offerings of Sin City."

I had the salmon with peas and wild mushrooms, hubby had a croque madam with fries and sister had mussels with fries.  I have NEVER seen so many fries on one table - must remember never to order extra fries here! \n\nThat said, everything was cooked beautifully and I enjoyed every morsel of my dinner.  \n\nNo complaints - it's a lovely place to eat in Vegas (and especially if you're staying in the Venetian, then it's very convenient!)"

It was about 12:30 so we had the brunch.  Very short wait for a table. We got seated outside in this lovely courtyard which really added to our experience.  We ordered the following:\n\nCroque Madame\nWaffles\nBreakfast special with french toast\nBloody Mary \nGin Fizz\n\nFunny story on the gin fizz's....apparently bartender had never made before but he was more then willing to learn and along the way, our friends said they were the best they had ever had! We were very happy with the service, found them to be just the right amount of attentive and the food....delicious.  I have never had Frites so perfectly seasoned before in my life and the Croque Madame was heavenly, especially if you had the egg on top over easy so that when you cut into it, the yolk just blends wonderfully with the bechamel.  I saw a review on here that said the bechamel was too creamy.  Ummm....it's bechamel!!  Simply divine.    Also, most delicious Bloody Mary I have ever had.\n\nWe were quite pleased and I for one can't wait to get back here for a different meal to try.

S"My recent meal at Bouchon was mostly excellent, with great food and  table service. My party started with cocktails, which were both subtly flavored and high quality, as expected. After a brief designated waiting period (the restaurant was half-empty), we were seated and attended to by our very good waiter. The menu here is traditional french, and we opted for a variety of dishes, ranging from simple trout amandine to luxurious steak diane (the special). We paired our food with a Cru Beaujolais recommended by our waiter (it was very good). The food was also quite good, although nothing blew me away. \n\nOverall, I was very satisfied with my meal, and especially so with the table service. However, I'm not sure the experience added up to the outlay, which came to a cool hundred per head. For that kind of cash, I expect the ultimate, and Bouchon fell just shy of my favorite fine dining experiences for some reason."

S"Food was very good, but the portions sizes were inconsistent.  Those of us that ordered halibut received mildly small portions.  Someone in our party said that the halibut was good but not the best she's ever had, as the waiter guaranteed everything to be.  The waiter tried to milk that response out of her, because he wanted everything to be perfect, but she relented - good service, nonetheless.  The wine we got was medium-pricey and was ok, but not memorable. \n\nI suppose what makes this place is the history behind it.  Awesome cooks, restaurants like French Laundry, your food being harvested and flown in the same day from all over the country, etc.  I had the veal special and the portion was ridiculous (should have shared between two!) which cost marginally more than the teeny halibut.  Quality is top-notch but there's little/no flavoring added, just the pure taste of unadulterated meat.  The truffle fries were thin and cooked with a light crisp and also had very good, original pure flavoring .  Great food and probably suited to satisfy purists.  I personally prefer more spices and sauces so it was short of a hole-in-one for me, but I appreciate the quality put into it."

The menu comes wrapped around your napkin in a folded paper.  Out waiter was nice, but a little over the top for us and was a bit chatty.  Some people might like that, but not our group.  It made it a bit awkward for us.\n\nI started with the beet salad and a selection of oysters.  The salad was yummy and the oysters were a fair selection from the waters of the north pacific.  I've had a better selection with better condiments to go with them.  The wine was fair, but I'm always trying new things and the waiter didn't have much input in my selection.  I had the lamb for my main entree and even though it was a smaller sized portion it still had a lot of great flavor.  You don't get that gamey taste, but just a full savory one.  The steak my gf had was delicious with the smothered butter and caramelized onions.  For dessert we had the profiteroles, which was a-ok.  Nothing like the foie gras profiteroles we had at le pigeon in portland, but just ok.\n\nWould I go back?  Most likely, but I'm sure to try out some other places before doing so."

The latter blew me away whereas, Bouchon was excellent but unremarkable.  \n\nI had the chicken and waffles, which were superb and the waffles threw me for a happy loop with the bacon specks cooked in and the flavored butter.  Other folks in our family had rave reviews for the Tartine de Thon, Bouchon French Toast, and trout dish.  Gravlax and Croque de Madame were said to be good.\n\nService staff was very nice, though remarkably slow in their execution.\n\nCouple criticisms: \n(1) Service was exceptionally slow!  Ordering took about 25 minutes.  It was about 50 minutes before food was on the table.  And paying was the equivalent of a race with your chunky buddy on your back.  All in all, our dining experience took about 2.5 hours.  \n(2) The Bouchon Pastry Basket was grocery store caliber.  Two of the flavors came back as unavailable.  Then, when the platter did arrive, they all had cold centers.  Seriously, for $13 for four pastries, I would expect thorough reheating.\n(3) We sat in the back right and with things taking so long, the sun was hitting us hard.  My cousin and I started eating lunch with our sunglasses on.  As the temperature on my phone crossed 90-degrees, I called over the staff and asked to either move or have them pull some kind of shade.  They kindly put an outside umbrella against the window which helped greatly.  They were very kind in responding.  I would have liked it more if they had thought ahead reacted to our discomfort without being asked.  We aren't the only ones who have eaten at the table.\n\nIn sum, excellent food, slow service, nice staff, a few knocks on food preparation, and a some small doubts on quality for the price."

He came up with this word after he and my friend went to Las Vegas for a few days, and if there ever was one word to capture the essence of Sin City, I would place my vote for this one. \n\nBouchon, however, is one of the places in Las Vegas where you don\'t have to rub shoulders with The Rest of Them.  Just put your head down as you go past all the slots in the Venetian and get to the elevator as fast as possible, and then you get to walk into the restaurant with perfectly tinkling water glasses, Massive Attack at ideal volume in the background, and some really really fabulous French bistro eats.  I went there with two friends for dinner.\n\n+Cocktail: Brigitte Bardot (Spanish calvados, Campari, cassis, apple juice)\n+Plate du Fromage: Tomme du Dauphine, Rogue River Blue, Black Gold with sliced fuji apples and New Zealand honeycomb\n+Salade de Poires, Noisette et Roquette (bosc pear salad with hazelnut brittle, arugula, and pear vinaigrette)\n+Moules au Safran et a la Moutarde (Maine bouchot mussels steamed in white wine, mustard, and saffron served with pommes frites)\n+Profiteroles with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce\n+Port: 1970 Delaforce\n\nDon\'t forget, kids, that Anthony Bourdain went to Bouchon with the express purpose of dumping on their pommes frites-- after all, Tony and Les Halles are supposed to have the drop on fries-- and he takes one bite of the fries and mutters, "fuck."

The interior is a little bit Balthazar in Soho, the service fantastic and the food delicious and inventive.  \n\nBread came out warm with soft enough butter (pet peeve is butter that is too cold and you can't spread it nicely on your bread until it warms to room temperature!).  Our mimosas held us over nicely while waiting anxiously for our food.\n\nI had a hard time deciding between the Croque Madame and the Scallop Gratin.  I finally chose the Scallop Gratin as it was a special and I'm sure i wouldn't order it ordinarily.  The dish was supremely creamy with the most tender and perfectly cooked scallops.  Leeks were a nice addition to the seafood flavor as well as the perfect amount of thick cut bacon chunks, not too much to overtake the flavor, but just enough to cut the rich creamy sauce.  \n\nTobin's Chicken and Waffles were better than my entree, i have to say.  The waffles were cooked to a outside crunch, with inner softness.  Cooked inside the waffle were bacon pieces and green onion.   Pepper butter accompanied the waffles as well as syrup.  The chicken was a half chicken served with a tasty gravy of bacon deliciousness.  The combination of sweet and savory was amazing and just kept getting better as the meal wore on.\n\nService was impeccable and perfectly timely.

You can't go wrong having a meal here.\n\nBouchon is open till 2 for brunch on the weekends. They were nice and let us eat at the bar at 1:58pm:) My sourdough waffles were awesome! Seriously, so awesome and served with real maple syrup and vanilla infused butter. There is an extensive list of champagne cocktails to ease that Vegas hangover too:)\n\nFor dinner, you have to go with the steak frites. High-end french bistro food done right!"

S"This is by far my husband and my favorite restaurant on the strip and in Vegas in general since we moved here back in September. We have only been there for breakfast but it is amazing every single time so we can't help but find ourselves going back. \n\nEverything that you are served is fantastic which I find is rare when it comes to restaurants. From the bread and homemade jam to start your meal to the fresh squeezed juices and homemade pastries to the sourdough french toast or fresh omelets - we never go home hungry or unhappy. Whenever we have visitors in town we are sure to take them to Bouchon for breakfast."

S'Bouchon is open for brunch Saturdays and Sundays with a menu that features a mix of Thomas Keller breakfast and lunch  inspired dishes. The fiance and I did a power wake-up early Sunday morning to ensure  non-queue walk-in status. Boom. We were seated right away and started our morning the correct way with coffee and bellinis. The coffee, referred to as "a medium roast European blend" was exceptionally smooth. The bellinis were of the classic nature, with peach nectar, bubbly and a raspberry floater - juicy and refreshing. To go with our beverages, we ordered a few pastries. The featured beignets, filled with fresh raspberry pur\xc3\xa9e, were good, although I was expecting that hot-cooked dough sensation as opposed to something that had been made a few hours ago. We also ordered a pumpkin muffin (before the squash goes extinct for the next 10 months, which we ended up saving for a to-go snack to make room for the mains). \n\nAn epi baguette was delivered to our table escorted by fresh butter and strawberry preserves. The bread had a pleasantly crunchy crust and a chewy crumb to it. \n\nChicken and Waffles. The bacon-chive waffles were that savory sweet species. You know those mornings where you can\'t decide if you\'re feeling like something sweet and charming or like something meaty that will power you through for the rest of the day? These waffles help make that decision for you: drool inducing hits of bacon and a little tang from the chive all smoothed out with sweet waffle batter which is improved in it entirety with Tahitian vanilla bean butter served on the side. The chicken is roasted as opposed to the classical fried chicken and waffles combination. The end result deemed to be juicy and flavorful.\n\nQuiche Due Jour: which apparently happens to be Florentine more often than not at the Vegas location. I am most likely ruined from all other quiches after this one with its healthy dose of spinach and garlic suspended in creamy custard bordered by a flaky buttery crust. A perfectly made quiche. The salad was coated in a red wine (read: raw onion) vinaigrette - buyer beware - my head turned in to a breathing onion odorizer. A shot of listerine should be served upon completion of this dish. Or maybe Thomas Keller just wants to leave a lasting impression. Nonetheless it was a fantastic meal and I would gladly return for brunch at any of their locations I happen to be.'

S'After meeting Chef Keller at a book signing and reading all the cookbooks, I was super excited to have made reservations to dine at Bouchon. and the experience will go down as one of my best meals of the year. the service was on point and the food was just yummy galore. started with escargot and was happy to see little puff pastries on them. I had a slow smoked brisket and my best friend and the short ribs and we both were so pleased with the tenderness of the meat and flavors we did not speak for a while as we both were eating. ordered up some different sides, pomme frites were pretty good as expected as well as the glazed carrots were standard and tried the hen of the woods which we both liked. of course you must have dessert at Bouchon and so we went with the profiteroles and we were so happy we barely made it out of our chairs when we were done. very very good experience for any foodie to make if you cannot make it to the french laundry. good starting point for a nice preparation for the pilgrimage to french laundry.'

S'Bouchon Bistro, in the Venetian, is Thomas Keller\'s Las Vegas presence. Judging from the google results and "Bouchon Las Vegas dress code" being a popular suggested search, there\'s some confusion about this bistro. It\'s relatively casual, but chic. It\'s decorated like an old French bistro, and the menu reflects its casual but traditional nature.\n\nHis plate: Steak Frites - pan-seared prime flat iron served with ma\xc3\xaetre d\'h\xc3\xb4tel butter and frites\n\nHer plate: Sourdough Waffles - sourdough waffles with bananas, toasted walnuts, maple syrup, & Tahitian vanilla bean butter; cappuccino; mimosa\n\nTo share:  Beignets with chocolate and fruit dipping sauces; side of bacon\n\nThe bread for the table was beautiful and fresh, nice mini leaves of thoroughly authentic and crusty French bread. Our beignets came out hot and fresh, very dense and covered in cinnamon sugar. The dipping sauces were chocolate (that may have had a hint of hazelnut) and strawberry/raspberry.\n\nD\'s steak was good, though he was disappointed that the fries weren\'t house-made or more special. My waffles were fantastic - and the combination of the vanilla bean butter and the walnuts were really delicious. The syrup was not really needed at all, but I did appreciate that it was served warm.'

S'"Boo chon to the couchon"\n\nGood but not amazing. I hate to air some French Laundry here, but to be honest I was not impressed with Mr. Keller\'s extension into Vegas. I  am worshipper of all thing Keller, but maybe that hype over played what we ate. The ambiance is very Vegas and over the top. But I never go to a place for the ambiance alone. I go there because I am hungry and my taste buds tell me so. Taste buds say - salty with a chance of mediocrity. It was a good steak, and the fries were a highlight and if I could combine Bouchon fries with a double In-and-Out burger, I would call it a day and save the calories on all of the other "French" delectables. But, the food overall was so salty that I felt like a camel that has been wandering the Sahara for months. The veal appetizer with the lentils were amazing! Pate? Salt lick wrapped in bacon and more salt liverishness. The oysters seemed fresh, but maybe the thought of being in the desert and having witnessed first hand what Seattle has to offer, I would save the airline fare and just fly to Seattle and find a place having happy hour by the piers. \n\nSorry, Bouchon is good, but for the amount we spent and the hype. Epic fail.'

Got a seat on the patio with a view of... well, middle aged women in one piece swim suits? WTF? I tried to focus on closer surroundings. \n\nI had french toast - a very unexpected presentation. A cylindrical tower of brioche, custard and apples. Very tasty and quite filling.\n\nMy wife had the most excellent Croque Madame. But as far as I am concerned, the star of the show was the French Fries. Possibly the best I've ever had.\n\nService was perfect. All and all a perfect Sunday morning."

S"Love. Love. Love.\n\nBest baked eggs.  Ever.  Breakfast was amazing.  We had the baked eggs and also the quiche.  The quiche was out of this world.  Fluffy and delicious.  We also ordered the donuts (beignets), which were excellent.  They came with a cherry sauce and a chocolate sauce, which were good, but seriously, I thought the donuts by themselves were delicious.\n\nThey also have a bakery in front of the Phantom Theatre.  It's kind of hidden behind an escalator, but please search it out!  The strawberry croissant  was so good you must try it.\n\nWe loved the breakfast at Bouchon so much we went back the next day for dinner.  For the exact same price we spent in Mesa Grill (Bobby Flay's restaurant, also in Venetian), Bouchon is a notch above.  The ambiance, the service, and OH, the FOOD!  We had the steak frites and roast chicken.  French bistro dining at its best."

S'This was my one and only real meal in Vegas during an intense weekend outing. Even though I felt extremely sick during my meal, I still really liked it (I love food in general)!! We went for "brunch" at noon and left at 3pm!\n\nI got chicken and waffles. It\'s not a great thing to get when you\'re hung-over but it really is delicious. Its a little heavy (the gravy you pour on the chicken is heavy) and the waffles have little salty pieces of bacon on it, but it is DELICIOUS. I especially like the combo flavor of sweet syrup and salty chicken. The chicken was also super tender, probably some of the most tender I\'ve ever had...\n\nI tried my friend\'s croque madame and it was DELICIOUS as well. The brioche bread was buttery and delicious and the ham was a good salty contrast. The french fries were amazing as well (probably some of the best fries I\'ve ever had).\n\nI got a chocolate croissant which was amazing (honestly everything was amazing) and the bread they serve you is great too. Desert was even better! We got 7 deserts and I think I tried all of them. The best were a creme puff / ice cream pastry thingy, chocolate cake thingies (so good!!), and the lemon tart. The flan was good, but i didnt have a lot. I didnt like the custard that much.\n\nThis meal was amazing AND I was feeling realy sick (so this should underscore how amazing the meal was). I honestly wish I felt better so I could have enjoyed it more. Must come back!!'

S'I finally made it back to Bouchon and this time for brunch.\nIt was the best breakfast I had on this trip...er, although I as subject to convention food breakfast, so relatively speaking it honestly doesn\'t take much to be a best breakfast.\n\nThat\'s not to say the food was bad. No, it was very very good.\n\nOur waiter, whose name I do not recall sadly, led us through some recommendations that we were very happy with.\n\n* Sweetbreads to start. Mmm, glands. It was on the specials chalkboard.\n* Pan roasted trout, piled with vegetables. With clear eyes on the fish head. Fresh!\n* Chicken and waffles. Yummy. Is it really French? Do I care?\n\nAnd lots of coffee. \n\nDefinitely the priciest of breakfasts, and worth it.\n\nWe admired the selection of absinthe at the bar, and also the good beers on tap. \n\nI couldn\'t really feel any "food magic" in the space. It felt like the typical good food decadence I feel in the strip area of Vegas.  But if I can walk into a restaurant, see the food I\'m eating, and dine without hearing the endless bings and bonks of casino machines, I\'m pretty happy.\nService and food can\'t be faulted for anything, for my experience. But I was bummed that the people at two small tables nearby me seemed unhappy. One duo effectively dined alone, as their food arrived 15 minutes apart and there was never a time they had food together on the table. Another, um, gererously portioned couple seemed unhappy with the size of their meals. \nSince casinos are probably not very far away from handing out collectible feed sacks to strap to our faces in the buffets, I leave it to the latter couple to sort out what best meets their dining expectations.  For the former, the management came and resolved the issue as best they could and I admire the duo for leaving the waiter a very generous tip, as the timing of the food preparation was not his fault.\n\nI\'ve done a dinner here, as well as a brunch. It was very good, but I probably don\'t need to return for a meal. Bouchon has kind of blown its wad and I don\'t get the impression that an encore is necessary.\nMaybe for some absinthe, or a pastry from the bakery.'

S"Pretty place, but pretty overrated.  I wanted to love it as I heart the strawberry croissant he has in his bakery, but breakfast at Bouchon was pricey and so average.  \nMy quiche was dry and had too much of an egg taste.  I know, it is a quiche - what did I expect!?!  My fault for ordering it and trying to order something new.  The french toast was too fancy in a layered circle ring.  It was more like dessert and not at all breakfast-like.  The lobster egg benedict was good.  My uncle took off ALL the wild mushrooms as they tasted 'weird'.    I guess fancy food is lost on me.  However, the Croque Madame was the WINNER - ham and cheese on brioche with a fried egg topped with some kinda creme sauce and fries on the side.   That was the BEST dish of all.   \n\nThe our server was a bit haughty and answered our questions with a straight face - no smile - no small talk.  She gave us our bill without a pen and made a face when I asked for one.   \n\nNext time I'll hit the coffee cart by the escalators and get a Bouchon strawberry croissant at a very small fraction of the price of brunch."

My steak was overcooked and my husband can make a better beef bourguignon at home. Again, it is a good restaurant but given the price, the crowded dining area (tables are very close to one another so its not very intimate), and the quality of the food, I would never consider this to be a 5 star restaurant.

S"New addtions:  We went here for breakfast, and this is A MUST.  Their brioche toast is perfect, though the service was a bit slow and confused.\n\nWhy not 5 stars? Well, not all of the dishes are really 5 star worthy, and it's more of a 4.5 star review, but the two trips to this restaurant were rather different in feel, which leads me to a slightly lower review.\n\nI've now been here twice, and I can safely say, the 2nd time was much much better!  First, never get the gnocchi.  The first time, one of my fellow diners got the gnocchi, and unless you like French gnocchi, you will be confused and disappointed.  The waiter this time talked one of the people I was dining out of the gnocchi, and she should forever be in his debt.\n\nFor starters, we had the cod brandade, which was excellent, their olives, which had a lovely herbal note to them, and the charcuterie platter, which was a little too much sausage, but just wonderful.\n\nWe then had salads, with the warmed goat cheese, which provided a nice sweetness to the bitterness of the salad. It had a touch of fennel in the dressing, which also brought a sweetness to the dish.  It was very well balanced for a salad.  \n\nMy dinner was the flap steak special. It had the thickness of a filet, but about double the size on the actual steak. It was tender like a filet, but juicy like a rib eye.  A fantastic cut of meat, though the swiss chard bed it sat on was rather on the salty side.\n\nWe all had desserts, most getting the chocolate mousse. I personally had the creme caramel, but the table also shared a tarte citron, which was probably the best dessert they offered up.  I highly reccommend going here, and make sure to get a good waiter. The service we had was fantastic! He was funny, light, and kept the dinner fun and relaxing."

S'I recently had the pleasure of spending a great weekend in Vegas, and my visit to Bouchon was a highlight.  I\'ve eaten at quite a few high end restaurants, but Bouchon stands out as having some of the tastiest food I\'ve ever eaten.  We had a reservation for six people and were seated within minutes of arrival.\n\nWe started the meal out with cocktails -- if you haven\'t maxed out on free casino drinks, I would definitely recommend ordering one here, as they have exceptional bartenders.  I had a sazerac on the recommendation of the waiter, and was very pleased.  We also ordered the foie gras appetizer, which was AMAZING.  It was incredibly creamy, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness, and the portion was very generous: it comes in a five oz glass jar, and even with six gluttons eating it, it was more than enough.  A must-order if you have four or more members of your party (and surprisingly thrifty!).  We also split a small order of gnocci, which is not your typical Italian potato dumpling. This gnocci was flour-based, and fried in butter.  It was incredibly rich, so I definitely would advise against ordering it as a main dish; however, as an appetizer it was nice to try.\n\nI split a mixed greens salad with my boyfriend, and this was the only low point in the meal.  By the way, the waiter did the sneaky business of asking "And what salad would you like with that?" as you ordered your entree, making you feel semi-awkward if you didn\'t order one.  I would definitely skip the salads: at around $10 a pop, they are not very tasty.  Our mixed greens salad had a very very sour vinaigrette that made eating the dish rather unpleasant.  The accompanying medallion of goat cheese was so-so, and was too overpowering.  Other people at our table ordered the beet salad which was very pretty, but lacking in flavor.\n\nHowever, the main course more than made up for the subpar salads.  I ordered the lamb, and it was incredibly tender and flavorful.  It came on a bed of peas and mini tokyo turnips, which were not only cute but delicious.  The lamb was quite gamey, but since I\'m a fan of that, it didn\'t bother me.  After finishing our entrees, we were far too full to think of dessert -- but if I ever came back here again, I would skip the salad and get a dessert instead.\n\nOverall, the total bill came to about $70 a person (one cocktail, split small gnocci and foie gras 6 ways, half a salad, one entree, plus tax and tip). Despite the salad being only okay, I left very satisfied with the food, the service, and the restaurant in general.  I would absolutely recommend this place as a splurge during your next Vegas adventure!'

The salad was very good!  The only issue is that it was overly salted! I'm not sure if it's integrated in the vinagrette or if it's sprinkled on?  The goat cheese - DELICIOUS.  I skipped the mixed greens, and ate the goat cheese and bread together instead.\n\nEntree: Poulet Roti (roasted chicken with heirloom squash, rainbow chard, pomegranate seeds and sage infused chicken jus) $29.50.  The chicken is cooked to perfection!  It is so juicy and tender!  The squash is slightly sweet, and is absolutely wonderful, and tasted SO good with the chicken.  \n\nAlong with a glass of sauvignon blanc, the bill came out to be about $60.  It's quite worth it!

We were hungry so we took the high top. Our table overlooked two regular tables for 2 in the restaurant that remained empty literally the entire time we were there. We asked if we could move to one of them, but were told no. So, we just watched empty tables for over one hour. Waiters were totally scattered and overwhelmed in the uncrowded restaurant. I had to get up and get menus because we were not given any, and it took a long time to order, get the check, and pay. We were brought wrong items, and had to ask for coffee and water refills every time. Brunch took nearly two hours with the slow service.

S"BOUchon = BOUrgeois... talk about fine dining... Bouchon is simply amazing!\n\nOn our company trip to Las Vegas this weekend, one of our planned activities was a dinner at Bouchon. There was about 20+ of us, so unfortunately, we had a set menu but the menu was the best of the best they can provide! \n\nFirst course - Corn Soup + Salad. I had the corn soup and I must admit it looked like a full bowl of mustard. Let me just say - it was quite simply AMAZING!!!!!! There was not one person in the house that didn't love it. \n\nMain Course - Steak / Salmon / Chicken. I had the steak and that, too was just decedant! The mashed potatoes were great, and the carmalized onions served on top.............. Ahhhh to die for! \n\nDessert - Caramel Custard or Lemon Tart. I had the caramel, it was good but not my favorite but don't think too much into it as I usually am not a dessert fan. \n\nLastly, to end the evening... we had ABSINTHE DRIP. Yes, the alcohol that is illegal here in the US. It tasted awful, but I did it more so for the experience. \n\nDefinitely try Bouchon if in Vegas, but most fitting for a special occassion (anniversary or birthday, etc). You can thank me later..."

S"We came here for brunch on a Saturday at 11 and surprisingly no line-up - score (or so we thought)!  \n\nOrdered the corned beef hash and some waffles and then waited.... and waited.... and waited.... an hour passes and someone finally comes by to apologize that they lost our order and that they will bring us some pastries to try before we eat.  We wait another half hour before the pastries arrive, and an additional half hour before our meals get to us.  At this point neither of us are hungry anymore, nevertheless we eat.  Waffles were fine, nothing special.  Corned beef hash is is lacking any actual hash.  \n\nWe get the bill and nothing is comp'd. Had we not had to wait so long I probably would have given the place 3 stars but it was definitely not worth the 3 hours and $60 spent here!"

There was this rib thing, I don't even remember what it was called, but I do recall it being probably the single greatest beef experience I'd had in a long time. There was also a layered veal thing, sorry the names elude me, that was just plain great. You can't go wrong here. It's just too good. Too exciting and creative."

S'We were only here for breakfast, but I would have returned for dinner if it weren\'t for our waiter.\n\nThe Food (4 stars):\n\nThough we ordered pretty simple dishes, they were all prepared well. I had the American breakfast (eggs, sausage, bacon, brioche, choice of bakery sweet, coffee and fresh squeezed juice). I forget how much it was, but for all that food I thought it was a decent price. Other items that were ordered were a cheese and mushroom omelette, and wedge salad with a tasty dressing. Everyone really enjoyed their food.\n\n\nService (0 stars):\n\nI was expecting the service to be at least average, if not excellent, at this restaurant, but it was really, really disappointing. I can take some slowness in service, especially at a French restaurant, where it\'s expected and sometimes even preferred. So service was slow, but that\'s not my issue here. \n\nMy waiter was either new or distracted (despite it being uncrowded) or just plain incompetent because:\n\n1) He talks up the strawberry croissants so much that I\'m really looking forward to them but then while I am waiting for my food another server places a sweet cheese pastry in front of me. It\'s definitely not a strawberry croissant, so I ask the server if it\'s something that just comes with my meal. He says yes. I look around and see a bunch of other people with them on their tables, so I just figured it was something extra I didn\'t notice from the menu. End of story. I\'m hungry so I start eating it without my coffee....Wait, why don\'t I have my coffee by now?\n\n2) Because my original server forgets that my meal comes with coffee and juice, and I don\'t see hide nor hair of him until I am almost done with the sweet cheese pastry (I\'ll be getting a strawberry croissant later, after all) when my server pops by to ask how I like the pastry. I tell him it\'s great (it was actually very good), and he says "oh, I\'m so glad you like it--personally, it\'s my favorite. We ran out of strawberry croissants so..." Um yeah, thanks for letting me know earlier. And I\'m glad you made sure I would be ok with the substitution before you did it....Oh wait, no, you didn\'t....And oh, thank you for finally bringing my coffee....Oh, wait, you didn\'t do that either, did you, because you didn\'t even realize it until I brought it up....And what was that? Did you say you were sorry? No, no, you just laughed it off. \n\n3) When do I finally get my coffee? When I\'m almost half-way done with my breakfast. And it\'s brought by a different server. Is my original server avoiding me? I don\'t know. In any case: Booooooo!!!! \n\n4) Despite keeping an eye out for my waiter towards the end of the meal, he has completely dissapeared. Even through another half hour of chatting, I don\'t see a peep of him. I finally flag down a different waiter to ask for the bill. It\'s not so much about the waiting, as where the hell has he been for the last 45 minutes? I only got my first refill on coffee after he brought the bill. After the cup has been sitting empty for well over 20 minutes. WTF? \n\nI usually don\'t bitch about service, but wow, it was so bad it actually affected my dining experience. I\'m sad. I was so looking forward to this restaurant. And the food really was good. Will I ever go back? Maybe. I\'d like to try dinner here sometime. On a sidenote, all of the other guys who serviced the table were professional and lovely. It was just our main waiter that sucked.'

S'We heard that breakfast here was a chance to eat a fairly affordable meal ($15-$22) at a Thomas Keller restaurant.  We came here on a weekday morning just after 9am and were seated promptly with a smile, a few rows away from the small pool outside (the hostess joked that it was the Venetian\'s "kiddie pool").  The restaurant is smaller than I thought it would be, with very high ceilings and an airy, sunlit atmosphere.  \n\nI had the Breakfast Jardiniere with eggs over medium, choosing a chocolate croissant.  It was obvious that the chefs really pay attention to the details.  The croissant came first with a cup of fruit.  Flaky and amazingly buttery, the croissant had delicious bittersweet chunks of chocolate.  Each cube of fruit, whether grape or cantaloupe, was sweet and ripe.\n  The eggs came with a toasted brioche, sauteed spinach, and a side of potatoes cut to the size of nickels.  The eggs were an incredibly deep yellow color (from naturally-raised chickens, perhaps?) that I haven\'t seen from eggs in ages.  The light oil and salt on the potatoes made for a tiny dance of flavor in my mouth.  The sauteed spinach came with big chunks of garlic.  I\'m a real garlic lover, so I actually wanted an even stronger garlic taste from the spinach, but I couldn\'t complain about the tender texture.\n\nI also tried the Oeuf Au Gratin, a deep dish of baked eggs that was a spoonful of richness.  Their coffee was excellent, and their orange juice was very good as well.\n\nI\'m recommending this breakfast to all my friends that are headed to Vegas.  Breakfast service ends at 10:30am I believe, which might be difficult for the night-owl party types in Sin City.'

S'Don\'t consider myself a foodie though I know some of the big names after reading "Kitchen Confidential" and the like.  Went to Vegas for a weekend and knew I had to hit at least ONE famous-chef run place.  Since we were staying at the Venetian and the prices weren\'t too obscene, Bouchon was our choice.\n\nWe had dinner on a Wednesday.  Pretty quiet, presumably due to the mid week timing, and the economy.  Our waiter was French and charming.  I had the steak frites (had to try this famous classic) and my tablemate had the lamb.  For appetizers, we had french onion soup and a mixed green salad.  Desert was lemon tart and the special of the night, little brownie "bouchands" topped with a small scoop of homemade icecream.  To summarize the dinner: delicious.  I thought the steak was a bit bland for my liking but everything else was so perfect, I didn\'t care.\n\nWe returned a couple of days later for brunch and had an equally blissful experience.  Quiche for one of us and the omelette of the day for the other.  Just delicious and filling without being heavy.  The bellinis were a nice refresher to complete the meal.\n\nOverall, a complete pleasure.  Wish it was closer to home (too bad the Bouchon in Northern Calif apparently is suffering many more negative reviews than the Vegas one, unfortunately.)  This is worth anyone\'s time and money, foodie or not.'

S"I'm not sure what's so special about this place. Maybe it's just the ambiance? In other words I hope that dinner was way better then brunch. Our breakfast took a while to get to us, which was fine with us being that brunch ended at 2. But there were no excuses on how the temperature of our bacon should of been.  It's wasn't even consider warm enough to be edible. It seem as though they just left the plate of cooked bacon out for hours then slapped it on the plate. But to sum it all;  Our breakfast pretty much taste as great as dennys. I'm giving it a 3 star because our waiter was nice and for the ambiance. Besides that, their food was a bore."

S'Bouchon is one of our favorites. Whenever we are in Yountville or Vegas, we have to try to make a run for Bouchon. The food is absolutely amazing and wont break the bank like Per Se or French Laundry. That said, its still not cheap. Expect to pay roughly 30-50 per entree, but its WELL worth it. The atmosphere is very bistro so dont expect it to feel like fine dining in any way. However, the food is amazing.'

S'OK, I\'m spoiled - I live within a 10 minute drive from the original Bouchon. So no, this is not as good as that one! \n\nI had brunch, by myself, at the bar. Had a nice cappuccino, followed by a glass of champagne. I had a sausage dish. When it came out, it was raw in the middle. They swiftly took it away and brought out a fresh "well cooked" dish. It was just "ok". I didn\'t finish it, and left with a meh feeling. I would go back to have dinner or lunch, though. \n\nStaff was efficient and friendly. Courtyard outside is nice for relaxing and enjoying your coffee and a pastry. People in Vegas tend to forget what the outside is like, unless they are poolside. So, the courtyard is a real treat.'

S"Julia Childs would be proud of Thomas Keller's (of French Laundry [Napa] Fame) Bouchon. Bouchon has long been known as one of the top places for a fine high-end lunch in Las Vegas. It's Ironic how the Venetian Hotel tries to mimic the Italian and streets of Venice style, but yet they host a top-of-the-line French restaurant. Whatever sells right? The Palazzo seemingly has 10 Fine Italian restaurants to make up for it.\n\nThe staff was extremely friendly as they seated us, though the wait times were long (French style cuisine always seems to be relaxed and not rushed). \n\nWhile waiting, we read many Yelp reviews and photos to help us make a decision. We were going to get the famous spiced beignets (I love French and Creole beignets), but the chef reminded us the special of the day was a rasberry beignet, so we decided to try it out. It came with two warm, sugar coated beignets (different than Louisiana's creole powdered ones) oozing with rasberry sauce. The sauce was great and had fresh fruit, and it was very good, but it was basically a high-end krispy kreme donut. I'm not sure it was a beignet at all. Though I enjoyed it.\n\nI ordered the croque madame after passing on the sourhdough waffles and french toast (which both had great reviews - next time!), and it was 3 star worthy. $19 for a French sandwhich which had a poached/fried (half/half it seemed) egg on top with hamm and a sweet French sauce. I enjoyed it, though it came with way too many fries (unlimited said the waiter) and I wish instead of all that fries, maybe a small waffle or something else instead would make it better. The bread was half fried, half soft - so it had a great texture to it. Wasn't worth the money and wasn't amazing, but definitely good.\n\nMy friend ordered the famous Bouchon Chicken and Waffles. If you like Roscoe's or Grand Luxe's Chicken & Waffles, you'll enjoy Bouchon's. If you don't care for chicken & waffles, skip this - it's just an improved version of it. The chicken is French rotisserie style (not fried) and is extremely juicy and you can tell it's been marinated for a while. I loved the chicken. The waffle is fluffy and comes with two sauces - a regular maple syrup and a famous salty bacon broth which ad a salsa-like consistency with whole premium bacon strips. I loved the bacon salsa with the waffle. A mixture of salty and sweet.\n\nTotal damage. $60 for a lunch. If you enjoy French food and want a non-buffet fine meal option, check out Bouchon."

S"I've heard a lot of good things about Bouchon's brunch, but I must say I was a little let down while I was there the last time I was in Vegas. Although the restaurant is difficult to find, it is a rather lovely setting whether you're sitting inside or outside. This time in particular I sat outside and throughout the entire brunch we probably only saw our server 3 times.\n\nWe were seated and it took about 15 minutes for anybody to even approach us. We saw a male server hitting up all the tables around us except for ours. Finally a woman approaches our table and takes our orders. I asked for a coffee that took a while to get to the table. I decided on getting the corned beef hash with two eggs, which was recommended by our server and although the food came out in a timely manner, I didn't find anything particularly special about this dish. It was even a little bland and I wanted to ask for hot sauce but our server was out of sight for most of our brunch. When I was finally full and we were all ready to go, our server came back to check on us to see if we needed anything else. \n\nI'm sure there is a reason why people love this place, but I didn't see it the first time I was there. Food and service just wasn't up to par the day I was there."

S"While we were in Vegas, our friends recommended coming to Bouchon. It was actually already on my list, so we agreed to meet up with them at 12:30 on Sunday for Brunch. They said they'd get there early to get in line for a table as they don't take Brunch reservations. At 11:40 we get a phone call as they already got a table, so we rushed to get there as soon as possible. Luckily, even though we got there at 12:30, they weren't rushing our friends out the door, so bonus points for that.\n\nI had the chicken and waffles. I've never really eaten chicken and waffles. So far I've only had posh versions, and the one at Bouchon did not disappoint. The chicken was nicely cooked with delicious gravy. The vanilla butter was great and the syrup on top was nice. Everything went so well together, and I just ate the whole thing. The other half ordered the croque madame and it was delicious. Unfortunately he wasn't feeling the best due to a bit of overindulgence the day before, so he didn't enjoy it as much as he probably would have liked.\n\nI also had a Bloody Mary and a hibiscus bubbly drink. Both of which were really great. The coffee was delicious too. So no complaints on anything really. Great service and great food, and everything I could expect from a Bouchon restaurant."

S"I'm definitely a fan of Bouchon.  I've been to both this location and the BevHills location, and although I would say I favor the BevHills location this one still does a good job.  I still haven't made it to the one in Yountville yet!  Anyway, I have had both bunch and dinner here, and I have to say they do a great job of fancified French bistro food.  Personally I think dinner here is a better value. \n\nFor food, I recommend the steak frites - their fries are delicious (and the steak isn't so bad, either).  This time I for some reason got the vegetable gnocchi, and they were a nice departure - I wasn't looking for something super heavy and it delivered, with lots of fresh veggies and pan seared fluffy gnocchi.  Since it's Vegas, I also got the opportunity to get my foie on.. I got the terrine of foie gras - which I unfortunately was not able to finish (but they packed it up for me for later!).  One of my friends got the pan-seared foie gras which I thought was a better choice flavor-wise.  Anyway, no real complaints for me.\n\nService was good - my water glass was never empty and the waitstaff was efficient enough.  Decor is upscale-bistro style, classy but nothing special.  There is a nice hustle and bustle inside the restaurant but you can still talk to your friends, which is nice.\n\nBouchon, it's always a pleasure."

Awesome.\n\nThe ambiance of this place is awesome. Very French, and glamorous. \n\nI had Champagne, and it was wonderful. Not too sweet, dry, delicious. My boyfriend had beer and he loved his too.\n\nWe started off with the Oysters. OH MY GOD. They were so good....that we ordered another round! I've never had oysters like this before. I want to go back and just order oysters.\n\nLuckily for us, the main courses were just as wonderful. My boyfriend ordered the Steak Frites, and I ordered the Saffron Mussels and Frites. Our server let us know that we would be getting a lot of fries, so she substituted mushrooms for one of the fries. The steak was amazing, cooked perfectly. They were perfect and full of flavor. The mussels were just incredible. The saffron really came through, and they just tasted heavenly. And the frites were the best we'd ever had. \n\nFor dessert, they brought out chocolate mousse cake with orange sauce and a pistacio brittle. It was delightful.\n\nOur server was wonderful and so kind. She did an awesome job.\n\nNext time we are in Vegas, we will be back!!!!"

We started with oysters on the half shell which were excellently shucked and wonderfully fresh. Moved to two salads, one with blue cheese and walnuts, the other with warm goat cheese over dressed greens which were both executed well and were complimented with fresh chewy delicious bread. \n\nFor entrees, my husband had the lamb and I had the chicken. We also opted for sides of mushrooms and mac and cheese. Everything was excellent however the mushrooms were over salted. Considering this wasn't a theme in the meal, I won't hold it against them. \n\nAll of this was accompanied with a nice and inexpensive bottle of white wine which was served and presented as if it was a $300 bottle. That kind of service is always an indicator of a well run restaurant and an attentive staff. Overall cost of the meal was expensive but very, very fairly priced for when we got. \n\nAfter visiting a wide array of places in Vegas, I would recommend this place as a must!"

S'Another breakfast...\n\nMy hubby and I frequent Bouchon as one of our favorite strip restaurants for dinner. The foie terrine and hot epi bread always has us coming back for more. However on a recent brunch the service was less than stellar. \n\nThings were off to a good start as we were sat at "our table" which they also call the Anthony Bourdain table. A crescent shaped banquette made of crushed velour is super comfortable and always romantic. You can ask for it by name and they\'ll know which one you\'re talking about. \n\nWe were sat promptly but once seated we were left hanging for a very long time before our server finally appeared. When she did stop by she seemed less than impressed by us\n\nI ordered the Apple Croissant and the Gravlax for me brekie. Apple croissant, wholly hell man, this is fuck-yeah pastry. Imagine this super light flakey buttery heart stopping layers of sheer awesomeness topped with caramelized apples and strudel. Now imagine that this is no imagination, its real, its good and I ate this delicacy ever so slowly as to not miss a single flavor moment. Honestly this alone is worth 5 stars however its the combined experience that makes up these stars. \n\nGravalax. First off I need to say that I don\'t eat salmon very often unless it\'s coming from a trusted source and yes Thomas Keller is definitely a trusted source. For me this his is like Swedish sushi, beautifully fatty cured raw salmon with accompaniments of capers, tomatoes, onions and chive cream cheese. No bagel here, you get a warm crispy baguette instead. Im not bitching about this as I love anything baked from Bouchon and was a really nice way to stack and eat this dish. I felt very euro. \n\nBack to the service.. our water glasses went empty, nobody checked on us after our food was delivered (my dining companion had an issue so we waved down a busboy so he could find our server), it was like we were abandoned. I don\'t like that the food was better than the service since to me both should have equal standing. \n\nWhile I would go back for dinner Im not sure if its worth going for breakfast/brunch especially since all the pastries can be purchased at one of the Bouchon Bakeries inside the Venetian. I still think about the croissant.'

S"I felt like I was on a treasure hunt getting to this restaurant. If only I can be the aZn kid, Data from the Goonies then it would be awesome. Don't mistaken this spot for the Bouchon Bakery located on the casino floor, that's just the decoy. You must first start off in the lobby where you follow the signs near the check in/out counter. Find the elevator that takes you to a secret Da Vinci floor. Bank a left out of the elevators and continue through the Michelangelo (inspired ceiling) hallways until you hit the spot on your right hand side. \n\nWe arrived here around 1030ish am for brunch on a Saturday. The wait was about 20 minutes. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations. The restaurant was crowded and the tables are right next to each other so don't expect much privacy from your neighbors. I do recall the dude next to us throwing a fit about something.\n\nLet's talk about their table bread. They just throw that bad boy on your table without a basket or a serving plate. Interesting concept but don't worry germaphobes, they use wax tissue paper to handle the bread. The butter and jam is what makes this a winner. First, I believe they're both made freshly. Second, the bread+butter+jam equals a scrumptious treat. Heed my warning: if you're on a carb diet, it's probably not a good idea to try it because you won't want to put it down. The flavor of the day was blackberry I believe. Sooooo bombskiz.\n\nIn honor of Le Roscoe Pierre Chicken & Waffles that I do love to eat in LA, I ordered the: the brunch chicken and waffles. From looking at the price ($25), you'd think they were giving you duck confit and waffles. Although it's a little pricey, I have no buyer's remorse. Honestly, I'm craving it as I type this now. The bacon and chive waffle leaves a distinct taste in your mouth. Normally, you're only use to the taste of butter and syrup. Not these waffles. You get a hint of the saltiness and some other unique flavors with every bite. You even actually feel the crunch of the bacon bits in the waffles itself.\n\nThe chicken is served in 2 pieces. Looks will deceive you here, the portion of the chicken may seem petite but when you actually rip the flesh off the bones like a carnivore that you are, you'll realize that there's plenty of meat to work with. Although the chicken was slightly salty, it was still very tender and juicy. It's accompanied by a mushroom type chauffer gravy sauce.\n\nService was great and the atmosphere is loud & vibrant. I would definitely come back to try other items on the menu and to eat some more bread with homemade jam! It's definitely not a cheap meal but how often are you in Vegas anyways? Also, try their desserts or the bakery items if you have room for it."

S"I opted to have breakfast at Bouchon before the last day of a Vegas conference I was attending.  I had heard great things about the bistro and bakery, and I hoped it wouldn't let me down. When I arrived at about 9 AM, the place was bustling. I took a seat at the bar and waited about 10 minutes for someone to greet me with a menu. I knew immediately what I wanted to order--French toast, a side of sausage, and coffee--and my food was rung in at 9:15. As I caffeinated myself, the minutes ticked away and everyone around me received his or her food. At 9:50 AM, I still had nothing to eat, and I asked the server to check on my food and put it in to-go containers (I had to be at work at 10 AM). Finally, just a few moments before ten, my breakfast appeared from the kitchen and I bolted to my conference. I didn't take my hunger-stoked anger out on the waitress--after all, it wasn't her fault, and she kept my coffee full. However, I will be hesitant to return to Bouchon without much more time to spare. That said, the French toast was divine; the brioche was layered with apples and custard, and it had just the right amount of sweetness. The sausage was spicy, house-made, and absolutely out of this world. If the food was that good on the run, I'd absolutely like to taste it while relaxing in the charming atmosphere of the bistro itself."

S'My favorite Las Vegas restaurant.  Why you ask?  No pretense, relaxed yet sophisticated atmosphere, amazing menu, great wine list, and you can walk out not spending an arm and a leg.\n\nThe meal I enjoyed consisted of:\n- Daily Special App - Crab Rillette: A chunkier rillette than I am used to, but great flavor, paired with toast points.\n- French Onion Soup: Very good, traditional version topped with french bread and gruyere cheese.  A bit on the salty side.\n- Steak Frites : Perfectly cooked steak, topped with a flavorful ma\xc3\xaetre d\'h\xc3\xb4tel butter and carmelized shallots, served alongside some of the best, crispiest french fries.\n- Forest Mushrooms (side dish for table): Mix of various "forest" mushrooms sauteed in butter/garlic.\n- Dessert Special - Chocolate Bouchons: Small servings of moist, dense, chocolate cake shaped like wine cask corks, with chocolate or caramel sauce, paired with ice cream.\n\nOh, and their bread and butter is awesome.\n\nOur server was great too, very funny - cracking jokes with us.'

S"Made a special trip to Vegas for food, and this was one of our stops.  I love the restaurant, it's a shame it's such a nightmare to get to, but that's the Venetian's fault.\n\nI had the Steak Frites and it was amazing.  Enormous pile of some of the best fries I've ever had and a wonderful steak covered in herb butter.  My friend ordered some beef special that was underwhelming to say the least.  The polenta that it came with was so oversalted that it nearly ruined the rest of my meal.  I thought it was a single time mistake, but reading other reviews, I see that someone in the back thinks it's hilarious to oversalt everything.\n\nWe came back for breakfast and my Croque Madame (with another huge pile of fries) was served cold with a completely flavorless sauce.  My friend got the white sausage and eggs.  The sausage was fine, the eggs were standard diner rubbery eggs.  The pineapple jam for breakfast is pretty memorable.\n\nI'd go back for the Steak Frites but I'm afraid to venture too far from that because everything else was pretty bad."

S"I had dinner here on 7/6/12, I was really looking forward to my culinary experience at this restaurant, but, left rather disappointed.   After all there are a number of wonderful restaurants to chose from so was a bit tough deciding on one.  (limited time)\n\nService - Top notch all around.  Bartender, waiter, bussers all excellent.\n\nAppetizer -The beef marrow was superb. Done just right!  My partners, Crispy Duck Confit (a special), was neither crispy nor a confit (nor very special).  It was what seemed to be a boiled duck leg atop of saut\xc3\xa9ed vegi's.  Not spectacular, interesting or tasty at all.\nMain Course - My Veal Chateaubriand was rather bland.  I loved the crispy polenta and the figs.  Expensive polenta and fig dish.  My partners Beef Short Ribs (another special)was extremely good.  Very hearty, full of flavor and satisfying!  So two hits and two rather large misses.  For this type of restaurant thats a big miss!"

S"Sad to say, but this place has gone way downhill from the first time I tried it 5 years ago. Granted, I went to brunch 5 years ago and this time I had dinner, but you can tell by the quality that it's just not the same.  I had the saffron mussels in a white wine broth but I also tried the pate, the steak, and the halibut.  \n\nMussels: There were like 50 mussels on my plate.  Usually I don't mind big portions but the flavor of the broth suffered because th mussel taste overpowered the delicate broth.  The mussels were also fishy so I don't know about how fresh they were.  Also there were some that didn't open all the way and some that were dried out and way over-cooked.\n\nSteak:   Perfectly cooked but had a weird gamey flavor to it. \n\nPate- DELISH\n\nHalibut- okay but forgettable\n\nService:  F-.... took away our plates while we were still eating from it.  Took away our dessert when there was still HALF left.  assholes\n\nI LOVE TK and his bakery inside the venetian is still excellent (esp. those pistachio macarons) but this is a perfect example of a good restaurant with bad management.  I've been to the Bouchons in Napa and in NYC and those are still very good.  It's just THIS one that's really not worth the money"

The side of mac and cheese was creamy, flavorful, and rich. The real star for me was the special. It was a cold potato leek soup. The texture was smooth and buttery. On top it had crumbled bacon and blue cheese. It sounded interesting and all the components worked together so well. \n\nMy boyfriend had the flat iron steak. It was like butter. It was cooked perfectly and the pomme frites were hot, well seasoned and perfectly cooked. He said his salad was well dressed and tasty. I loved the warm pistachios that are served when you first sit down. \n\nOur server was nice, but seemed a bit slow. The back waiters however, were not. They were quick to remove plates and replenish our bread, pistachios, and water.  \n\nThey sent out a complementary lemon cheesecake for my birthday! What a nice touch! We didn't finish it, we were so full!\n\nTo me, this was an epic meal. I really was so happy we chose this restaurant to celebrate my birthday!"

S"While in last Vegas I had 3 different dinners at 3 different locations. This was probably the worst of the 3. The food is very average which is very surprising knowing the chef behind the restaurant. It is a copy of a French brasserie but I would have expected better food.  We had the special soup (yam) which was delicious but that was the only dish that was above average. We also had soup a l'ognion, mussels, gnocchi and the special veal. The waiter did a good job at selling the specials and we expected a better quality food ( we had dinner at Scarpetta the night, now that was outstanding). The place is overpriced, the wine list although extensive is way overpriced and the service is awful. The waiters kept on dropping plates and silvers on the floor, it happened at least 4 times during our dinner, and the busboy poured water into our wine glass. The sommelier was unshaved and in a suit with no tie. It was not a good experience and will not recommend it."

S'Bouchon is one of those places that you go to in Vegas so you can show people back at home pictures of to brag about living a fancy lifestyle in Vegas just because you were in Vegas. It is beautiful inside and directly outside of it. They\'re connected to the outside gardens in the Venetian with beautiful flowers and a pool, along with a really pretty gazebo. Just down the hallway a bit is a lounge near their second "front desk" that has amazing architecture and design that makes you really feel like you\'re not in America anymore, but is instead in Europe. They may be a bit pricey, but you\'re still getting great food and amazing service, so definitely worth the price tag if you\'re up for paying about $20+ for a brunch.\n\nI\'ve had two items on their menu before and they are both delicious. One is the baguette with smoked salmon and capers. This is my pretty standard choice when I\'m not sure what else to get. It is flavorful and the just a good combination always. But if you want something more out of the ordinary, you should definitely look at their Chicken and Waffles. I have never had a waffle that was so meant for chicken! It is not your typical buttermilk waffles. It is the best combination of a savory waffle and chicken where the batter of the waffle has been mixed with bacon and chives! Doesn\'t that just make your mouth water?!? It was so perfect! So crispy on the outside and perfectly fluffy on the inside. The chicken went deliciously well with the whole combination and they roasted it to a good taste, yet didn\'t burn any parts of it. The sauce that comes with the chicken was a bit salty so it went well if you were to order some fries to dip into it too. So a definitely recommendation from me are these two items.\n\nThey also serve you some bread that are shaped in the most unique possible way. It looks like a bunch of leaves strung together and you basically break off one of the leaves. It is a bit hard since it seems a bit over crispy, so don\'t expect too much from that. But other than that, the bread is still good and I think is very artistically appealing for the eyes rather than the teeth that you\'re going to have to use to crunch through the tough to break shell!\n\nIn short, beautiful location, beautiful presentations, amazingly delicious food and wonderful atmosphere. If you need to brag to people about the high life in Vegas, you need to visit this place at least once.'

S'Bouchon was the absolute perfect place for a classy Saturday brunch before getting down and dirty at the Lavo day club later on in the day.\n\nThey do not take ressies for brunch, but was told that if you arrive pre 11am, or post 1pm, you should not have an issue getting a table; just be seated before kitchen closes at 2pm and you are golden. Given my love for brunches waaaaay late in the day, obvi my group of 7 and I arrived a little after 1pm and only waited 5 mins for our table to be ready. \n\nThe atmosphere is light and airy - reminding me a bit of Balthazaar in the city. The menu was extensive & everything sounded amazing, but I knew I HAD to get the chicken & waffles [$25] as well as the croque madame [$19]. A few of us started with some coffee which was rich and aromatic. \n\nThey began by placing 2 "branches" of olive bread on our table. They legit looked like branches! Super cute - we all just grabbed a "leaf" and pulled. It was like having a wishbone moment at Thanksgiving, except we were all winners! ;)\n\nThe plates arrived soon after, and the portions were very very very generous. My friend and I split the C&W and CM and could not finish our meal at all. The CM comes with like 5lbs of french fries! I was pleased to read that the C&W was not fried but roasted, as I had given up fried food for Lent. The chicken on that dish was SOOO succulent, moist, and tasty. It came with gravy, but was juicy enough to eat on its\' own. Each dish comes with a dark meat and a white meat piece - both of which were amazeballs. The waffles are infused with BACON(!!) and chives, and had the right amount of crisp in them. The CM was good, but nothing amazing. I did enjoy the slippery egg on top and the perfectly runny yolk.\n\nThe other girls ordered the Salmon Baguette [$16] (which you have to assemble yourself - cute, but I like my food done for me, thx), pot of mussels [$25.50] (lots and lots of lots and mussels!), and the sourdough waffles [$12] (the girl who ordered this is a waffles fiend, so she def liked it =D)\n\nSuch a great meal w/ my best girlfriends. Would definitely return if I\'m ever back in Vegas (psh, if? More like when...)'

S"Ate here 2/13/08. Made reservation at 8:30pm, arrived at 8:35pm and was seated right away. Was busy for a Wednesday night. Elevators to the restaurant was right next to the elevators from the Venetian parking lot so location was convenient. \n\nWe started with the pate for appetizer. Nice big slab of the pate with some radishes, pickles, some green and 3 slices of toast and mustard. I don't think they gave enough toast to go with the amount of pate given, so we used the rest with the complementary bread. Very yummy! \n\nFor entree I ordered the slow cooked short ribs and my partner ordered the pan roasted trout and fries.\n\nThe short ribs I heard was slow roasted for 12 hrs! It was incredibly HUGE! It must've weighed a pound at least! It came with creamy polenta as well. It was delicious! Big thick piece of meat, had to take the rest as left overs.\n\nThe trout was equally delicious. Not a piece of bone in the fish. It was butterflied very well. Excellent crunch to the roasted almonds too. \n\nWe also ordered cocktails. 2 Grand Cru and 1 Soleil. Grand Cru was delicious, that's why we ordered 2! No room for desserts unfortunately.\n\nTotal bill came to $125 for two after taxes and before tips. Not bad for the food and place. It was however loud."

S"Came for dinner with two close friends during our most recent Vegas trip. I've heard good things about Bouchon and Thomas Keller so I was really excited. \n\nThe service was really good but the food fell a bit short of expectations. \n\nService: Our waiter was pretty good. He knew the specials of the day and was able to suggest wines that complemented our entrees. He was really sneaky about figuring out who's birthday it was without asking us upfront (did it when he carded us for our drinks). Funny thing, the birthday girl ended up not coming to dinner so he just assumed it was the guy who didn't get a drink that night. LOL...props to him and his detective skills though!\n\nFood: \nDuck Confit -- the duck was delicious. Outside was nice and crisp while the inside was very nice and tender. The accompanying lentils and vegetables were delicious too, but they didn't complement the duck very well.\n\nVeal -- very tender. I can't remember what else was on the plate (left the menu in the hotel room...foodie fail) but the presentation was really nice. \n\nRoasted leg of lamb -- much lighter than expected. The components worked well together but I was hoping for a richer sauce and bolder flavors. Polenta wasn't too heavily seasoned which actually worked out well with the dish (surprisingly since I love super rich polenta haha).\n\nSole -- one of the richer dishes of the night. Comes with some clams and chickpeas.\n\nFrench fries -- were pretty delicious. Our server recommended them since they're supposedly known for their fries (fried in peanut oil). I was really disappointed that they just serve them with regular ketchup though...for the price I was expecting house-made ketchup or a more unique dipping condiment.\n\nPot de Creme (strawberry flavored) -- good end to the meal. We all wanted something light and fruity. It's a good size for two if you don't have enough room for a full dessert.\n\nBirthday dessert (chocolate cake, mint/ginger ice cream) -- super delicious. The ice cream was a nice surprise (wasn't expecting that flavor profile) and the chocolate cake was really rich and decadent.\n\nOverall, A-OK experience. I'm actually more curious about their brunch offerings now after reading other reviews and considering how much I like their bakery..."

S'I can\'t say I discovered this place, and with 700 reviews I am not sure there\'s much that I can add.  I was lucky since they stay open later on weekends so we could enjoy "brunch" here instead of an early breakfast.  I had read about Bouchon in the travel pages of the New York Times, and decided to eat here the next time I was in Las Vegas.  I was not disappointed.  The service was fast and efficient, my champagne cocktail tasted fantastic (nothing like those sour Mimosas I\'ve had before), and the French Toast (bread pudding style) was  unbelievably good. My friend enjoyed his eggs with white sausage. Best of all, when the check came, Bouchon was nowhere as expensive as I had imagined (okay it wasn\'t cheap either but a much better value than a lot of other restaurants in Las Vegas).  Perhaps because it is hidden away (almost literally) upstairs and down some hallways at the Venetian.  Now that I\'ve found it, I plan on going back again the next time I am in Las Vegas.'

S'Really bad food. We ordered their "special"  of the day which was the lobster hash and a quiche. The lobster really chewy and smelled really fishy. They wouldn\'t accommodate a fried egg on top of the hash instead of scrambled either. The quiche was cold in the center and seemed like it was reheated in the microwave. We asked to get something different instead and ordered a cobb salad and blueberry muffin which we hoped would be safer choices, but alas, they were not. The salad was really small for a $17 dollar salad and really gross chunks of bacon fat in it. The blueberry muffin appeared as if it had been microwaved as well and was dried out. Lunch was practically inedible and with all of our complaints a manager never so much as looked out way. We were extremely dissapointed!\n\nOh also water is $7 and they won\'t tell you there is a charge until you get the bill!'

S"A cute brunch spot in the Venetian. It's a little confusing to get to. You have to take the guest elevator up to the guest lobby. We went on a Saturday morning around 11, and waited for about 10 minutes. I loved that they can just text you when your table is ready.  Insider tip: there's a pool with lawn chairs around the corner--great place to relax until your table is ready!\n\nWe ordered the chicken and waffles, croque madame, and a side of bacon. The bacon was super crispy and yummy! I was a little underwhelmed with our two entrees though--they were good, but nothing special in my honest opinion. Especially given how expensive they were and the the hype, I was definitely expecting something more. I was also surprised that the chicken was more of a rotisserie chicken than fried chicken.\n\nWhy 4 stars? You really can't beat the service there.They accidentally gave our croque madame to another table, so had to remake it for us. To compensate, they offered us cocktails--I opted for a almond chocolate croissant instead. When they brought us our croque madame, they told us that they would also take it off our bill given the mess-up. SWEET! I love free stuff! I thought that was super nice of them, especially given they had already given us a free cocktail and a croissant.\n\nWill I go again next time I'm in vegas?

S"My husband & I love this place. We've had lunch in Yountville, which had the best salmon terrine we've ever tasted. In Vegas, we've been for dinner once (last year), breakfast twice (this visit), and will go again tomorrow before we head out. The french toast, a terrine of bread pudding and custard, is unique & fantastic. As are the sourdough waffles. The service is generally good -- our waitress yesterday was great & especially attentive; our waiter this morning was good. \n\nOne odd little note: while the frites are pretty good, my husband read an article recently (1/09) that Keller buys frozen fries, that making so many of them uniformly would be nearly impossible. This surprised us. Food snobs, even snobbier than us (Anthony Bourdain, for example), revere Keller for his simple, fresh ingredients. We went to Zuni in San Francisco the day after eating at Bouchon in Yountville and thought their handmade shoestrings were 100 times better.\n\nBut we think breakfast at Bouchon at the Venetian is one of the best on the strip. Highly recommended."

While probably the least popular of his culinary trifecta of Bouchon (vegas & yountville), French Laundry, and Per Se, starting off with this restaurant is nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nIf you scroll down to Seth W.'s review, I was also in his party of 12 that drank the absinthe and easily had one of the best dining experiences of my life, with good food, good drink, and excellent company.  \n\nThe first thing that showed me this is a quality restaurant was the excellent, attentive wait staff.  Starting off with a very knowledgeable waiter (who else can explain why castrated chicken is more tasty and juicy?), to a well-versed sommelier who taught us the history of absinthe, we were taken care of through the entirety of our meal.\n\nWe started off with an amuse bouche of salmon spread with salmon cooked a few different ways (smoked, pureed, etc.).  Had I known about this, I probably wouldn't have ordered the salmon tartare appetizer, as this tasted a little bit better.  The consistency was such that you could take a butter knife and spread it across the biscuit.\n\nThe salmon tartare starter had a similar taste, except it was surrounded by bits of hard boiled egg.  I can't say that it did or didn't complement the tartare well, but the amuse bouche was definitely better tasting without any extraneous tastes that the egg brought.\n\nNever fear though, as I'm confident that I got the best main course of the table.  The Epaule de Porc is a braised pork shoulder with glazed root vegetables, celeriac remoulade & pork jus (quoted from the menu).  In everyday speak, this is the most tender pork that exists.  Saying that it melts in your mouth is an understatement.  Think about a warm tasty porky marshmallow that gives you feelings of the first time you made love, but not as short lasting.  That's about as close as I can put into words to describe this amazing dish.\n\nPutting it in perspective, having this kind of amazing meal for under $100 in Vegas (not to mention in the Venetian) is quite a steal."

S"Went here for breakfast with my family.  I couldn't imagine what the fuss was about - after all, how could one really innovate on baked goods or standard American breakfast?  \n\nI was very wrong.  The apple croissant that I had was absolutely amazing and was a great complement to the American breakfast that I ordered.  I am a fan of poached eggs and they were poached just right.  Their coffee was also very good, and everyone at the table agreed that the food was top notch.\n\nWould definitely come again and again!"

S'Really 3.5 stars for me.  This is really a result of extremely high expectations.  I had very high hopes for Bouchon, and while it did meet some of those hopes and expectations, it failed to meet my overall satisfaction.\n\nUnlike other fine dining establishments, this particular locations is a lot noisier than others.  It could be cold stone tile that tends to reverberate noise more, or it could just be the spacious area with vaulted ceilings  that allow sounds to travel farther.  I was expecting a more private/intimate type dinner, but felt that it was interrupted by other guests\' conversations or the clomping of shoes on tile.\n\nThe food however was fairly good.  It wasn\'t French Laundry good nor Gary Danko\'s good, rather it was maybe on a even keel with Alexander\'s.  We had the veal and the trout, which mixed reactions for both.  The Veal was very tasty, extremely tender and a wondrous mix of flavors.  The pickled shitake mushrooms complimented the veal nicely along with a plum risotto.  The trout was very average, just seasoned, bakes, and topped off with peas and butter.  It really wasn\'t anything to write home about.\n\nI\'m really surprised at how many people ooo and ahhh over the steak frites.  Hello?  Am I missing something here?  Isn\'t that just another term for "Steak Fries"?  All they are are seasoned and served on top of a steak of in a huge container.  When it comes down to it, it\'s still a \'french fry\'.  I really didn\'t see how so much excitement and hype could come over a simple piece of fried potato.\n\nOverall the service was good, portion size was OK.  Prices are fairly reasonable for the quality, presentation, and variety of dishes you can choose from.  The Ambiance is nice, and on a nice day, I\'m sure the patio seating is great to dine and relax at.\n\nhowever when it comes to the Bouchon name in Vegas, I\'d go out of my way to go their bakery stand outside the Phantom Theater in the Venetian, but I wouldn\'t go out of my way for dinner at the restaurant.'

S'Don\'t ask me why, but I ordered the chicken and waffles.  Oh, I know why!  Because they were either out of the specials on the menu or everything else has some sort of pork meat in it.  Just great.  Even the waffles had bacon in them (but they had plain waffles as well, which they brought out to me after messing up my order the first time around).  \n\nLet\'s just say that I did NOT like my meal.  the chicken smelled.  You know that smell?  That chicken smell?  Yeah, yeah, yeah I know you\'re saying to yourself "well wtf is chicken supposed to smell like then?" but you know what I mean.  Thankfully they had amazing freshly baked bread and butter which I had with a good cup of cappuccino.\n\nI will say this, the 4 or 5 other people with me seemed to enjoy their meals.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing?  Who knows?  I certainly won\'t unless someone else is willing to pay for my meal there.'

S"What a huge disappointment.  My husband and I stayed at The Venetian and heard good things about Bouchon so we thought we'd give it a try for our one year anniversary dinner.  What a mistake that was!   I ordered the skate and my husband had the steak frites; both were WAY too salty/overseasoned - almost to the point where his steak was not edible.  My skate was bland, albeit too salty, and seenmed soggy in the center but dry on the outside.  I ordered the potato puree side which could have used MORE seasoning as it was very bland.   As I mentioned, my husband's steak was way way too salty and, frankly, the cut of meat was not good.  \n\nWe did order a pork & shiitake mushroom appetizer which was actually very good so I was surprised with the poor quality of our entrees.\n\nOn a positive note, our server was very attentive and  provided great service.\n\nOverall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.  I would not return."

S'Was this a joke?\n\nIf it was, neither of us was laughing.\n\nMy sis and I were in Vegas for a nursing conference.  I love French food, she\'s up for almost anything, Bouchon seemed an obvious choice.\n\nThe interior is fancy-French (in an overdone, Vegas sort of way).  We were seated quickly and attended by an initially cheerful waiter who couldn\'t stop crowing about the heirloom tomato salad.  He was so insistent I had to wonder if the chef had ordered too many.  \n\nWe ordered the spring pea soup, melon salad, octopus salad, and a main of gnocchi (all to share).\n\nThe soup arrived and was beautiful.  A bright spring-green with a flourish of flash-fried black rice skimming the top.  I was SO excited.  Then I tasted it.  WHOA.  The SALT.  I couldn\'t believe it.  My sister grimaced too.  To our dismay, we had to send it back.\n\nThe melon "salad" was an odd little assortment of shaved barely-there melon curls balanced on their ends, tiny slices of fig, mini-marshmallow-sized bits of cheese and daubs of a meyer-lemon cream delight.  This dish was fresh, tasty, and beautiful to look at (though so miniature as to seem like a plate you\'d make up for a doll\'s tea party).  No stranger to tiny bites (nor to the Las Vegas markup) I thought the over-salted soup must have been a fluke.\n\nWRONG.  \n\nHere\'s a run-down of our other dishes:\n\nThe octopus salad: Quite salty on the outside, but since octopus meat is pretty bland, it worked out o.k.  I love salty food when it\'s done right, and this octopus was cooked perfectly.\n\nThe tomato salad: We grudgingly ordered this when our soup had to go back.  Heirloom tomatoes, a little cress, a garnish of fried onion.  The tomatoes, sadly, did not knock our socks off as the waiter had suggested.  They had no more or less flavor than an heirloom bought at Whole Foods.\n\nThe gnocchi: So incredibly over-salted I couldn\'t believe what I was tasting.  Clearly the pasta was hand-made and cooked perfectly, so why was the dish RUINED by too much salt?  And gnocchi is a perfect cushy, carby, salt delivery system!  How in the hell do you over-salt gnocchi?  It was as if the kitchen was bored and dared each other to screw with the poor tourist saps to see if they\'d catch on.\n\nThe skate: (Ordered after the gnocchi disaster.)  Flavorful and also too salty, the skate was overcooked.  By this time we were an hour and a half into our meal, and thought, "fuck it, let\'s just eat this and get the hell out".  Our waiter had abandoned us for a table of 8 vulgar, shiny, tits-up-to-there, nouveau-riche cougars who were already sauced.  Cutting his losses.  I can\'t say I blame him.  The gang of Real Housewives types were so lit, I\'m sure they couldn\'t taste anything, and as the waiter was cute and young and full of flattery, no doubt he got a good tip.\n\nIn total, with only one glass of wine a-piece, and even after all the dishes we had to send back, the bill was well over $100.  We got no real apology from anyone about the over-salted food (by the 3rd dish we sent back it was clear the staff was annoyed).  If we hadn\'t had to get out the door to a show I would have caused a scene.  As it was, we paid the bill and fled.\n\nI still can\'t get over how clearly well-prepared the food was and what a shame and a waste it was that it was ruined by something as simple as too much salt.  Is the Chef-de-Cuisine a chain smoker with nary a taste-bud left to his name?  Was the Chef-de-Partie not paying attention when he made the stock and salted it twice, sending it out to ruin every dish it touched? \n\nWhat a waste.'

S'We have been here before and looked forward to returning.  What a disappointment!  The steaks were tough.  We ordered a seafood tower and the presentation was sloppy.  The shrimp were just thrown on top of the other shellfish.  The frites were not as good as they used to be.  The service was not up to par.  Thomas Keller should be ashamed of how his restaurant has gone down hill.'

S"We had dinner here and it was amazing.  My husband had the chicken dish with corn and natural jus and it was spectacular.  A 20 hour brining and roasting process made the skin really crispy and flavorful - he's particular and couldn't stop talking about this.  My dayboat scallop special with the mushrooms and swiss chard and a special vinaigrette were also exceptional.  The french onion soup was a little disappointing but only because it was made with white wine and we prefer the flavor of dry sherry.  The prices are not cheap but this is owned by a world class chef with preparation to match.  These are not dishes you can make at home, Chef Keller deserves his reputation!  We will be back on our next trip to Vegas"

S'This is one of those places that it really pays to ask the waiter for suggestions rather than agonizing and sort of guessing at what\'s best.   Weekday seating is fairly easy to get a table without much fuss.  You absolutely need to make a reservation on the weekends, or you will likely wait an hour or longer.\n\nThe highlight\'s here are definitely the pastries and the corned beef hash, which is fantastic.  The pastry basket is very reasonably priced for a set of four nice pastries, and they let you choose. ASK THE WAITER, they know which are the freshest/best and will make some nice suggestions, even if you decide there are a couple you don\'t want to miss.  The specials and some of the other items are hit or miss.  Recently, they had a lobster hash which I found to be a little underwhelming with the scrambled egg, I think it might have actually been better as a cheaper crab hash, to be honest.   A few of the other items (I\'ve eaten here 4 times):\n\nQuiche:  This is a rotating flavor of the day/week.  I\'m always in a group of 3-4 and we split one of these,  twice it was Florentine which was underwhelming and fairly boring, tbh. \n\nBourbon French Toast: Just think bread pudding, not french toast, because that is what this is.  This was solidly good but not spectacular.\n\nCorned Beef Hash:  Order this.  It\'s awesome.\n\nPork Loin:  Another highlight, I know you\'re going to read this and think "ham and eggs" basically, but the smokiness of the loin was fantastic with the eggs, and you probably haven\'t had a piece like this.\n\nMussels:  Really good thing to split if you have a group.  \n\nPastries: They usually have a special pastry or two (apple danish last time I was there), the plain croissant is better than the chocolate croissant, but really you can\'t go wrong in general with what you order here.'

S"I came here recently on a trip to Vegas with some friends. We made reservations that day when we checked into our room at The Venetian and were seated promptly when we arrived. The waiters were very friendly and everything was done according to etiquette (e.g. serving the ladies first, serving food only from your left side, etc.).They started us off with bread and butter which was very delicious. They also gave us a free appetizer of marinated olives, which was a very light appetizer so it was perfect before our big meal. I ordered the roasted chicken and it was incredibly tender and the meat fell off the bones. The side of celery and candied apples were also delicious. The size was very good for what we paid. We got a bottle of merlot that went very well with the meal and they served us several times in our glasses so we wouldn't even have to touch the bottle. After dinner we each got a different dessert and shared them all and they were all incredible and compliment each other well. The lemon tart was huge and easily the biggest dessert there. Very tangy so only get it if you like the sourness of lemon. The chocolate dessert was incredibly rich as was the meringue over cream. The custard caramel was extremely smooth and the right amount of creamy and sweet. I would definitely going there if you're looking for a nice dinner."

S"Another success for Thomas Keller.  Located on the quieter back side of the Venetian, this large French restaurant is great for lunch or dinner, but the best for Sunday brunch.  It gets busy quick so either come early or be prepared to wait. \n\nThere is fresh seafood that greets you behind the host's platform.  I suggest a dozen oysters and a spicy bloody mary to get things started.  Almost everything on the menu is delicious, and they always have a few specials including an omlette/egg dish.  If you have room at the end, have some french press coffee and the beignets.  This is my recipe for happiness.  Oh yeah, finish by waddling back to your room, having some afternoon nookie (optional), and then taking a fat ass nap.  Life is good."

S'Mmmm--\nThis is the best meal I had while in Vegas.  We tried the pork with apricots, the roasted chicken, and the special soup of the day--creamed spinach.  Everything was great, and in good portions for Vegas (no micro-food here).  The presentation was beautiful, the service is good, and the atmosphere is pleasant and casual.  I like that it is also in the Venezia tower--away from the main drag inside the Venetian (i.e. less foot traffic and noise).  I would definitely come back.  I would add that serving bread hot would have been a nice touch, given the price.'

S"Dining at Bouchon is always a special treat! I have yet to have the pleasure of coming here for dinner, but I'm a big fan of their weekend brunch. I've celebrated my birthday here and took the day off from work to do so - which was totally worth it. They do not take reservations for brunch, so you have to come and give your name, but I've never waited too long. Even during my bachelorette party weekend, where they said the table for 8+ was 45 minutes, we got seated in 10 minutes. If there is a wait, they have a cute little seating area and usually pastries for you to sample. They have some daily specials, like a quiche of the day or soup of the day. Their quiches are perfectly soft and pillowy on the inside. I'm actually not a huge fan of their chicken & bacon chive waffles, but since everyone else raves about them, don't let my opinion stop you. One of my must orders is a side of fries - though I do wish they gave slightly bigger portions of ketchup and mayo, I always feel like such a classless fool when I have to ask for more. If you're with a larger group of people, the pastry basket is always a nice way to start off brunch as well while your entrees come in. I was so hungover and sick during the morning of my bachelorette weekend, I couldn't enjoy eating here. I sustained myself on ginger ale and their tasty cauliflower soup, while i watched everyone enjoy their mussels and steaks. I did have some of the foie gras that was ordered for the table - amazingly silky, and a big hit with all the Californians. I was so jealous of everyone's enjoyment, my husband and I ate here the next weekend so I could enjoy Bouchon like how it's meant to be enjoyed. I actually prefer sitting inside since it's beautifully decorated. The outside patio is right next to the pool and some bodies are just not meant to be looked at while you eat brunch. Their champagne cocktails are all really interesting, so you don't have to be basic and get a mimosa, there are a ton of other options. One of my favorite things to eat here is actually complimentary - I love eating their warm baguettes with the mustard on the table while my husband prefers spreading jam and butter on it. \n\nI will  definitely be back here several more times and hopefully get to enjoy their dinner menu soon."

S'I\'ve had desserts from Bouchon, but this was my first time dining here. I had a lovely Bellini with ripe raspberry while waiting for our table and we all enjoyed the pastry samples that were put out in the bar area. Needless to say, they were delicious!\n\nI ordered the cinnamon apple oatmeal and brioche with jam which was outstanding and my boyfriend ordered sourdough waffles with bananas and walnuts. He loved them! Other dishes at the table included "bread pudding" french toast, yogurt parfait, and pastries; everyone was very happy with their meals.\n\nAll in all, we really enjoyed our brunch.'

S"Out of the way of the masses on the tenth floor of the Venetian Casino/Hotel is one of the best restaurants in Vegas.\n\nWe went on a Saturday afternoon when no reservations are taken. Our wait was about 45 minutes but well worth it.\n\nI ordered the Croque Madame and my husband ordered the chicken and waffles.\n\nThe Croque Madame is a toasted ham and cheese brioche with a fried egg and mornay sauce served with french fries. The meal was prepared perfectly with the egg bursting forth when I cut into the brioche.\n\nThe chicken and waffles were excellent, and it is considered one of Chef Keller's signature dishes. The chicken was cooked perfectly with crispy skin, tender meat and very moist. The experience of biting into chicken, waffle and Tahitian vanilla bean butter sauce was exquisite. It also comes with fries that go very well with the overall presentation.\n\nMake sure you come on the weekend for Brunch - it is the only time that they serve the chicken and waffles.\n\nI just wish we had more room to order more food!"

S"I took my friend here for an early birthday dinner during restaurant week, \nthe restaurant was not packed at all and they still had plenty of seating available at a 5pm on a Friday night. \n\nI made reservations but it wasn't necessary since they had so much spaces, we ended up getting outdoor seating which is a must !! if you are coming here because the view outside is gorgeous and helps you get away from the craziness and fanaticism of Vegas.  There are fountains outside with lots of foliage, and tons of lounging area as well. \n\nWe decided to forgo the restaurant week menu since it didn't seem to have anything special nor worth getting compared to the regular menu. \n\nWe ended up ordering the escargots a la bourguignonne, croque madame with truffle fries!! MUST GET TRUFFLE FRIES, its worth the surcharge of $11. \nMy friend ordered the pan seared trout with sliced almonds and green beans, which was delicious and oh so tender. \n\nYou have to save the butter garlic sauce to dip the bread in after eating the escargots, I would purchase this sauce if they sold it because that's how good it is.  The croque madame is the best croque madame I have ever had, however I haven't had a croque madame since French class in 5th grade, but this croque madame was pretty freaking good.  The runny egg has got to be the best part. \nI wasn't able to finish the fries or even half of my sandwich, so I took it home and my brother ended up eating it . sad day. \n\nWill come back to try their brunch!!"

Didn't want to ask about it, I was just damn hungry! So scaled the menu and couldn't figure out if I wanted breakfast or lunch because both sound great!\n\n Our waitress was nice unlike those losers that tried talking shit on me.  We started off with some champagne cocktails. I think I ordered Strawberry fields and it was deeeeeeeeeelish! I loved that drink and I could drink more but I really don't like drinking when the suns still up!  Onto the food we ordered. I ordered this dish with some bomb toast, potato sphere lookin thing lol eggs and sausage. PIC ordered the french toast and the side of bacon.  Everything looked like basic breakie BUT it was tassssty and fresh. The side of bacon was a BIG side of bacon. Im telling you like 8 pieces of thick cut bacon. I love putting sugar on my bacon and that hit the spot! I had no complaints from this breakfast. Straight to the point brekie, not fancy schmancy. PIC didn't say much about his dish since hes no foodie like me!\n\nI will comeback here but if I see those two shit talking waiters, Im dropping a drink on both of their bobbleheads!"

S"Loved the Bakery.. Finally decided to try the Daddy shop - Bouchon (The Restaurant):\n\n10th Floor, Venezia Tower.. Walked in here for Brunch. The place had a Classy Decor, Very Professional Staff and Clientele were mostly Upper Class looking individuals. \n\nStarters:\n\nBread with butter, jam and ketchup?!: Bread was shaped like a branch with leaves.. something like that. It was hard but the inside was soft and tasted fresh. The butter was kinda hard too, the jam was pretty good and the ketchup I guess was for the fries to come? Who eats bread with ketchup?\n\nCheese Danish - Looked like a croissant shaped like a muffin, with a dab of some cream cheese butter on top. This was So Flaky/Soft and the cream cheese butter lightly spread throughout was perfectly balanced.. This wasn't your ordinary cheese danish (pre-packaged grocery store bought), this thing was Superb!\n\nCroque Madame: Toasted ham & cheese on brioche with a fried egg & mornay sauce. Served with pommes frites.. Sounded quite fancy for a breakfast dish - In Layman's Terms = Ham & Cheese Sandwich with Egg and Fries! Toast tasted like a really buttered croissant with an airy texture. Ham & Cheese wasn't the oscar mayer ham nor Kraft cheese I use for h&c sandwiches back at home, it was much more gourmealicous! Plus, with the fried egg, more like a sunny side up egg and their white creamy/frothy sauce, makes an Incredible Sandwich! Fries were served as a generous amount and were plain good. \n\nCorned Beef Hash with eggs and toast: Corned Beef hash came in shallow bowl with a blanket of overeasy eggs practically covering the hash. I scooted over the eggs to try just the flavor of the corned beef. They were little cubed chunks sitting on top of some pretty tasty juice/sauce. The cubes tasted and had the texture of ham. The juice/sauce gave it a great beef flavor but not the usual Real and typical corned beef I'm used to having. Nevertheless, it was Good. The toast were thick and had a buttery flavor and reminded me of a Crouton. Like a Toast Bread Shaped Crouton?!..\n\nFancy  Place, Great Service, Delectable Food But Came with a price.. $83.00 for 2 including 11.00 Tip.. Oh, it did include 2 Mimosa's! Cheers!!"

S"Hey LV yelpers!\nI love Bouchon!\nI had dinner here while visiting Vegas in 2010 and came back recently now that I live in Vegas and dinner was excellent both visits.\nBouchon is my favorite french fine dining on the strip so far.\nCan't wait to go back.\nI'm a fan of their salmon spread (not sure on the name, I ask just for it) and their lamb :) save room for dessert! I love their chocolate filled mini donuts.\nMake reservations! If you're not drinking alcohol dinner for 2 should be around $125\n-Miss Yelp 2012"

Also love that there's no reservation needed for breakfast, and it's only an elevator hop away from your room. \n\nMy fave is the chicken and waffle!  Can't wait to have it again!"

S"We loved dinner so much here, we came back for the very next meal: breakfast!  Although I liked the dinner far better than the breakfast (predictable, given my vegetarianism and dislike of eggs), I still want to give this five stars.\n\nIt's possible that I was dazzled because I really never eat at restaurants of this quality.  But if you also rarely dine like this, listen in:\n\n-Our server was adorable and fun, while still being respectful and unobtrusive.  Think about it --is there better criteria for a waiter out there?  He was like the perfect background music, and I'd go back for him alone.  I wish I remember his name --a young 30-something Polish guy.  But luckily there are many other reasons to return....\n\n-The cheese course was perfect in its range and selections.  Great accompaniments not only served alongside (honeycomb, the right breads and crackers), but also to the bread and pistachios at the table.\n\n-A wine list that gave just the right info to make good pairing choices.\n\n-I loved my gnocchi, served with winter vegetables in a mild and yet cohesive brown butter sauce.  It was heavy and greasy, and somehow that was a good thing.  A must-try!\n\n-Sides of pommes frites and mac and cheese set the bar for any future fry or mac 'n cheese, who will lose any battles they attempt.\n\n-Salad perfectly herbed and vinegared, worked great with the warm goat cheese.\n\n-The madiera tasting for dessert!!!  I had good madiera in storage before this.  Now nothing compares.  This may be a bad thing in general.  But that night, it was a very, very good thing.  1989 Madiera!!\n\n-I'm not a big breakfast fan, and I don't like meat or eggs.  (Anyone still reading!  haha)  But I can say that the french toast was excellent despite the egginess.  (It's more like a bread pudding, with apples.)  And the cheese danish was the best I've ever had.\n\nI'll not only be back to Bouchon next time I'm in Vegas, but Bouchon in Napa is now on the list for our honeymoon next summer!\n\nAbsolutely worth every single penny (yes, ALL of them).  Go."

S"hands down 5 stars!\n\nit wasn't crowded at all on a sunday night so we were able to push back our reservation pretty easily since we were running late. the restaurant is located in the venetian, its a bit tricky because you  have to use the elevators near the lobby and go up to the top floor. its a pretty hidden restaurant but just ask for directions if you need help finding this place.\n\nwe started off with the mac n cheese which i'm pretty sure is the best mac n cheese i've had. i can't even describe it. but you could tell the cheese and cream they used were both top notch. wasn't heavy either. but sooooo tasty. we scarfed that down in about 2 minutes. \nfor our entrees we ordered the steak frites and the duck.  both were great. my steak was cooked well and the fries were excellent. the duck was served on a bed of risotto? or brown rice...im not sure. but everything tasted so great together. \n\nfor dessert our waitor recommended we get the special of the day which was the potted cherry cheesecake. it was delicious! very cute presentation as well. its not on their regular menu but maybe ask for it if you're into cheesecake..\n\ngreat restaurant choice and i'm so glad we came here instead of doing a prix fixe dinner at the wynn."

S'Good food and good service.\n\nThe Service\nOur server, Paul, was more entertaining than some of the shows in vegas.  Aside from joking around - he directed us towards good items, discouraged my wife from ordering salmon, because he knew thats what she "always orders everywhere else" and joked around taking pictures.  When we tried to order a chocolate souffle for desert, he emphatically said "no" and demanded that we order the off-menu special "bouchons - cork shaped double chocolate brownies with a trio of ice cream".  If his personality had been slightly different -this probably would have *really* rubbed me the wrong way - but given his personality, and the service he\'d provided us with through our meal - his strange behavior just sort of seemed to make sense.  We ordered the Bouchons.\n\nTHE FOOD\n\nUpon being seated - we were served excellent bread with butter and mustard and warm pistachios.  The pistachios were a neat idea and a lot of fun. \n\nBeing the low-end wine drinkers that we are - we ordered a carafe of house wine - and were satisfied with it.  \n\nAs first courses - we ordered the country pate and the duck leg - both were excellent.\n\nWe ordered the fries with our mains.  After watching the episode of "no reservations" in las vegas and seeing Tony Bourdain fall in love with the fries made us feel obligated.  They were probably the most forgettable about the meal.  Just fries...\n\nMy wife had the duck breast - which was excellent and perfectly cooked.  I had the leg of lamb with ratatouille.  The lamb was tasty, but i felt like the portion should have been a lot larger.  \n\nDesert-  we ordered the signature desert - at Paul, our server\'s insistance.\n\nThe brownies weren\'t anything that special - but they were served with a trio of ice cream.  One of the flavors, cinammon - was fantastic - and really made the whole plate worthwhile.'

S"I'll start off by saying that I had an enjoyable dinner at Bouchon, but judging from the reviews on yelp, Bouchon's strong point is probably their brunch.\n\nBetween myself and my two companions, we had: a dozen oysters, a duck breast salad, grilled octopus salad, a summer squash soup, two lamb dishes, the roast chicken, a cardamom pot de creme and a creme brulee.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the dessert, closely followed by the oysters -- the rest of the dishes were good but nothing was surprising.\n\nAlso, the hostess was rude to my friends and I was a little disappointed that their in-restaurant menu was different and less adventurous than what was posted on the website."

This is probably the high class version of las vegas buffet and you dont have to stare at the nasty ordinary food in typical vegas buffets.  Will definetely come here again unless another chic hotels opens up. Oh yea, i knocked a star off because it was all the way in the back of the hotel.

S"I do not usually eat buffet, but I always come to wicked spoon for my Vegas trip. The most important WARNING: this restaurant has its good things and bad things. \n\n  First of all, I never wait for the times I visited since i always around 1-2 pm. I guess people were still having hang overs. The price for lunch was $37, which is the same amount as Caesars palace. \n  The things I like about wicked spoon are:\n1. I loveeeee the interior design , and the vibe in this restaurant. The staff was very active too.\n2. The salad here was really good !!!!! I can't stop eating them \n3. You have so many choices, and they all come with small portions. As a person with a small appetite, they are so prefect for me. I can actually try everything in this restaurant\n   However. The things I do not like: \n1. I love how they have very weird and wicked dishes, but not every one of them is delicious ! Sometimes it even taste bad\n2. As a meat lover, I think their fried chicken need to improve !!!!!!!\n\nOthers than that, I would say I will still come to wicked spoon when I visit Las Vegas:)"

S"We first went to Bellagio's buffet but the line was simply really loongg...and at 6:30, I was getting hungry.  So we went next door to the Cosmopolitan.  \n\nIt was their holiday buffet and dinner cost $47 each + tax, so a little over $100 for 2 people.  We arrived about 6:50 and counting the wait to pay and the wait to sit was another 40 minutes.  We were seated at 7:30 PM.  \n\nHaving eaten at the Monte Carlo buffet the night before where it was less than memorable and food looking a bit worrisome, I have to say I enjoyed the food here!\n\nThe place was clean, the food was presented well.  The ambiance is more relaxed than Bacchanal or Bellagios. I tried the shrimp ball, the bone marrow and the roast pork- I picked up only the crispy skin. Yum.  I did not eat any pasta, that'll fill up the stomach fast.  I tried the risotto and a tablespoon of the sweet potato casserole.  Then I went to the veggies portion, I tried the broccoli with white beans and endive salad.  Next to the seafood-- yes I attacked the crab legs, a plateful of it.  My brother the meat-eater had his fill of the ribs and beef.  \n\nFinally dessert, I picked the chocolate covered strawberries, the mousse and the gelato.  Topped it off with coffee.  We stayed until closing time and left at 9:30 PM.  \n\nThe service once seated was also attentive and pleasant. I think the two seating managers were overwhelmed initially because the line kept getting longer yet only two people had the task of seating them.  A third person came close to 7:20 PM and she went out to the line and wrote down how many seats each customer lined up needed.  \n\nI recommend this place and would dine again if I find myself in Las Vegas.  This is a good find."

S"$54 for brunch buffet and bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's! All 10 girls were GAME ON! \n\nWe arrived on Saturday pretty late into brunch (it IS a bachelorette party, who gets up that early!!) but there was still a good amount of people there. We were seated immediately and ordered our drinks which arrived at the table strikingly fast. \n\nI was overwhelmed by the variety of food and how beautiful each dish was presented! I loved how each dish was portioned for one person to try. I tried the salads, muscles, chicken wings, cheese and bread, mac and cheese, while mushroom spaghetti, and a few other dishes. Every dish was delicious. There was not a dish that I tried that I did not like. The flavors were rich, so super rich.\n\nOur waiter was very nice and got all our drinks on our table in a timely manner. Those girls kept ordering the mimosas and the drinks kept on coming! The buffet area was super clean and everything was presented so neatly and pretty. Every dish sparkled. Not really but to me everything in Cosmo sparkles :)\n\nI wasn't feeling well the day I came here because I was running off a total of four hours of sleep in two days and I had nothing but Crown and greasy junk food in my system. After my second small plate at Wicked Spoon and only my third glass of mimosas, I threw down my napkin. I was really; really SAD I didn't get to try EVERYTHING. That's what happens when you play too hard, you miss out on GOOD food!! :("

The selection of food was not as expansive, nor as impressive, as the first time I came here several years ago. Unfortunately, new is king on the Strip and Bacchanal is slaying (for a price, of course). I also like Studio B if you want to drive south.  Bellagio, Wynn, and Paris were previous greats for me, but they don't even come to mind when I think of Vegas buffet options anymore. Adding Cosmo to that list."

S"This is my favorite buffet place in Vegas and here's why:\n\nFood display - The appetizers, entrees, desserts are each individually served in their own little bowls or containers. Even though it's still mass produced, the feel is like it's a high class specialty restaurant where you serve yourself, and each dish was thoughtfully put together for you.\n\nVariety & Quality - We're talking bone marrow, fig appetizers by the salad, sushi, crab legs, prime rib, dim sum, gnocchi, shepherd's pie, bbq pork sandwiches made with steam bao, and even a custom mac & cheese bar!  Really something here for everybody, even for those who don't like buffets because they think the quality sucks. The quality of the food is better than some restaurants. Yup!\n\nDesserts - This is one of their biggest selling points, the perfect end to a wonderful meal.  They have beautiful pastries including macaroons and a gelato bar which is incredible!  Numerous varieties of cheesecakes and sugar free items too.  Just an awesome display that looks like a display advertising a French cake shop or a movie set.\n\nOverall, it's such a good foodie experience here it doesn't compare well with other Vegas buffets.  It's more like a fine tasting event where you get to go back for the food you really liked, and there's plenty of that."

For the $44 they charged, I would have been better off going to McDonalds,Circus Circus buffet OR JUST STARVE instead. \n\nThe bone marrow was the worst thing I've ever had, it was just a ridiculous amount of fat and the prime rib was flavorless. I even had the end piece of the prime rib. How do you mess that up??? They use to have mac n cheese and it was yummy! Now they replaced it with some cauliflower dish that looks exactly like the mac n cheese. Why would you do that?!?!?!?!? It's like they are just purposely pissing me off with this deception!!!!!!!!! One of my favorite dishes that they had was the pork belly sliders on mantao bread (Chinese white bread thingy) and again it was delicious. I even ate 5 in 1 sitting! Now it's GONE!!!!\nI had to force myself to eat enough to justify the $44 I sent. I ended up filling up on bread, yes you read that right, bread, sugar free cookies and ice cream. I still can't believe that a simple dish like spaghetti can be ruined but Wicked Spoon you proved me wrong! The so called clam pizza was tasteless. I just ended up eating dinner rolls. In fact if they had served King's Hawaiian rolls, then that would have been the best thing on the menu but since they didn't, the plain dinner rolls were good enough. They even messed up on the Korean short ribs. HOW DO YOU DO THAT?!?!?!?!?\n\nWhat makes me even more ANGRY is seeing people writing reviews about how great it is after going on the same day and eating the same crapI! I had to create an account just to share how disappointing this experience was."

S"seriously, this place is my new favorite vegas buffet.  the food is great and there is a ton of variety.  the things that pop out as most memorable to me are the mac and cheese bar (you can seriously have them make almost whatever you can imagine for mac and cheese.  blue cheese, cheddar, bacon, they can do a ton).  they also had a really good pasta section and pizza section that didn't have a ton of choices, but what they had tasted great.  they had chioppino which was really good too, and the extra sauce made it really good to dip other items into.  crab legs were tasty and were already cut so getting the meat out was nice and easy and they also had little dishes of butter for dipping.  the sushi was alright, i think the bellagio is still the winner in the sushi department.  however, they have a korean bbq part here and it has the kalbi ribs which i loved, along with cajun cooked shrimp.  they also have stuff i have not seen at other buffets such as big beef bones cut in half for those who like marrow.  the shrimp cocktails were very good, i probalby had like 20 of those alone haha.  the dessert bar here is absolutely amazing.  they have your typical cakes and stuff, but then they have little plastic shot glasses with mixes of stuff from fruit creme, to mousse, to fudge, to solid chocolate tops with a variety of toppings from fruit to gold leaf and they were all presented very well.  they have a gelato bar that blows the one at the mirage away which is always a big selling point of the mirage buffet to me.  but there are like 10-14 flavors here and the PB&J one is great, along with salted peanut and pistachio, but you can't go wrong with any flavor they offer\n\nonly things i did not like about this buffet are that it seems to be in the very back corner of the cosmo so you literally have to walk half a mile through the casino to get there, and they try to promote signing up for the players card there, but the card they give you is useless until you go to the actual players cards stations in the casino and have them activate a card for you.  but the buffet is excellent, and i will probably be back there when i am back next month"

S"I went here this past weekend because people were telling me this place is better than any other buffet places in vegas. So i gave it a try and to me it was disappointing. The food wasn't tasty at all and I was honestly expecting more variety of food there compare to other hotels. If i were to pick a favorite part of the meal, it would be nothing. And the service was bad as well. I would give this place only 2 stars."

S"My 2nd time eating here and thought that the place is pretty decent to try. I'd say that the lunch is worth the value at about $33 per person. \n\nI came here to eat my monies worth so it was all about the crab legs, prime rib, and chocolate covered strawberries. I had other items such as shrimp cocktail in a shot glass, kale salad, cake desserts, etc but I'd say go for the crab leg, prime rib, and chocolate covered strawberries. They're pretty out of this world.\n\nStaff I'd very attentive but too quick to clear the plates. Gf and I went for our 3rd round and our table was cleared. However they quickly got us new setting and everything was fine and dandy.\n\nI'd recommend trying this place once. For the price and wait, I'd highly recommend it."

S"I LOVE FOOD and Wicked Spoon did not disappoint!  Yes, it's pricey, but to me, worth it.  The decor was fabulous, food was delicious, fresh and high-quality and the desserts were to die-for!  Service was excellent and we really enjoyed our time here.  We ate here for lunch and there was such a wide range of entree selections , that you will have no problem finding what you're looking for.. and more.      Simple/cold caprese salads, smoked salmon, asian short ribs, and lamb ragout served in individual/neat serving plates.  I LOVED their dessert, most especially the macarons (my FAVORITE), chocolate covered delicacies and gelato bar!  HEAVEN!  Everything looked so beautiful.. definitely ate with my eyes first, then with my taste buds and they were both equally satisfied!"

We will check their taste buds when we get home. OMG they don\'t know anything about great food and great service. \nEVERYTHING was so delicious and the presentation was FABULOUS!  My eyes didn\'t know where to start or finish.  A big mahalo to our waitress (I\'m sad I can\'t remember her name) who told the pastry chef it was our anniversary and she wrote on a plate in chocolate "happy 25th anniversary". OMG what a wonderful way to start our next 25years. Mahalo Nui Loa Wicked Spoon for making our silver anniversary a very memorable event and we look forward to spending our golden anniversary with you!'

S'The Wicked Spoon Buffet at the Cosmopolitan is something a little different here in Las Vegas.  Mind you, I said, "a little".  \n\nWhile the selection here is pretty amazing, there are still issues with items not being properly labeled (aside from sometimes not having a label at all) and the slow service at the front cashier.\n\nAs far as being different, the items in the buffet aren\'t all that different but the way that they\'re served are.  Just about everything is served in little dishes "tapas style".  This is terrific if you want to have just a little of something but can be a real pain if what you wanted was 12 pieces of shrimp cocktail (as there are only 2 shrimp in each dish).\n\nThey serve King Crab...but as king crab tails.  Very interesting.  After looking into it, I found out that the tails were not usually served in restaurants until recently. Personally, I didn\'t even know that a king crab had a tail.\n\nAs with many other buffets here in town, there are salads, breads, different pasta dishes and meats as well as pizzas and asian selections.\n\nI think the Wicked Spoon is definitely a place to try while visiting Las Vegas but as a local, I have other buffets I\'ll go to before this one.  The quality of the food here is good and the buffet seems to be priced correctly for its offerings.\n\nAll said, it\'s OK.  This is Vegas.'

S"WOW...just a great place to eat. Mind you, I am not a fan of buffets for various reasons, but this place was awesome. I heard about it through yelp and other bloggers and I am so glad that my friends and I enjoyed our time here.\n\nWe arrived around 1230 and waited  about 40 minutes to get seated. The location is a bit tricky since it's hidden deep inside the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel, down a long, empty hall. The place was busy when we arrived (brunch) but the line went by pretty fast. \n\nOnce seated, our server started the first round of our unlimited mimosas. We collectively decided to pay the extra $8 each since hey, its unlimited! The orange juice seemed freshly squeezed and it had just the right ratios of champagne and juice. We were never without a full glass, and to that we were very appreciative.\n\nOn to the food....can I just say...YUM! Most buffets I've been either have large quatities of bland food or large quantities of salty food. This place was delicious! The presentation of each dish, especially those, in lil' individual servings were so good. I loved the lil baskets of fried chicken, or the mini mac and cheese, even the invidual apple crumb pies. I can't say enough good things about this place other than  it's worth the wait, money, and walk to eat here. If you're ever in vegas and planning to eat at a buffet, this place is definitely a must try."

S'Best buffet on the strip, and this is coming from a buffet-connoisseur like myself. No big deal....\n\n$29 gets you in for brunch (note: they close at 3pm to switch to dinner foods), and it\'s less than $10 for unlimited champagne/mimosas/bloody mary\'s. When they "switch" to dinner foods, they mean kick out all the fatty\'s who happen to be eating for hours and want to capitalize on dinner foods by staying until close. Heh.... \n\nHighlights of my meal: Kalbi, kalbi, kalbi, gigantic shrimp cocktail, great mimosas, chocolate passion fruit dessert with crunchy chocolate balls, and strawberries and whipped cream. Clearly didn\'t make my moneys worth in food but perhaps I did in drink. Can\'t wait to come back to try the rest of their food!'

S"I'll admit, I am a buffet snob. Wait, I mean WAS...\n\nI never knew what I was missing out on until I came to Wicked Spoon, against my will, with a bachelorette party. \n\nLet me just say - it changed my mind. Its really hip, and located in the newly opened Cosmopolitan, which in itself is fun to walk through. \n\nThe only part that didn't make sense to me was that you wait in line to pay, then you wait in line again while they try to seat you. This ended up being a bit messy and it just made more sense to me to have you pay once you are seated. But, honestly its not a deal breaker. They also add on 18% tip for large groups (I think over 6?) which seems excessive when you pay $40 already and they just get you drinks and clear your plates. But its Vegas!\n\nMy favorites: I loved the Asian Food bar, with everything from Dashi broth and noodles, to General Tsao Chicken. Every station served the food in little metal containers, in small portions, which keeps everything very clean and organized. \n\nThe dessert bar is amazing, and ever changing. They have the best sorbets (mango, lemonade, etc.) as well as cobbler, mini cones, and macaroons. \n\nOverall, I loved the ambiance, the food, and the people working at the stations are helpful and friendly. They even saved my friend's phone when she left it on the table and we took off. Hangovers -they always  cause problems..."

I guess I can see why this is the highest rated buffet in Vegas, although it has some tough competition from the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars.  \n\nThe strong points were definitely the breakfast foods and dessert.  Don't miss the french toast and banana pancakes!  Egg scrambles and made-to-order omelet bar are awesome too.  Did not spring for the bottomless mimosas ($47??  no thanks!)\n\nGenerally a great brunch buffet."

S"I'm giving this place 5 stars for the service. The food, 2 stars!\n\nOur last night in Vegas, I wanted to try this place in hopes I would be able to bypass my stomach flu. Went for dinner and thought I was feeling fine. After trying some food, the food seemed plain. The only flavorful things I felt were delicious was the fruits, salads, and some desserts. I remember trying the bone marrow, it seemed like they tossed salt and pepper and nothing else on it. My bf and I ended up tossing that away. Very disappointed. Most of the food seemed greasy and plain, where it made my stomach flu worse quickly and I was stuck eating healthy stuff at the buffet. \n\nOur server was amazing though and kept checking up on me and got me a ginger ale. She foresaw that I needed the ale and came out quickly with it. She even kept me company while my bf went to grab food. She reminded me of my mom taking care of me when I was sick. Two thumbs up to the service!\n\nI'll give this place a second try in hopes that they've improved with all the yelpers commenting about how mediocre the food is."

S"Both the Wynn and Bellagio buffets have had their day in the sun, but they now have to play second and third fiddle to Wicked Spoon, which I think is the best new buffet in Vegas. There's a lot of care put into the detail of the food here, which starts with the presentations. Many of the dishes are placed in individual pots or dishes. This is nice for two reasons: it maintains portion control and it also makes for easy pick up. \n\nSome of the plates I loved were:\n- The mac and cheese\n- Gnocchi\n- Yogurt parfait with honey and granola\n- Watermelon, honeydew, and cantaloupe (topped with cilantro and a sauce)\n- Korean BBQ ribs\n- Banh mi with pork belly in a steamed bun\n- Clams\n- All of the desserts!\n\nThere are many others that I can't even remember, but mostly everything was delicious!"

S"My girlfriend would always try to get me to go eat here but we would never find the time. \n\nIt wasn't until our last trip to Vegas that we decided to make time. Besides, we stayed at Vdara which is right next door to Cosmo so it wasn't too much of a hassle.\n\nThe wait at 1:30pm on a Saturday was surprisingly pretty short. A total of 45 minutes and we (table of 6) were sat and ready to eat. The buffet wasn't dissapointing, but didn't really have a huge wow factor either. Some few things that surprised me were the bone marrow and the angry mac n cheese. Those were yummy and to be honest, I wasn't really expecting bone marrow to be offered in any buffet. I just assumed that was some traditional home-made leftover food that families would make! Some people complain about it being bland...to which I say - you're eating bone marrow. It's not BBQ ribs (they also had kalbi ribs if flavor is what you want). Enjoy it how it is!\n\nBut what about the dessert bar? Surely that's what people really want when they go to buffets, right? I wasn't disappointed at all. Endless sweet & juicy chocolate strawberries, 10-12 varieties of gelato, and macaroons? :drool: \n\nThe downside to my experience was the server only came back once or twice and it was only for a split second at a time. We didn't even have time to ask him for refills on our drinks. He finally came back with refills when we were finishing our dessert and was getting ready to leave. Thanks BRO\n\nRegardless, I will definitely be back. It's different than the run-of-the-mill buffets on the strip and it still has a solid price range to warrant coming back."

(naive for thinking it wasn't going to take long to be seated on a holiday night?)\n\nThe leg of lamb was amazing--fresh carved, hot and juicy!\n\nBone marrow spread on some of their little toasted breads--delicious!\n\nI loved the assortments of pastas and starchy side dishes served in cute little dishes. \n\nHuge cheese selection!!\n\nThe sushi was ok, not that great.  Their shots of gaspacho were tasty and refreshing.\n\nDesserts galore!!!! I filled my plate up with all sorts of tasty treats from chocolate covered strawberries, cheesecake and gelato.\n\nBottom line: Long waiting time for dinner, but a nice selection of well-cooked food...as opposed to shorter waiting times, more food and less quality.

S"Went to the wicked spoon to try it out. After reading many reviews which put it with a good rating, i decided to try it out. Holy crap is it good. Between my fiancee and myself we tried many things and liked almost all of it. She got the one marrow and said it was good, just a bit greasy. She loved the crab legs. Me, I got some gnocchi in a cream sauce that was exceptional, the meatballs are fantastic, the Sheppards pie, the best I have had yet. But even with that, my 2 favorite things were the carnitas, served kind of in a deconstructed way and the fried chicken, utterly divine. So with all this great food, We decide to go for dessert. That is when things kind of went south. We found them to be a bit bland, a bit lacking in selection, basically just not as good as the Caesars's buffet, but a close second. If they fix the desserts, they could easily be neck and neck with the Caesar's Bacchanal buffet as the best in Las Vegas."

S"I've never been so dissatisfied with service, that the food became an afterthought. I've been to Las Vegas 6 times within the last 3 years and visited here each time. After my last experience here, I'll be taking a long break if I ever decide to go back. \n\nMy father and I ate here on 7/25 for brunch around 11am.  I'd say the capacity was about 2/3rds or less full.  For buffets, I only expect 2 things for service - that my plates are cleared in a timely manner and drinks are refilled. After being seated, I go to get my food first while my father stays behind and orders our drinks.  I'm away a good while since I take a look at all of the food stations to decide where to get started. Decided on some breakfast items and toasted a slice of bread.  When I get back to the table, only our bottle of glass water was dropped off.  For those that haven't been here before, they provide you a bottle of glass water to start you off with.  My father leaves to get his food and our waitress finally arrives with our order of a cup of coffee and two juices.  This was over 10 minutes since we were first seated.  Another note to those that haven't been here before is that the table that seats two is small and the big plates that they use take up about a little less than a quarter of it.  I finish my first plate and my glass of juice, and I go back to get more food.  I tell my dad to order another juice for me while I'm gone. When I came back, my plate wasn't cleared and the waitress didn't stop by to check on us.  In fact, she didn't pass by at all since she came back with the drinks.  My father flagged down the first person that passed by, which just so happens to be the lady that sat us. She mentions that she wasn't our server and calls the one who was down. Lo and behold, our server appeared with the quickness to finally clear my plate and refill my juice.  By this time, our water was less than half full and should have been refilled also. But it never was refilled our whole stay.  By the time our waitress came back, I was halfway done with my second plate.  I always overlook things like this and give our server the benefit of the doubt, but still no improvement.  Our area wasn't even full and I didn't see our server busy serving others except for a group of a dozen ladies with champagne who seemed more into taking selfies and chatting than eating. My third plate was dessert already. And when I came back, my second plate was still on the table! So was my father's first plate.  So remember what I said about the size of the plates and table? Well that equals a full table does it? Our table wasn't cleared until I was already done with dessert.  The thing that really bothered me was we were near the wall where the bussers would stack up cleared plates before taking them to be washed. I was thinking they were shorthanded, but seemed like they had enough time to talk story by the wall while our plates and well as others in our area weren't cleared yet.  Like I said in the beginning, all I expected was my plates to be cleared in a timely manner (preferable before I come back with my next plate) and drinks are refilled.  If my father didn't flag down the lady that sat us, who knows if our server would have ever come back? \n\nWe ate at two other buffets that week, at the Bellagio and Monte Carlo.  Service at Bellagio was excellent, even though it was packed.  Our server was efficient in refilling our drinks and I always came back with no plate sitting there.  Even at Monte Carlo, where drinks were self-serve from their fountain station, our plates were cleared in a timely manner.  At nearly $30 after taxes for brunch, I expect great service when the competition like Bellagio and Wynn provide that for $10 less. But was we got was pretty much non-existent."

We got to the line a tad before noon and it was still really short.  We walked around to get a scope of the place.  There was an area with Asian foods, carving station, and breakfast area, and two islands on either side of the buffet for the salad and cheese bar, and the dessert bar.  I love how many of the dishes are served in small dishes.  The shrimp cocktails was in a dish with on 2 shrimps, but they were really good, too bad there were no crab legs.  Also, the prime rib was delish!  It was really juicy and there were different kinds of condiments to choose from, I chose the chimichurri.  I also loved that there were chocolate dipped strawberries and gelato in the dessert area.  My only disappointment was that our server wasn't really timely with taking away our plates.  Other than that, this is a definitely a buffet worth your money."

S"From the outside the place looks great, but I'm all about the food quality more than the presentation and I've got to say Wicked Spoon still needs some improvement. \n\nI tried almost everything they had to offer, and I was glad they at least had crab legs and shrimp,  if I'm going to pay $40 /person I better be eating some seafood. The Korean short ribs were just ok, the quality of the meat was not that great. The fried oysters were cold when I got them, and when I tried a fresh batch they cooked it didn't really have any flavor. The mini sloopy joe burgers were pretty good, but I didn't pay this price to eat burgers. The prime rib I got to say was pretty tender and cooked well, but I'm not a huge fan of prime rib so needless to say I wasn't impressed by that either. \n\nMoving on to the desserts..the presentation looked all so lovely, but most of the ones in the little tiny cups weren't that great. The flan was pretty good and not too sweet. They had these tiny orange macarons which were pretty yummy. My favorite dessert was the ice cream, which I believe it was the caramel chocolate one I had. The ice cream was rich and creamy and probably by far the best thing I think I had at the buffet. \n\nSo I was not impressed by them at all, I essentially paid $40 to eat really really good ice cream, which I could have gotten a whole bucket worth. I still recommend the M Buffet at the M Resort. Their buffet not only includes unlimited Wine and Beer, but their crab legs are Warm!! And all their desserts are yummy, especially the creme brulee."

S"The Wicked Spoon Buffet is located in the far depths of the Cosmopolitan hotel. Could it be placed in a more remote location?! It's hard to compare this buffet to others, but I think it goes on the same caliber as the Wynn Buffet but I can't compare because they just do different cuisines and different things. \n\nThis buffet is a pricey penny at $35 for dinner when there is not that much seafood at all. Dinner starts at 5pm and they close from 2pm to 5pm I believe. \n\nThe sushi sucks here, so don't expect much. It's true what other reviewers stated that they put most of their food items in individual bowls/plates/pots. So it's already portioned out individually which is good for not wasting. But at the same time, if you only want very little of it to try you can't do that either. I thought the food being placed in individual bowls and plates was a neat idea until I got there and 3 or 4 items takes up your entire plate! So you just have to make more trips but I guess that's good because it makes you really rethink if you really want the food item. \n\nTheir food is a different type of caliber and cuisine. There were items like bone marrow, gnocchi, couscous, lamb sliders, fish and chips with waffle fries, etc... The only seafood that I remember them having was skinny/short king crab legs and mussels. I believe that was it? \n\nThe item that stole the show for me here at the WSB was the dessert section! I'm not a huge dessert person either but they had some very unique items here like the ALMOND JOY GELATO! Mhmmm that was soo delicious! They had like 15 different flavors of gelato for your picking which was nice. \n\nThe service by the food staff was sparse, i hardly saw any of them behind the counters and I would have questions or there was no tongs for food. \n\nI'm deducting a star because of the price of the buffet, the food service and location of how far into Cosmopolitan it is located. And also the food quality was either no taste or overcooked and we went a little after 5pm. A lot of the food items looked better than they tasted which is too bad. And there's hardly any seafood to warrant the price tag."

S"Please, for the love of all that is delicious in the world, if you're in Vegas please visit this buffet as it was one of the most visually gorgeous buffets I've had the pleasure of trying.  \n\nWe were in Vegas for the 2013 IT Expo and I'd come armed with a list of places to see, restaurants to try and shows to see.\n\nThe ridiculously long walk from the taxi drop-off point will help you justify eating absolutely anything you want to once you get there, and the walk through the stunning interior of The Cosmopolitan Hotel is quite a treat in itself.\n\nIt's not the cheapest buffet in the world but let's face it, you're in Vegas and this buffet isn't a Golden Corral food trough.  The d\xc3\xa9cor is stunning, however don't feel pressured to class yourself up as we saw a varied mix of jeans, flip-flops, touristy IVegas t-shirts, bow ties and diamonds. \n\nThe place is packed, so mentally prepare yourself for a few minutes wait.  We were fortunate enough to arrive seconds ahead of a huuuuge Birthday party group, therefore our wait was better than someone arriving a few minutes later.  \n\nOnce inside, the staff were professional and helpful and we didn't feel as if they were trying to rush us out the door.\n\nThe wine menu is decent, the cocktails are varied and the soft drink options are limited but will keep your kids happy.\n\nI honestly don't know how often they change their menu, but there's a healthy amount of variety on offer to make you feel that you're chowing at a buffet that's on steroids. \n\nMost of the buffet items are already portioned out into bite sized dishes, giving you the false impression that you're not eating as much as you are.  It also lets you feel like a giant food monster tearing through a land of impossibly perfect micro food.  Indulge your inner giant.\n\nWe went for dinner and sampled, amongst other things:\n* A wonderful range of soups and salads\n* A decent seafood bar including a nice zingy ceviche, anorexic crab legs, baby octopus salad and a boring prawn cocktail heavy on the tomatoes\n* Some nicely done carvery options including the expected lamb, beef and pork with all the predictable sides, prime rib and a magnificent beef marrow on toast\n* A standard range of Asian cuisine, including cute mini-Chinese takeout boxes containing an average quality Chow Mein\n* The obligatory Mexican and Italian options, heavy on the carbs\n* Some excellent cheese options which, although not an extensive selection, are surprisingly varied and very well selected\n* An outstanding gelato bar and some stunningly presented desserts that you will tear through like a whirlwind (although no cr\xc3\xa8me br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, meh)\n\nOverall I don't think everything on offer is as top of the line as it should be, and I didn't feel that there were enough high end items to completely justify the price, however there are some items that are standalone in quality by themselves.  \n\nThere are a huge amount of carb-heavy filler items, all excellently prepared and presented, and the dessert options are glorious.\n\nWorth a visit, won't change your life BUT you'll remember it fondly and I suspect you might add it to your list of Vegas places to revisit."

S"Here's the order you should go for Vegas buffets:\n\n- your hotel.\n- Wicked Spoon\n- Bacchanal (Caesar's Palace)\n\nWhy? Because then you'll be working up to what is the best and what is just average. Wicked Spoon is, unfortunately, just average. My fiance and I went in the wrong order. I'm sure my review would be glowing if we hadn't hit Bacchanal first. But we did. And then when we went to Wicked Spoon, we were disappointed.\n\nThe pros of it are that there are SO many good desserts. I could spend all day at the dessert area. There was duck ravioli (not great) and some Korean short rib (pretty good). I even tried their sketch lo mein. There was also some bone marrow that I wanted to try, but couldn't muster up the guts to do it. Something about eating the marrow kind of bothers me. But I'm not sure how I'm supposed to be a foodie without experiencing it at least once. So maybe next time.\n\nI would come back to Wicked Spoon because it was just, as I already said, average. It wasn't too pricey, compared to other places, and we could add on unlimited mimosas/champagne/bloody marys and make it the same price as some other buffets."

S'In noticing that many of the reviews for this place come from frequent "Vegaseers," I wanted to drop some knowledge from the other end of the spectrum.  \n\nI\'ve been to Las Vegas only twice.  That\'s two times.  One, two times.  The first was over New Years (and don\'t even get me started on the ridiculous omg-I-like-so-totally-almost-died bit).  The point is, my friends and I were searching for a both delicious and memorable way to usher in the new year.  Thanks to the magic of smart phones and Yelp, we ended up deciding on The Wicked Spoon.  It was the mac and cheese bar that pushed us over the edge into spoon territory after a sweat-inducing process of elimination.\n\nWhen we got there, the line was kind of long, but what do you expect on New Year\'s Eve in one of the biggest party towns in the nation?  But the wait and the $40-ish that we had to deal with were quickly wiped from my memory as soon as I put the first wicked spoonful into my mouth.\n\nThe food is incredible.  I\'ve been to great buffets before, but this one ran circles around even the revered Castaway in Burbank, CA.  And it\'s not just the taste, but the variety of food.  I\'ve never seen such a spread prepared with such care for the culinary arts.  That sounds cheesy, and avoiding all possible "cheese" puns right now, I\'m just gonna say that every bite of food literally felt crafted with a love for cooking.  It\'s true.  And as excited as I was for the mac and cheese bar, I hardly even had any of it.  I was too busy trying small helpings of, well, everything.  They have fresh beef and chicken that they slice off the bone for you, and it\'s juicier than most fine restaurants I\'ve been to.  The potatoes are ridiculous.  And even the pita and hummus was something I went back for.\n\nAnd the desserts.... Oh, the desserts.  Where to begin?  The chocolate covered strawberries.  This is coming from someone who worked at Godiva for a year and personally hand-dipped berries every morning.  The strawberries are amazing.  Dipped in chocolate and then rolled in either peanuts or Oreos, they\'re just so fresh.  And a huge selection of mini raspberry cheesecakes, apple pies, eclairs, dulce de leche... Saving room for dessert is a challenge in itself, but well worth the grueling effort.\n\nSo needless to say, on my second trip to Las Vegas this past weekend, The Wicked Spoon was at the top of our list for a Saturday night dinner.  Vegas is a city filled with chance takers, but I\'d rather gamble with my money than with my stomach.  The Wicked Spoon was sunshine and fairies and care bears and Chuck Norris in food form, so why try anything new and risk disappointment?'

S'This is officially my favorite Vegas buffet!\n\nWicked Spoon is also wicked expensive so major thanks to the sugar daddy BF for the multiple trips to this yummy buffet :)\n\nEven though we dined for both lunch and dinner, we were lucky enough to show up during non-busy times. No line to wait in, no crowd to compete against for food, and plenty of empty tables around us so the wait staff paid plenty attention to us.\n\nMy biggest gripe about many buffets are the lack of creativity and taste for the dishes that don\'t contain animal products. As a vegan, I\'m often stuck with something boring. But in my first plate alone, I was wowed by three specific items: Kale Salad, Green Papaya Salad, and Sweet Potato Pur\xc3\xa9e.\n\nThe Kale Salad had this citrus-y sweet vinaigrette mixed with pepitas and dried cranberries. Very bright in colors and taste! I could eat a full plate of the Kale Salad and be so happy :) http://su.pr/1lzRQB\n\nThe Green Papaya Salad was perfectly al dente in texture and mixed with green beans, green onion, tomatoes, and peanuts. The dressing had a hint of sweet and a bit tart which marinaded well with all the ingredients. I even opted to add tofu to soak up some of that delicious flavor. http://su.pr/3imgLq\n\nThe Sweet Potato Pur\xc3\xa9e was like candy! Smooth and vanilla-y, I definitely went back for seconds on this one. http://su.pr/2qgxuv\n\nThe only less than great items were the avocado rolls and the veggie rolls offered at the sushi area. It wasn\'t bad, it just was the standard mediocre buffet-style sushi.\n\nI really appreciated that the dessert area contained non-dairy options. The Mango Sorbet and Raspberry Sorbet were super delicious! http://su.pr/2C6VL6\n\nDuring our dinner visit, many of the lunch items were still available but I was happy to see that they added more vegan friendly things including:\n- A garbanzo bean, tomato, and cucumber salad\n- An Israeli couscous salad\n- An artichoke and hearts of palm salad\n- Hummus, baba ganush, and pita chips\nhttp://su.pr/290Jjf\n\nAll items were good but I might note that the hummus and baba ganush was a bit on the thin side. But I do wanna point out the olive bar which had these amazing tasty olives. Specifically, the bright green ones which were more sweet than tart. There was also these super large red olives that tasted like they have been smoked...almost like salami. Yum!\n\nSo the price is kinda up there, especially for someone who doesn\'t take take advantage of all the meat and seafood offerings. But out of all the Vegas buffets that I\'ve been too, Wicked Spoon is definitely at the top of my list!\n\nAlso, beware of the mimosas. One sip and it\'s like "geez, would you like any orange juice with that champagne?" Still good though. You just gotta be prepared for it :)'

Not as many varieties as bacchanal but quality wise the food is good.\n\nMy suggestion go eat buffet for brunch. $10 cheaper than dinner price and go to a nice restaurant for dinner.  So many high end restaurants that you need to try at least one."

S"The Wicked Spoon has abolished my generalization of buffets.   As I perused the cornucopia of culinary genius all I could think of was how am I going to try all of the food here.  This buffet is a collection of small plates and not just bulk trays of food in a steam table.  I have never seen such fantastic presentations at a buffet!\n\nI was only able to try a small portion of what they had but everything was fantastic.   I started off with the eggs benedict, sushi, Korean spare ribs & two types of homemade sausages.  The cut to order slab bacon was a nice touch.  I wasn't in the mood for lamb chops but I had to indulge.  When would I ever have lamb chops at a breakfast buffet again?  Everything was fantastic.   \n\nDue to my indulgence the previous evening in copious amounts of alcohol I could only stomach (3) plates and desert was out of the question.  For all the desert lovers out there they had a gigantic desert area."

I didn't really enjoy it to be honest. In my opinion, there wasn't very much variety. Nothing really stood out to me taste wise and I didn't really go back for any seconds."

S'If all buffets were like Wicked Spoon, I might become a buffet guy.  \n\nThe thing about me is that I don\'t like to gorge.  Eating pounds and pounds of mediocre food just to get my money\'s worth doesn\'t appeal to me.  I prefer to taste, not gorge.  I like to taste lots and lots of little items and experience as many flavors as possible.\n\nAnd if you\'re a taster like me, Wicked Spoon is heaven.\n\nWicked Spoon is the first buffet where the majority of the food comes in individually portioned, small and bite-sized dishes.  This made me a very happy boy.\n\nAside from this unique quirk, Wicked Spoon is a fairly conventional Las Vegas buffet.  On the other hand, it\'s quite gorgeous, with more chandeliers and more stylish decor than most.  There\'s typically a line to enter, but I managed to avoid it by dining at off hours -- 7:30am for breakfast, and 5:30pm for dinner.  \n\n(Side note -- I had free passes to the buffet thanks to my Cosmopolitan rewards program, so I got to experience both breakfast and dinner at no cost -- sweet!  But expect to pay through the nose if you purchase a buffet pass yourself.)\n\nThe foods run the gamut in terms of style and quality.  The strengths lie in the desserts, I think.  I loved the macarons and apple cobbler and molten chocolate cake and endless flavors of gelato.  Every single cake and tart was perfect.\n\nThe savory foods were a little more mixed.  The vaguely "Asian" foods like the General Tso\'s chicken and pork fried rice were tasty but bland.  (Also, who eats buffet-grade sushi anyway?)  Same with the Mexican foods.\n\nOn the other hand, the American-style foods, like the fried chicken and roasted bone marrow and salmon with pea puree, were quite excellent.  The various salads were fresh and delicious, too -- especially the beet salad, asparagus salad, various takes on a green salad (spinach and kale), and that kickass caprese.\n\nI could spend hours detailing every dish I tasted, but that would be pointless, since Wicked Spoon\'s selection of foods changes on the reg.  You\'ll have to pay it a visit and see for yourself!  Just be sure to bring your appetite.'

S"Came in on a weekday. Bad idea. The food was kind of dry. I even saw the cooks moving the food around to keep the sauces from settling. Friend came for a second time on the weekend and reported to me that the food was a lot better and fresher, but there was a wait on the weekends. The food looked better than it tasted, for the most part. Overall, for the price you pay, which was about $29 or so after taxes, it's still a pretty good buy. \n\nThe only thing I found annoying was that many of the selections were already in their own dishes. So if you wanted to grab a lot of food at once, it was sort of impossible unless you were good at Tetris and knew how to stack like a boss."

S'I would love to see the research behind the cost-effectiveness of ramekins over large plates. Dishwashing vs food waste. Seriously, I\'ll bet it\'s fascinating. No, I\'m not kidding!\n\nAnyway, so, love the ramekins. And I appreciate the variety and uncommon takes on common classics. Like truffle scalloped potatoes. "Angry" mac and cheese (spicy). Prime rib next to bone marrow (which was surprisingly flavorless). And actually, I had that complaint about a number of the dishes. Looked great on the little placards, but a little bland on the spoon. I made myself a nice combo of a veal slider, a piece of underripe brie and some sauce from the aforementioned truffle potatoes. The dessert "shooters," while again, gorgeous, all kind of tasted the same....\n\nWhich is not to say don\'t go here--it is by FAR the best buffet I\'ve ever been to, and if you give yourself a little time, you can happily eat yourself into a food coma.'

The set is so upscale. At least to me. Pretty upscale for a buffet. Upscale buffet? Nice...\n\nWe also got a nice bottle of red wine as well for $20. We just had to celebrate that way. \n\nI tried their mushroom truffle, their lobster pasta, and I freaked when I found out they had a mac and cheese station! Yes, i went a little crazy at the mac and cheese station. \n\nThis time, I was able to REALLY try the dessert table. The ice cream and pastry chef was so friendly, fun, and enthusiastic! He helped us pick an ice cream and suggested some great things. So here's the scoop on the ice cream flavors (haha! scoop! pun was intended):\n\nblood orange-if you like grapefruit it tastes like grapefruit. Not strong grapefruit. a mild grapefruit.\n\nbiscotti-tastes like a biscotti and is super delish! it goes GREAT with their molten lava cake.\n\nalmond joy-need i say more? i thought so..\n\nthat's it! get crazy here guys! it's well worth it!"

S'Better than Bacchanal?\n\n1. wicked spoon 2. bacchanal 3. bellagio 4. aria 5. wynn \n\nthat\'s my top 5 in that order.\n\nBacchanal vs Wicked Spoon!  Fight!!\n\nRound 1  - Decor\n\nNew round from my regular selection.  This place looks and feels awesome.  Doesn\'t help that a wedding party with a beautiful bride and groom was sitting near us.  Seriously, if a couple sees a hotel buffet glamorous enough to hold their special occasion at, then its a pretty darn nice establishment.  It was just a beautiful place to sit and eat at.  You also don\'t hear the noises of slot machines and bonus chimes echoing within the dinning establishment.  The bathrooms were large and clean.  I wish my house\'s bathroom looked like that.\n\nBacchanal is a classy modern day retro feel.  You have the textured yellow and orange seats with translucent square glass separators everywhere.  Sorta feels like the threshold of the 70\'s and the 80\'s.  The buffet area was well lit and visible from most of the corners of the room.  Outside was a view of the pool and the pretty people that walked by, something you don\'t get at wicked spoon.  Overall, a swanky place to eat at.\nwinner - Wicked Spoon\n\nRound 2 - seafood\n\nSeafood really belongs to the M or the Rio but lets compare these guys.  Wicked Spoon really has a limited selection to offer.  Crawfish, cold crab legs, and prawns are what sticks out in my mind; however, they do it well.  The cold crab legs are nothing special really.  I\'m starting to believe that all these buffets purchase their crab legs from the same shipping crate that gets shipped over from Long Beach.  If any dares tell me that Buffet\'s A crab legs are better quality than Buffet\'s B, i\'d like to sell them some "vintage" dollar bills for $10.  Lets clump sushi in this round, cause we like sushi.  They have a miso soup station which is very nice to have.  Prepping  your stomach for sushi with miso is always good.   The sushi selection  (dragon, tiger, ginger something, spicy tuna, etc) are a much BETTER selection than Bacchanal.  It\'s quality is also better as you can see the chef\'s prepping for it right there and seemingly knowing what to do.  I do like their creamy wasabi as well.\n\nBacchanal has so much to offer at it\'s seafood station.  They have little dishes that enhances some of their seafood offers.  Do not go there without trying their scallop spinich dish.  Soo freagin good.  There\'s an entire station dedicated to these unique dishes.  Once you get into the crab legs and oysters, they serve an assortment of dressing to go with it.  Everything is fresh and delicious to eat.  Their sushi is Sub-par.  (Par - average/mean/baseline).  Yeah, i said it...subpar.  You can go to sushi-boy or some place off flamingo rd to get sushi after bachannal if you really want it.  With that said, they still win.  (That hurts because I\'m a big sushi guy).\nSeafood - bachannal.\n\nRound 3 - carvery\n\nThis one is going to be tough.  Wicked spoon had so much going for it.  Thick hickory smoke apply bacon, the freagin bone marrow, and a near perfectly done prime rib.  Let\'s not forget the crispy chinese pork with hoisin sauce.  so good.  They had sausage links that I did not try, but I bet it would have been just as good since the rest of the meats were terrific.  What hurts them here is not offering (at least when I went) a lamb dish.  yeah, maybe you won\'t care for it, but its just one of those things that stands out when comparing buffets.  Quality of meat is excellent though and i wish they had a plated surf and turf station like the Aria next door.  \n\nBacchanal, if you\'ve read my other post, was alright.  It really is not its forte.  The lamb is probably the best thing they have.  The prime rib is slightly better than average but not at the level of the wynn.  I would venture to say they\'re about the same.  Wagyu beef is not impressive if it\'s made into a slider.  If you\'re going to eat that Wagyu beef slider, share with a friend first and see if you can really spot the difference.  Probably taste the same as if I would have gotten it from BJs.  They have a chinese station as well, but it\'s really not as good as wicked spoon.  I believe wicked spoon even serves chow fun, but i might be mixing that up with bachannal.  \nwinner - wicked spoon\n\nround 4 - variety\n\nThis is wicked spoons round.  there are so many dishes that I don\'t eat cause they sound expensive.  My friend literally said, this is a plate I would order outside at a 4 star restaurant.  This dude works for the A\'s.  Anyways, Bacchanal had some unique dishes like the wagyu beef, spinach scallop, & chicken and waffle, but they pale in comparison with wicked spoon.  Wicked spoon - custom BYO mac and cheese (delicious), truffle polenta something, chinese roasted pork,  ramen station, braised beef/pork tacos, a bunch of other things...go look at peoples pics.  Yeah it really isn\'t a comparison wicked spoon wins.\nwicked spoon\n\nRound 5 - dessert N/A cause i only had gelato\n\nGo to wicked spoon @ $50.'

By the time we were seat, my friend and I were already starving since we both haven't eaten anything for the whole day. After trying a little bit of everything, I thought many of the dishes were a little bland. The most memorable thing there was the desserts. Although they were a little too sweet for my taste, I really really liked it!

However, there is nothing special about it.  The line was also crazy long, and the service a bit less than Vegas-best.\n\nIf you are looking for a good deal for food in the Cosmo, do do the Wicked Spoon.

S'Is negative stars possible?\n\nWe went for dinner on 12/26 with a party of 4, one was a toddler, one an infant.  Got in line 7:30pm, paid around 9pm, seated at 9:15pm.  Being that the place closes at 9pm, we asked the cashier specifically if food stocking of the buffet would stop. The cashier said exactly "as long as people are eating, food will continue to be stocked until 10:15 pm."\n\nImmediately after seating, at 9:15pm I go to get sushi and the cut rolls are all gone.  They are not brining or making anymore.  After eating a bit at 9:35pm I go to get crab legs and they are out and not brining any more out.\n\nSo I decide to speak to the manager.  I have no problem with running out of food or not stocking a buffet after your normal closing time, but my issue was the information the cashier provided was inaccurate.  Had we been told running our might be a possibility, we may have gone elsewhere.  There was still quite a line behind us when we paid too.\n\nEven before I could get my entire comment out, the manager cut me off and said "Sir, everyone has had an hour to eat." I explained that was not my issue.  When I explained the sushi cut rolls were gone right when we were seated, he responded "Sir, we do not make any rolls in house, they are all brought in, when we run out, we run out."  Really?  The $20 buffet in my neighborhood makes their cut rolls in house and a $50 Vegas buffet does not?  The same explanation was given for the crab legs.  He reiterated that everyone had an hour to eat already.  I then showed my 9:15pm receipt and my seating was at 9:15pm.  My watch showed 9:38pm.  He responded, "that\'s still 45 minutes."  Really, in what Elementary math class does that equate to 45 minutes of eating time for me?\n\nBasically it was one excuse after another while cutting me off.  Finally, I explained that my issue is not with the lack of food, but with the information the cashier provided.  I guess the manager snapped.  He said "leave now and I\'ll refund you your money."  \n\nHe didn\'t say IF you leave now, or give any kind of choice.  Essentially he kicked my family out and refunded our money.  I guess that\'s better than being kicked out period, but definitely not what I expect from a Vegas buffet with my toddler and infant with me.\n\nAll I was expecting was an apology or "I\'ll go check with the food staff about the supply" and I would have been ok.  I would have been happy with an apology and a small 10%-15% discount.  In the end, no apology, just excuses and accusations.\n\nService: 5/5 for the actual server.  Nice and friendly day after Christmas.  Was working past normal closing time.  Too bad we were kicked out before being able to tip him.\n-100/5 for the manager.  Completely douche who can\'t manage the operations of a restaurant.  If you will run out of food, cut off the line and stop seating people.  You\'re in for a long night if you stay open with a half stock buffet.\n\nFood: 1/5 The food was bleah.  The salmon was cold.  None of the chefs making food seemed like they wanted to be there.  Maybe it was because it was the night after Christmas, maybe it was because of the time, but the food was generally tasteless.\n\nAmbience/location: 2.5/5 Average as far as Vegas buffets go.  It is kind of out of the way.  No matter, I won\'t be coming back here. \n\nWorst Vegas buffet experience ever.'

S"I believe this place captivates and lured people because of the decorations and how they serve their foods in exquisite silverware rather than investing in the quality of the food itself.. There selection on food varies from pea-pods or chow mien in a Chinese to-go carton, California rolls if you craved sushi, mediocre pasta, and a chunk of lamb or pork.They decorate the meat section with bone marrow, but the lamb meat itself is cover with blood. So much for a medium-well piece right? Salads, soups, feta cheese and cranberry salad was mostly it. They had a cook who will cook up some calms, mussels, & shrimp in your choice of butter. A pile of snow-crab legs and cocktail sauce. The dessert deserves a one star, there ice cream is exceptionally delicious and macarons tasted just about right, but they were limited. The mocha, moose, sugary tiramisu, cheesecake,  panne cotta, were contained in a sample shot-size cup, not the best, I rather have a piece and use a fork to eat it. \n\nBut overall, the food beyond low-graded, disgusting--no flavor, and  after the first plate your just wondering why you wasted $35 for tonight's meal. Service is okay, they clean up your mess the second you leave the table. \n\nBye wicked spoons. ):"

S'Not a big buffet person, but kudos to Wicked Spoon for putting out their foods in smaller portions. A food waster like me who just likes to try one bite of each thing, this made me feel less guilty not eating everything.\n\nThe lines can be quite long, however, our group of 7 only waited about 30 minutes on a Saturday night. Because it was a "holiday weekend", they upped the charge to $45 a person. Quite pricey, and definitley not worth it for me. No difference in food, except the cashier mentioned there was turkey.\n\nWe sat at a high table which made it a bit tougher to get in and out, but appreciated the decor and set up of this place.\n\nBuffets are a waste of $ for me, as I don\'t indulge in prime rib and crab legs like the majority of people. However, my girlfriends said the prime rib was one of the best they had (not just at a buffet), and enjoyed the crab legs.\n\nI sampled just about everything except for the meats. There is an Asian station with LA Kalbi, various meats with veggies, but I only wanted to try their salt and pepper calamari. Waited nearly 10 minutes for it, but it was worth it. You get about 3 pieces in a little cute frying basket. They were typical calamari, but good to have as part of the meal. The sushi here is absolutely terrible. The rice is overcooked and hard, possibly from staying out so long.\n\nThey had a variety of meats and cheeses, that I enjoyed, although I wish there was some bread or crackers to enjoy it with. Their clam chowder was really good too. My favorite of course was the pizza, which are tiny slices, perfect for me. There was a french onion, sausage and veggie, and a margherita. All very tasty. The stromboli was really good too.\n\nTheir shrimp and grits, although looks really good, the grits were way too salty for me. I was super bummed they didn\'t have the bone marrow everyone raved about, and was dissapointed with the mac and cheese station. Although it\'s really cool to have any type of protein, veggie, and cheese in your mac and cheese, it was just typical orecchietta pasta, pan cooked with pasta and meats. Very heavy, and a larger portion than I had expected.\n\nTheir dessert station was sub-par, but did enjoy the choices of having a scoop of gelato. Had 3 different kinds, and the coffee was my favorite.\n\nUnfortunately, our waitress was MIA the whole night. We got our drinks in the beginning, and over an hour later, we had to flag her down for a refill.\n\nOverall, a decent experience. Glad I tried it, but I\'d definitley rather have 9 Earl Sandwiches for the price of this buffet.'

S"Just left and I'm extremely full. Please note, the food deserves at least 4 stars, but I had some issues with the workers. \n\nI enjoyed the foods from the Italian, salad, and sea food stations. Everything I tried made me clear my plate. But, my issues (and lower star rating) come from the lack of an interesting Asian station, and there was no one at the Mac&cheese station... Disappointment. \n\nAlso, there was a lack of professionalism at the dessert station, for 2 employees were arguing loudly. F-bombs flying and very poor choice of language for an area with children!! \n\nI highly recommend the wicked spoon and it's food. Hopefully it can get its employees under control."

S"Delicious meats at the carving station, especially the prime rib and lamb.  The seafood was also nice and fresh.  The lamb Panini was also delicious.  Yummy macaroons, gelato and lemon tart. The Caesar salad was a bit over dressed where it was a bit soggy.  The roasted pork belly was disappointing - tough and the skin wasn't crisp.  I wish I had room to try the other things but that was all I was able to cover.  Well worth the price just for the carving station, seafood and dessert!  The great thing is that they also have a $20 takeout option.  The container looked like it was a good size so, although you won't be able to fill with a ton of options, definitely worth it for $20"

With that being said, they have a nice, tasty variety of food although they don't have as much as the other buffets. They only have snow crab as a seafood option as well as other tapa style options (ex. shrimp ceviche, blacked tuna..that sorta thing). So if you're looking for AYCE seafood, skip out on this place. All the food here is done and served tapa style so you'll have to make several trips considering you can only fit so many little plates on a large plate. Most of the food I tried, I loooved!

S"Okay... so there are about 1,900+ reviews that have been written before me so no, I don't expect to be original or anything. I'm seriously just writing this for myself so I know what to expect/anticipate the next time I come around. And believe me there will be another visit to Wicked Spoon when I'm in Vegas. :P  But feel free to read it anyways! \n\nI came here around 1:00PM on a Saturday with a group of 6 people because we were all starving. And who doesn't go to a buffet at least once when you're in Vegas? \n\nOriginally, we were supposed to have 10 people and thus when we got in line and was asked the number of people in our party, we told the staff 10. We ended up skipping the long line, paid extra 15% for gratuity(applicable to groups of 8 or more), and was seated fairly quickly to our surprise. YAY! \n\nLet's get eating shall we? \n\nDisclaimer: My inner child is indeed a fatty but I by no means tried everything that was out there. These are just a few I jotted down during my eating, sitting, piling-my-plate routine: \n\nMATSUTAKE SHOYU RAMEN: ew. don't get it. :( It was bland... I liked the earthiness that came from the mushrooms but aside from that, it was a waste of tummy space. \nWATER SPINACH WITH GARLIC: Nom! Can't go wrong with vegetables and galric tehe :3\nSTEAMED CLAM WITH WHITE WINE, TOMATOES, GARLIC, AND PARSLEY: It was pretty good. simple, clean, deilsh. Plus it was fun forking out the meaty bits from the clams. \nDUCK CONFIT RAVIOLI: pretty good. The flavor was rich, though by the time I got to my ravioli, it was a bit cold :( I think the sauce was made of brown butter and butternut squash, which complimented the ravioli well. Again, try to get this when it just comes out because dry cold pasta is unappetizing. \nBRAISED SHORT RIB WITH COMMUNITY GRAIN POLENTA: Not my favorite. It had a savory taste to it, but the polenta was a bit too grainy for me. \nASIAGO GNOCCHI: Love. Love love love! Every piece of gnocchi yielded this cheesy goodness that I couldn't get enough of. I had to pace myself to prevent from gobbling them down in order to really appreciate the taste. \nBROCCOLINI RABE: can't go wrong with broccolini either! \nKALE SALAD: probably one of my favorite vegetable based sides. It was seasoned well and I loved how fresh it tasted. \nCURRY ROASTED CAULIFLOWER: meh... a bit too soggy for me. \nSALMON PLATE: don't get it. I love salmon and this was just a dishonor to all the fishies in the sea. \nROASTED SWEET POTATOES: love! simple and sweet! \nLEG OF LAMB: It tasted good for something found at a buffet. Cooked with just the perfect amount of redness too. The only thing was that it quickly got tough and dry as time passed... I like to be able to enjoy my food slowly but I couldn't really eat it because my knife wouldn't cut through :( \n\nDesserts: GET THE GELATO! It's soooo worth it! Other desserts weren't as great sadly, but feel free to taste a bit of everything!\n\nOverall impression: pretty yummy. Beautiful presentation of the food. Though the price tag of ~40.00 was a bit excessive, it was worth the experience and the overall quality of the food.\n\nI was in love with the fact that most of the food was portioned out in small individual dishes already so you can easily get a little taste of everything :) I wasn't too happy with the fact that I waited a good amount of time before my cranberry juice came out, but that's minor. \n\nBe sure to anticipate a wicked food coma by the end of the mea and happy noming :D"

S'Wicked Spoon is the Cosmo\'s buffet on the Strip. It was $25 for lunch. Their selections were pretty standard with the salad, carving, brunch and omelette station, asian, italian, and dessert.  The setting is pretty cool with a black and orange color scheme. So, let\'s talk about the food.The only items that were memorable was the grilled house cured bacon, congee, and bone marrow. The fried chicken were seasoned with curry powder which tasted weird to me. The pork fried rice was bland and the shrimp "takoyaki-esque" balls were undercooked. They got some unique foods like a goat cheese and lavender panna cotta and a watermelon slice marinated in sriacha and lime. I thought most of the food here was pretty rich tasting (i.e. garlic bread, mushrooms gratin, eggs benedict). Even their salads were pretty overdressed that the salad was shining with olive oil. I will say this though...This buffet wins on presentation. The chicken were served in small fry baskets and the fried rice was in a chinese take-away box. I would probably give this place another chance and try go for dinner to see if its better. Oh btw, DO NOT eat the gnocchi here. The sauce tasted like the canned sloppy joe sauce i had the week before...'

S'My friends and I LOVE Wicked Spoon! We come here every time we go to Las Vegas. We\'ve tried other well-known buffets and nothing compares! All the food is well-made, high quality, and presented beautifully. For example, the banger n mash (available at breakfast/brunch) has a dollop of mash , then the gravy poured over it, then the banger placed on top of that along with some steamed carrots for color (beautiful to look at and delicious) and is ready to grab n go. You will get excited to try it just by the way it looks. Practically everything looks FRESH and delicious! I haven\'t seen anything here that makes me think, "yuck, I don\'t think I should eat that..." \n\nMost importantly to me, Wicked spoon has a lot of PALEO FRIENDLY FOOD! I got a plate of bacon, kale salad, pork belly, beets, artichoke hearts, and bone marrow! I scooped out the bone marrow , added a dash of salt, then mixed it into my kale salad. DELICIOUS! I would have got some prime rib, but I just don\'t like that cut of meat. The fattier the better, I say! This plate was just the first of a lot of different paleo-ish foods I picked.  Also, there is a fresh/custom omelet bar that will usually have a long line. I\'ll try that next time! The goodness doesn\'t stop at wicked spoon. Trust me, the long line is worth the wait!'

S'BEST BUFFET EVER! \n\nThere are a lot of buffets in Vegas that serve excellent "buffet food." But Wicked Spoon serves good food, period. They have the type of food that you would enjoy at a nice, sit-down restaurant. \n\nWe went for brunch and I opted for the $35 version with bottomless mimosas. We were all drunk by 1pm so that was a plus. \n\nThe great thing about the food at Wicked Spoon is that a lot of options separated into individual serving sizes in cute little containers. The eggs Benedict, short rib pasta, risotto, fried chicken, Korean short ribs, prime rib and pork belly wrapped in bun all tasted really great. There were so many things to try that I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to try everything before I got full. \n\nThe dessert selection was beautiful. But by the time I got to dessert, I was already stuffed.\n\nIt was such a successful meal. We all had a fantastic time. And you should go too.'

S'Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you: Wicked Spoon - THE buffet of buffets.\n\nLet me first begin by stating: I am NOT a fan of the buffet.\n\nWell, I\'m a fan of the IDEA of a buffet- endless food, endless desserts...mmmmmm.\n\nThe problem? Well, take your average buffet - the food is plentiful, but the taste, quality, and presentation echo that of a prison scene from a movie, or from the hallowed past of your elementary school cafeteria days.\n\nWicked Spoon takes those images, chews them up, and spits them out into something modern, very tasty, and quite enjoyable to look at. (How did I equate spitting with enjoyable??)\n\nIf you\'ve ever sat on the couch watching Food Network\'s Iron Chef, Chopped, or any other show on their lineup that uses verbiage like, "bla bla bla compote" "with a reduction sauce" "pared with a something or other" and your mouth just waters...wondering in your limited restaurant experience what any of those foreign terms taste like- then GO TO WICKED SPOON!!! \n\nThey\'ve got all kinds of bla bla bla compote reduced with a something or other sauce pared nicely with a snippet of something that is PRESENTED to you as if YOU were one of those celebrity judges on Iron Chef!!!\n\nI felt like a SUPERSTAH as I repeated MANY trips to the salad, desserts, main courses, and even to the MACARONI area where like many buffets with an omelet area, you can choose to have the chef add whatever ingredients in that you\'d like (several cheese selections, crispy bacon, veggies, onions, sausage...so many choices) and then he cooks it all together right there. Macaroni with Cheddar, Parmesan, and bacon was my personal favorite.\n\nTheir cheesecake was practically divine. \n\nThe only thing to remember is that the portions are super tiny. Very elegant. Very fancy. \n\nThat\'s a good thing though. If you get something you don\'t like (which is virtually impossible at Wicked Spoon), you can mix it around with your fork and it looks like you\'ve eaten most of it. That way you don\'t have to feel like a wasteful pig when the server comes to clear your dirty dishes.\n\nI did think it was very expensive. It cost a little over $200 for me, my wife, and our 5 children (1 was under 3, so he was free). However, we have paid close to that in Vegas for other buffets and not been happy at all with the quality.\n\nOn a side note- I finally got to try bone marrow! Completely nasty. I\'ll never eat it again. BUT, at least I got to try it!!! :-)'

S"I'm not a fan of buffets because I'm a believer of quality over quantity. For being a buffet, Wicked Spoon is actually pretty good. I've never seen a buffet that has roasted bone marrow! Presentation of all their foods is awesome. Nicely individual plated dishes. Dessert bar is amazing. If you're looking for a good buffet, Wicked Spoon ranks up there with the best of them in Las Vegas."

S'All I can say is, wow, wow, wow.  Now, don\'t get me wrong, the Wicked Spoon was not the perfect buffet, but I can tell you this: it was without a doubt the best buffet I have been to in Las Vegas in years, and that is a lot of different buffets.  Just to make sure, we went again the next night because my wife had won a free dinner on the Identity Member wheel and we thought "Well, lets use it because we dont want to lose it in 7 days", plus, it was just that good the first time to go back the next night.\n\nThe choices include typical buffet foods such as prime rib and cold crab legs, but after that the differences range from subtle to what I would consider, broad.  Sublle differences included ricotta creamed spinach (aswesome, silky and flavorful), shrimps sauteed to order in mango butter or a selection of others, and our favorite: roaste bone marrow.  Broad differences included grilled cowboy bacon (pork belly in a  zesty bbq sauce) to deep-fried pig\'s tail.\n\nAll of the food was really, really good and at times bordering on great.  Seasoning was spot on in most cases, What also  makes this unique is the portioning: much of the food comes already in these great little containers that look like littel saute pans or pots.'

S"I don't know what all the hype is about but I'm guessing it was for dinner because Sunday brunch sucked!! Definitely not worth the $35 dollars.  \n\nYay:\n-Desserts: Cheesecake, gelato, rice pudding, carrot cake, and the strawberries (from the chocolate covered strawberries) were all the things I liked from this buffet.\n-You have the option of paying $10 extra for champagne brunch which was nice.  \n\nNay:\n-Food: why is everything so salty?!? I'm surprised no one is tasting the food before it comes out.  After I was done eating, my tongue felt sore from the abrasiveness of all the salty food.\n-Variety: They don't have that many.  There was an abundance of pork though. Bacon, sausage (breakfast sausage and sausage patties, and andouille), roasted pork (Chinese 5 spice-skin was not crispy, Chinese pork ribs, and at the carving station-pork belly bacon was really tough and roasted pork ribs).  They had a small section of Asian food-everything was bleh or too salty, Spanish/Italian foods, a large breakfast station, a breakfast omelette station, a make your own cereal station, salad bar, dessert and the only soup being offered was a miso soup and guess what, yes that's salty as well. \n-Carving station: I guess it's my fault for not asking about what was being served before I waited in line but there was NO prime rib!  I'm just so used to ALL the buffets in Vegas offering it, but this was a huge disappointment.  The only thing they had were roasted chicken, top sirloin, bone marrow and roast pig.  I liked that they had bone marrow BUT the toast that was served with it and the chimichurri was SALTY! UGH! It had like a strong garlic salt taste to it\n-The guy at the carving station: was very inattentive.  Didn't seem like he wanted to be there.  A customer asked for a slice of prime rib and he gave him a slice of top sirloin.  Didn't even try to correct him and say that it wasn't prime rib.  Maybe he didn't hear him, but like I said, very inattentive.  I had to wave him down once because he was staring off somewhere else.\n\nI definitely regret coming here for brunch."

And it was $44 a person. The sushi was so-so, think they might have had more selection earlier in the evening. Desserts were plentiful, with gelato and ice cream, pastries and mousses, and chocolate covered strawberries. Maybe for a cheaper price and more selection, it would be more impressive."

I have probably gone to every buffet on the strip and in old town. For the $$, Wicked Spoon I feel is far superior to all the different buffets on the strip. There's so much to choose from but what puts this place far in front of others is the quality of the food. Virtually everything on the buffet are things you could get at a fine dining restaurant. Especially their dessert section. OMG!  from the crumbled heath bar covered strawberries to the large selection of delicious ice cream and sorbets. I could go on and on.

It was disappointing that they didn't have king crab legs..just snow crab. Everything else served was nothing to rave about. \n\nThey have a good variety of desserts and I definitely recommend trying the Gelato. They have a large variety with some unique flavors. When I went there was a line to get the gelato. Some of the flavors are really good (Chai Tea, Nutella) but others taste off (Mint Chip). The macarons were stale...the filling was hard\n\nWhile dining there was a table nearby that was called to the managers attention. The server paid extra attention to them, often flirting with the group of guys and basically neglected our table. Every single time she came to pick up our plates we had already stacked them for her because she had taken so long that we'd gone multiple rounds around the buffet. \n\nBe aware that there are better buffets on the strip and think about whether or not you want to spend your money here."

S'*4.5 stars out of 5*\n\nThree things Vegas is synonymous with: Gambling, Clubbing, and Buffets.  Cosmopolitan\'s Wicket Spoon is a great example of what a legitimate high-end buffet should be like.  Once you walk through the maze-like route just to find the buffet (though the hotel is beautiful and worth the walk), your eyes fall upon some simple back-lit display of the buffet\'s name.  While a bit pricey if your table is 6 or more (18% gratuity added to each person, thus bringing dinner to $44 after tax/tip), overall I felt Wicked Spoon is worth the price of admission at least once if not a few times.  I wouldn\'t give it 5 stars only because it was missing some of the foods that I personally like. \n\nI\'ve had the share of "nice" and many not-so-nice buffets, and Wicked Spoon would rank in top 3 of my buffets in terms of selection of all types of fine cuisine, tastiness of several dishes that I tried (not everything is great...esp that soba noodle dish, don\'t get it), and their dessert bar is amazingggg.  Another nice touch is that rather than have your server bring glasses of water from a unmarked pitcher of tap water, Wicked Spoon goes the extra mile to provide ornate "bottled" glass pitchers of water at each table that tastes pretty good for water lol Whether this is actually a placebo effect and my mind is easily amused by bottled-glass-water, it\'s the experience that matters! \n\n The waiters/waitresses realllly earn their tips as they are very quick about clearing your table of empty dishes; the dishes they use are high quality, HEAVY ceramic ones too....so I felt bad that ours had to clear our table of 10\'s dishes over and over again.  She get\'s an A for great service, especially at a buffet where her focus wasn\'t just our table but the 6+ tables around us.\n\nFood-wise, Wicket Spoon has the typical potpourri of carvery meats, seafood options, asian-themed foods (i really can\'t recommend asian foods @ non-asian restaurants, it never tastes "right"), and then of course a sumptuous dessert bar.  The presentation of many of their dishes exhibits extra flair compared to all other buffets; rather than typical presentations on smaller dishes or even just "get your own" from within a larger bowl, Wicked Spoon serves their entrees on small, metal pot-like devices.  It\'s not very space efficient on your plate, but it allows each serving to taste more consistent and most likely better than if you were to grab your own serving size from a larger mass.  \n\nPlease save room for dessert as their gelato bar is as good as any other gelato bar that you have to normally pay-per-scoop! The have 18 flavors and I could only cram 6 different varieties into my stomach before I felt like exploding.  In addition, there\'s an assortment of "Godiva-like" creations such as dark chocolate + crunch dipped strawberrys, Godiva-cakes on-a-stick, cheesecakes, and many other pastries that looked delectable but not physically affordable in my stomach :(   \n\nAnother thing, I was hungover while eating @ Wicked Spoon and it still tasted good and I was still able to eat a good amount!  That means if once prepares for the "experience" of a buffet (i.e. starving themselves beforehand), this could be potentially a fantastic gluttonous experience!!'

Roast sirloin, Bahn mi (pork sandwich), Korean squid salad, bacon mashed potatoes, and green beans were our favorites.  I would have liked a bit more variety of fruit (saw only pineapple and grapes) considering this is a brunch.

For example, Bacchanal had fried rice which looked so bad that I didn't even try it.  The fried rice at Wicked Spoon was delicious.   Ditto for the green tea I ordered.  Bacchanal serves bigelow tea bags (the cheapest teas you can buy) but the Wicked Spoon served high end green tea that you would find at Whole Foods.  \n\nNone of the food stations had long lines.  I would eat here again!"

S"Sometimes I have dreams about eating at the Wicked Spoon and can't help but claim that this is truly the best buffet that I have ever been to.  There is some pretty stiff competition when it comes to buffet dinning in Vegas, but this place hands down takes the cake!  Love having various food stations offering petite portions of delicacies from around the world.  Presentation of each dish was splendid.  Specialty items are served in specific vessels to give you that high class dinning experience with out the pretentiousness.  The quality of the food is everything you could ask for and beyond.  The attention to detail from the taste, temperature, presentation, and service was spot on, which is why this five star rating should be honored.  Who knows... I might just end up taking a quick round trip flight straight back to the Wicked Spoon if the cravings start to reach a certain level of intensity:)"

For the quality of the food at this place, it's totally worth the $35. The Wynn itself is $40 for dinner and it doesn't even top this place. \n\nI've tried both their lunch and dinner and to me, I liked the dinner more because I enjoyed the dinner choices more. \n\nThe dessert area at this place is SO YUM. They even have gelato with different weird flavors! The PB&J gelato was so yummy and tasted like a real PB&J!! \n\nCome early or expect to wait around 1-1.5 hrs. But totally worth the wait."

I really enjoyed the Ebi Shrimp and the Cheese and meats selection. Everything on the buffet was fresh and they kept it clean. The service here was also very good about drink refills and taking away dirty plates. My one complaint was they jacked up the prices during the Christmas holiday.

S'This buffet is a total FRAUD! Regular people would not know what I\'m about to tell you. So I\'m not one to eat buffet because, I just don\'t it is worth it. I can\'t eat that much anyways. I rather go to a nice restaurant. Since my friends were telling me how good it is, and how the food it served portioned in tiny pots and plates, I decided to try it. I went on a Staurday afternoon, therefore it was brunch. Cost was $30pp, $39pp with champagne/mimosa. That day had quite a selection of pastas. I had the gnochhi which came with about 7 pieces and it was soooo SALTY. There also was the duck confit ravioli which came with 2 pieces, which was pretty good. I also had the mac and cheese which was also pretty good. Even though they were nicely portioned and no one is digging into the food, I find the portioned to be too large. I would have liked it if there were only 3 pieces of gnochhi and 1 piece of ravioli. The braised beef with polenta was yummy but there was waaaaay too much butter in the polenta. There were some sushi as well, but didn\'t bother to get since the fish were sliced newspaper thin. The salad salad section was decent. The selection of cheeses were great. However, they did not have prime rib, instead they have sirloin. I also got the bone marrow which was next to the sirloin. The SHOCK came when I headed to the dessert section. Some of the desserts were placed on a stand. The legs of the stand had "La Rose Noire" printed on it. Like I said most people would not know what that is, BUT I DO!. La Rose Noire is a Hong Kong based company that has a factory in China that manufactures desserts for restaurants. WTF! Wicked Spoon doesn\'t make their own desserts. There is NO PASTRY CHEF?!?!?! After seeing that brand I start to see things clearer! I bet the gelato is not freshly made with fresh fruits and nuts. I bet they use a mix and just add water. The pistachio flavor was looking a bit too green. Pistachio flavor of real gelato should be khaki color because fresh nuts are used.'

S"My boyfriend and I went here for brunch early on Sunday before heading to the airport. We were seated quickly and were told our server would be with us right away. The man who seemed to be in charge of our section (serving every other table around us) did not stop to ask if we wanted drinks, didn't even look at us. Half way through our second plate a lady came by and asked how we were doing. I told her no one took our drink order, so she cleared our first plates and brought us drinks. I'm glad she was able to help us but was confused because she appeared to be a busser and wasn't serving any other tables. I couldn't understand why the other server was completely ignoring us while taking everyone else's drink order as soon as they were seated. Honestly, my boyfriend and I were the only non-caucasians in the section during our meal. It bothers me to say this but I'm convinced that's the reason why we weren't being served by this particular person. Totally ruined the last part of our trip for us... Wouldn't return nor would I recommend to family or friends for this reason.\n\nAs for the food... it wasn't bad but I wasn't blown away either. The angry mac & cheese, pork belly buns were tasty but a little on the cold side. There wasn't a very big selection and I was expecting more from the desserts based on other reviews.

This is one the pricier buffets on the strip, and it's definitely worth trying.  Their coffee torte is the best dessert I've had.  I would not choose Wicked Spoon over Bachanal.

S'Wynn Buffet vs. Wicked Spoon\n\nSince these 2 buffets seem to be the top contenders for best buffet in Vegas I felt it would be beneficial to potential customers to structure this review as a comparison.  I visited Wynn and Wicked Spoon on 2 separate occasions for their weekend brunch.  \n\n\nPRICE: Wicked Spoon\n\nThe Wicked Spoon is slightly less expensive for all meals, but your savings will amount to about $3 per person.  \n\n\nAMBIANCE and PRESENTATION:  Wynn Buffet\n\nI\'m not sure what the theme of Wicked Spoon is.  It has metallic ornaments hanging from the ceiling and I\'m not sure what they\'re supposed to be or represent or how it compliments the name of "Wicked Spoon".  The rest of the dining area is kind of dark and woodsy.  Overall, the ambiance  is kind of random and haphazard, just like the rest of The Cosmopolitan.  \n\nThe Wynn Buffet doesn\'t have a catchy name, but the environment is gorgeous.  From the ceilings you will see beautiful hanging plants decorated with different fake vegetables and fruits.  It\'s visually appealing and at the very least consistent with the theme of gluttonously devouring endless plates of food, which is what a buffet is all about.  \n\nAnother annoying feature at the Wicked Buffet was the use of mini skillets and cups containing smaller portions of food.  While I like this approach as a means of controlling the size of my portions, it gets annoying placing these items in my plate with other items.  I have no idea how many people have touched those containers and I certainly don\'t want them touching my other foods.  Additionally, those containers are bulky and take a lot of space on my plate.  \n\n\nFOOD VARIETY:  Wynn Buffet\n\nSALAD BAR/ PRE-MEAL ITEMS: Wynn\n\nBoth Wynn and Wicked Spoon lack decent salad bars, which is a huge disappointment for me because I like starting my gorging with a quality salad; at least Wynn offered some options for creating a decent salad though, whereas Wicked Spoon offered 2 choices of premade salads in small bowls.  These salads were tasteless and failed to impress me.  The appetizer/ hor\'derve/ pre-meal area consisted mostly of different types of breads, small cups of shrimp cocktails (2 small shrimps per cup).  Additionally, I didn\'t notice any hot soups at Wicked Spoon.  \n\nCUSTOMIZED FOOD STATIONS: Wynn\n\nAnother huge disappointment at the Wicked Spoon was the lack of stations where you could have foods freshly made.  At the Wynn Buffet there was an Italian station where you could have a pasta cooked in front of you with your favorite ingredients by a chef.  The Wynn also had an omelet station, crepe station, and panang station where you could also make the aforementioned items cooked to your specifications.   The only station at the Wicked Spoon was for omelets.  \n\n\nMEAT STATION:  Wicked Spoon\n\nThe Wicked Spoon actually offers more meat at the meat station than the Wynn Buffet\'s meat station.  Wicked Spoon offered large cuts of bacon, ham, sausage, lamb, and prime rib.  At Wynn Buffet, there were only 2 fresh meat items offered at the time of my visit.  \n\n\nDESSERT STATION:  Wynn\n\nBoth Wynn and Wicked Spoon offer a diverse and tasty variety of desserts and the only real advantage that Wynn has over Wicked Spoon is a crepe station.  There\'s plenty of dessert pics so you can see for yourself what Wicked Spoon has to offer.  I recommend the cheesecake.  The cookies were rock hard and inedible.  The gelato was mediocre.  \n\n\nother notable observations at Wicked Spoon: \n\n1.  Breakfast station combined with Mexican station!!? The breakfast station offered pancakes and french toast and then as I walked a half foot further I saw tacos and Mexican dishes.  In between the breakfast and Mexican station was a section for toppings for both pancakes and tacos.  As I mentioned before, Wicked Spoon was way too haphazard in its presentation and organization.  \n\n2.  Italian Station - do people actually like eating shitty cardboard pizza?  Why would you pay $30 and pile your plate with that garbage?  I didn\'t even bother with the Italian station at Wicked Spoon.  \n\n3.  Asian Station - Wicked Spoon had some more meats here (Korean BBQ and some turkey thing covered in teriyaki sauce), which is a plus, but not enough to beat the Asian station at Wynn, which had a Panang Station, where a chef actually made panang in front of me tailor made to my specifications.  The Asian station also had crappy sushi that I didn\'t touch  and some Vietnamese Bahn Mi sandwiches, which I wasn\'t interested in because it was pork based.  The Asian station also had the only soup; that\'s right, the only soup the Wicked Spoon had was Miso!\n\nSERVICE:  Wynn\nMy server was a bit slow.  I observed another party being immediately greeted by their server as soon as they sat down.  I didn\'t see my server until a good 5 minutes after I sat.  \n\n\nCONCLUSION: \nThe Wicked Spoon is all hype.  I attribute the high reviews to a large number of female reviewers who enjoy trendy new things and tasty desserts'

S'Tried it for the first time on 7/17/11 and it will be my last time eating there.  I had such a horrible experience.  Our waitress got our drinks and took off for lunch and didnt let us know.  We had stacks of empty plates sitting on our table for a good amount of time.  Then we had to flag another waiter and asked about our waitress.  He goes oh, she is on lunch.  I will be covering for you.  Still with him covering, he didnt come by as much to pick up the plates or get us refills on drinks.  First plate i got was the fried chicken....boy was that a bad idea!  Took a couple bits then noticed it was PINK!  My other friend got some too and it was the same.  I told someone that worked there and she was like yeh...i never eat chicken here.  I was quite amazed on her comment.  The crappy part was that i got sick and had to miss a day of work cause i got sick and was yacking my brains out the following night.  Everything seems to be extremely salty as well.  I rather use my money and get Burger King or something.'

S"I didn't get the hype.  Maybe we were there on an off weekend but there wasn't some hour long wait at 11am nor was the food mind-blowing impressive for a buffet.  I kept hearing amazing things about how Wicked Spoon is up there with Bellagio.  I do admit, the Bloody Mary bar was quite impressive with all the various types of picked veggies.  They also have red velvet pancakes!  However, the food itself failed to be up to par with the better gourmet buffets of Vegas.  I wish we went to the Wynn or Bellagio instead.  Orange juice tasted concentrated mehhh.  \n\nThe best thing I ate though - the prime rib.  A perfect medium rare and very flavorful.  All the little clad iron pots they serve everything in are adorable and a cute concept but cute doesn't mean tasty.  I did want to grab every pot I saw but when I tasted the food, it just wasn't that impressive.  I think I'll just stick w/ the Wynn or Bellagio next time."

S"I love going to buffets, but every time I go to one, I always get disappointed.  However, not at Wicked Spoon.  \n\nThere is a reason why Wicked Spoon is being touted as the newest BEST buffet in Vegas.  At $35/person (Between Sunday to Thursday, I THINK it's $45 on Fri-Sat), the variety and quality of the food here is really amazing.  \n\nI love the portion and presentation of each item.  Some highlights include the crab legs, asian style pork ribs, carnitas, angry mac and cheese, and their gelato ice cream (PB&J flavor = amazing!!).  \n\nThey have a great selection of food and my server, Cathy, was very nice and the overall decor of the buffet is modern and sophisticated, not at all crappy and cheap looking like a lot of buffets.\n\nNote: We arrived at 4:40p, the buffet opens at 5, and there was already a line on a Monday night!  If you arrive at 5, you're guarantee a long line - but since we arrived a bit early, the wait was not a problem at all."

Wicked Spoon... so amazing sounding... must be so amazing with the way everyone marvels about the presentation and the styles of food available. Wicked Spoon was at the top of my list and while I enjoyed the route from one end to the other (my friend did not have the same amused appreciation), there was not much else worthy to claim 5 stars about. \n\nI think I paid something around $40-45 for a weekend meal. It was so expensive and the little eats that were supposed to be so fantastically orgasmic were average, at best.  I can't really think of anything that really stood out to what I would come back specifically for. \n\nI'm trying really hard to sum up some nice thoughts about this place but besides the decor, there wasn't anything really awesome... \n\nAnd I really had to use the bathroom after I ate... my belly did not feel right or well."

S'Hands down the best buffet in Las Vegas. It wouldn\'t be a stretch to consider this place one of the best overall restaurants in Las Vegas either. You see, this place isn\'t your traditional Vegas value buffet (think Griswold\'s Vegas Vacation). No, these guys serve quality dishes with superior ingredients. The dishes look attractive too. I loved the southern fried chicken served in a mini fry basket. The various Chinese dishes served mini Chinese take-out boxes were cool too. The Korean short ribs and the shrimp and grits are both must tries. You can\'t get bone marrow at your local Golden Corral ether. Again, get the traditional "buffet" picture out of your head! This is high quality stuff served to satisfy your appetite and then some. Be sure to hit up the dessert bar afterwards. The chocolate covered strawberries and french macarons were very rich and flavorful!\n\nHighlights:\nBeef short ribs\nCrab legs \nShrimp and grits\nSouthern fried chicken\nPrime rib\nDessert bar!'

S"I came here for dinner with a huge group of people (20+) and we ended up spending $50/person including Tax and gratuity. There were a lot of options and the food was gourmet but I definitely didn't eat $50 worth of food. I especially didn't like the crab legs were cut in half down the length of the legs. I also didn't like that most of their gourmet items were in their own little dishes and pots - look up way too much space on my plate and I had to get up multiple times to get the rest of the buffet. Because of all these obstacles that were in place, you got full quickly and couldn't eat your money's worth. I also didn't like that they left bottles of wine at our table, making us believe they were free, when they were only advertising the wine for us to purchase. \n\nOn a positive note, the desert bar was amazing! They had a gelato station and the Thai Tea flavor tasted EXACTLY like the actual tea itself. It was awesome. There were a lot of delicate mini chocolate deserts. DELICIOUS! I had to make several trips to the desert bar because it was so good."

S'I picked 1 buffet for my visit to Las Vegas. I looked through yelp pictures and reviews and chose the wicked spoon for Sunday brunch. I was so disappointed with the food and service.\nWe came early so we would not have to wait. We paid and waited in line then told to wait in a different line, that was for platinum card members. Then another lady came over a told people to wait in the line we were waiting in, so here 30 people stood in front of us, because it was so disorganized.\n\nThe food was subpar at best. \n $65 for 2 was not worth it at all. All you can drink champagne, Bloody Mary, or mimosas. If you can only find your server. \n\nI did like the french toast and my husband like the asian spare ribs and duck ravioli. I must say that my biggest disappointment was in the flavorless desserts. When you look at the pictures your mouth waters.  They do look like they would be delicious. \nI get the small containers of food for portion control, however with the taste of  the food lthat was all the control you need. Not too many second round winners.I tasted enough, but felt sick later. MSG always does that to me. I should have listened to a suggestion to try the Buffet at Caesars instead. Next time I will. Was not worth the price.'

By personalized I mean... Most buffets have a tray of fried chicken but this one has them in little fryer buckets. \n\n My favorite thing I had was probably duck with pesto, the strawberries, and this curried rice with cauliflower mash. \n\nI went for brunch this time and even tho it's cheaper.. Dinner is by far the better choice"

S'This place just opened 2 weeks ago?! My, oh my.\n\nThe buffet, my first meal in Vegas this time, was certainly welcoming and accommodating. For the last 3 weeks to a month, this Cosmopolitan commercial with an old cougar dancing with a youngster and puppies kept popping up on my tv screen and made me more and more curious. \n\nThis place is NOT easy to find at all. If it weren\'t for a friend, I would\'ve never found this place; it\'s like a hidden gem.\n\nThe decor is beautiful. Swirly chandeliers and cups, and they even a fancy-looking glass bottle of sparkling water, supposedly "clear and crisp". It tastes like my Poland Spring.\n\nThe food is really good, but they do need some changes. \nThe lobster, for example, is really sandy. I couldn\'t tell if i was eating crumbled shells or maybe even sand. The sushi bar has the typical sushi rolls like california, tuna, roe, etc. They should make some more special rolls and a la carte ones.\n\nI LOVED the italian section, though, especially the flat pizza. The mashed potatoes, mmhmm! Too much butter and very fatening, but doesn\'t beat Outback\'s. Also, I suggest getting the shrimp cups with cocktail sauce. Super fresh.\n\nOn to the dessert...oh my god, truly amazing - chocolate covered strawberries?! Hell to the yes! Where can you really find these in a buffet, seriously?! I just hate the fact that they were covered in nuts and balls... I mean, crunch balls. I DON\'T recommend getting the chocolate covered apple. The apple is tasteless and sandy. Also, the neon colored-looking mango cup was delicious! If they had a chocolate fondue, that would be an extra plus. Dinner was only $27 so it\'s not so bad, considering the variety of food.'

S'Not as good as before but still solid.  Go for the meat and dessert.  \nThe wait times are decent and the staff attentive and efficoent.  Meat is the star.  Prime rib, roast pig, N.Y. steak and bone marrow all good.  The crab was tasteless.  Many of the dished seemed overcooked, especially the shellfish.  Sushi bar was forgettable with 3 options and 2 being california rolls.  Decor and ambiance is decent if basic.  Dessert had many options with some very creative ideas and most of them tasty.  I like the macaroons and gelato bar.'

S"Yelp, this is the first time you have failed me. I came here for dinner on a Friday night and I was so appalled to find out that they DID NOT MAKE ANY MACAROONS!!!!! The food was meh and the selection was a double meh. I gave this place 2 stars because they did have a stellar gelato selection, the decor was really nice, and the waitress was also wonderful. Other than that if you want to try this place and waste your moola then be my guest. I would rather eat at buffet over at the M hotel.\n\nI may have been here on an off night but this is Vegas! I believe for the price I pay I should not be concerned about whether or not there is any inconsistency with my food. Not just that there are so many other options that I would think the quality should be kept at a higher level. Oh and those who are reeled in by the bone marrow offerings don't get suckered in like we did. It's not anything special. Bland at most and the only thing that gave it flavor was the horse radish sauce and chutney.  \n\nI also want to include one more thing, this is more of an annoyance. This is a buffet.....not a ball gown and tie restaurant........snooty attitudes are tacky. Yes, girl behind me at the seafood station behind I am talking to you. Don't roll your eyes at other guests because they can't make a decision as to whether or not they want mussels, clams, or shrimp. If people are given options they will take their time to decide! Sheesh! It was also nice that you tipped him for making your clams and shrimps but a dollar won't make you less snobby."

S'I have never wanted to try a Las Vegas buffet as much as I wanted to go to Wicked Spoon.  The concept of individualized containers and high-end items really appealed to me. After a couple of failed attempts and massively long lines, I got my chance.  \n\nThe individualized containers were all that I could have ever hoped for.  Little ramekins, bowls, and cups of pasta, meats, and salads were so cute and portioned for grazing.  Those containers also made handling a plate really difficult since you could never put more than 2-3 containers on a plate at any one time. \n\nA major disappointment was how quickly Wicked Spoon ran out of "the good stuff."  Someone walking out of the buffet at the end of his lunch warned me that they had run out of both salmon and bone marrow.  When I returned for the first seating of dinner, they were still out of bone marrow.  I managed to try the salmon and beluga lentil dish, which was delicious.  They one measly plate of macarons which I later discovered they had no intent of refilling.  They udon noodle bar never seemed to have any noodles.  \n\nI enjoyed the prime rib, fried oysters, gelato bar, marshallows, kale salad, and variety.  It was very heavy in carbs - lots and lots of pizzas and filling pastas as per buffet usual but they were well-done too.  \n\nMy major gripe was that it didn\'t seem luxurious or interesting enough.  No bone-marrow, sweetbreads, lamb chops, macarons, rilletes, pork belly, xiao lung bao, all of which I saw in other yelp photos.  One of the more unique items on our visit was the calves liver and onions.  Just because it\'s offal doesn\'t make liver and onions a desirable dish! \n\nIt\'s still up there as an interesting and delicious buffet but at $42 dinner and $37 lunch plus the long lines...just know what you\'re getting yourself into.'

S'I was so excited to try this place because of all the press and photos I\'d seen. Sadly, I ended up being a tad underwhelmed. \n\nI love the individual servings as opposed to big messy trays where people duel to the death for certain items or use whatever tongs they can get a hold of. However, there just wasn\'t enough variety to make everyone happy.\n\nMeat lovers have tons of enticing options, such as duck ravioli, bone marrow, and braised boar ragout. Seafood lovers have less to choose from. The menu was very shrimp-heavy-shrimp cocktail, shrimp ceviche, Spanish-style garlic shrimp...\n\nMaybe this is the Asian lady in me, but I was wondering the whole time, "Where are the clams? Mussels? Calamari? Fish?" There were one or two fish dishes, which were rather cookie cutter and nothing exciting. Crab legs were offered, so you might be happy if that\'s your thing. I never cared much for crab legs, so I was left wanting more.\n\nVegetarians are even less well-represented, unless you count the salad bar. And vegans? Forget about it.\n\nThis all-you-can-eat is pretty awesome for people who have a sweet tooth; I\'ll give it that. Desserts range from macarons to strawberry cream puffs to a dense chocolate cake. For me, the desserts were the highlight of my dining experience here.\n\nWe came at dinnertime, supposedly when buffets put out the best of the best. And we were in Vegas, known to be a buffet heaven. Despite all that, I failed to be impressed by this newer restaurant. The Wicked Spoon, though it serves some decent (not great) meat dishes with decadent ingredients, didn\'t meet my definition of a great buffet.'

S"After reading reviews on here, I decided to dine at WS for my Birthday dinner.  I was so excited because I saw that they served Bone marrow, which I have never heard of a buffet serving.  I figured I had to pace myself, so I grab a plate of the crab legs, which was nice because they are already split and ready to eat!  After finishing my warm-up plate, I was going to get my second plate.  As I was turning to show my bf what I got, some random stranger walked by and wanted to share what he had eaten by projecting vomit all over my right side! I was like WTF? Did this just happened to me? On my Birthday? Just shocked and stun, I was so embarrassed because everyone who was sitting there saw what happen. I quickly went to the bathroom to clean myself off and trying not to vomit myself. I was picking chunks of pasta noodles and meat off my shirt and hair.  I was mortified and humiliated and just wanted to get to a shower and get the strangers vomit off me. I proceeded to the front and ask for the manager to get a refund, because at this point I was done arguing with the guy who assaulted me with vomit. I informed the manager of what happened and he gave me a refund. Did they do anything to compensate for this? Nope! I felt that they did nothing to make the situation better but only gave me a refund. The customer service was handled very poorly and have left a very bad first impression on me.  I am traumatized and am very skeptical about going to buffets now, especially in Vegas.  Being assaulted with a strangers vomit isn't exactly the birthday dinner I had imagined.  I wish I could rate on the food but since I didn't get the chance to enjoy it but as far as the customer service; I felt that it could of been handled better. So don't expect bend over backwards service."

Was it the endless choices of delicious foods? Definitely!\n\nSome of the highlights (besides the unlimited mimosas) included this tiny amuse de bouche size of watermelon, balsamic glaze and creme fraiche - I had three of these! House cured bacon - yes, please! Try the tasty meatballs and wicked wings and of course, the Asian fare which included kalbi, shrimp congee. I think the other buffet did the Asian better. Oh they have about 20 types of delicious gelato and some great desserts. Our server was sweet and never had empty plates or glasses on our table for long.\n\nSome misses were the carving station guy who looked super bored and plopped the extra large helpings of ham, sausage onto my dish, the extra hard teeth-chipping egg Benedict. Their kalbi was a bit too sweet and way to chewy. Some of their foods were just plain cold which is a shame.\n\nI thought the food here was more nuanced and vegetable choices had more variety. it wasn't just salad bar of veggies.

For example, the lamb meatballs were served in a tiny pot that you could bring back to your table! They had something from each type of cuisine, but what I remember having was korean short ribs, sushi, compressed melon salad, prime rib, crab legs and much more. \n\nThe dessert area was so pretty; our group ended up taking pictures of it! They had chocolate covered strawberries, gelato, and various types of tarts, fudge, etc.\n\nDinner is reasonably priced at $35. This is definitely a place to try at least once!'

The only thing I was not a fan of was the Asian food.  The har gow was obviously old and have been sitting as the skin on the har gow as hard as a rock.

S"We ate there tonight after reading all the yelp reviews.  We were trying to find something better and different than our regular Bellagio.  I was a bit disappointed because most of the items written about and pictured here were not offered. I'm not sure if a limited menu was offered because it was a weeknight.  Weeknight and weekend night prices are the same ($35) so the menus should be comparable.  I was really looking forward to some items other yelp reviewers enjoyed.  Some of the items I noticed were missing from the buffet included: pad thai, sesame chicken, mussels, pork buns (although the guy told me it was a morning menu item), tacos al pastor, macarons (i don't care for them but i know many people love them and they were missing from the buffet), the little painted egg shell dessert cups, fried chicken, sweet potato fries, mac 'n cheese bar, chicken apple sausage, kalbi, head on shrimp (really wanted this one), and many others.  In fact, I didn't think there was anything on the menu worth the $35. The best items were the corn on the cob with cilantro butter and the watermelon w/feta.  I still feel the Bellagio buffet with the Chilean sea bass is a better deal. Plus Bellagio serves several more expensive buffet items and provides a nicer variety.  \n\nI was also pretty annoyed by all the individual dishes and pans.  The pans were bulky and heavy to carry.  At a buffet, I often like to take just a spoonful of a dish to try before fully committing.  Many of the dishes were too much of a commitment.  I wanted to try the pappardelle but I didn't want to take a whole pot of it.  The tables were also too small for so many dishes.  To give the staff credit, they did a great job clearing the tables.   While trying to juggle and arrange everything on the table, I dropped my fork and our server came right over to replace it.  The bottle of water at the table was nice but it was poured into a tiny glass with no ice.  It's August in Vegas and I wanted cold water.  After refusing the bottle of wine, I was surprise the bottle was left on the tiny table, taking up precious table real estate.  \n\nWe wanted to try something new this time around.  We usually eat at an on strip buffet at least once while we visit Vegas because it's not a trip to Vegas without a Vegas buffet.  Our other meals are usually is off the strip. We initially wanted to try the Wynn buffet because we've never tried it but went with Wicked Spoon instead.  I've eaten at Studio B, Spices, Lago, Carnival, Village Seafood, Le Village, and Bellagio.  It seems like I eat at Bellagio at least once every time I'm in Vegas.  (I just ate there two weeks ago when I was last here).  We don't always eat at buffets.  I had a great meal at Social House in the Crystals shopping center and had a great hot dog at Pink's during my last visit but buffets always seems to be the easiest meal option when you're with a larger group or with a picky eater.  I don't eat nearly enough to make buffets worth the price. But I do try to make up for it by eating the more expensive items like seafood or duck.  \n\nThe buffet it not terrible but not great."

S"I'm not sure why everyone raves about this buffet but it was not good imo.  I came here Thanksgiving weekend and tried mostly everything.  The meat station is a joke and so is the dessert bar.  The chocolate dipped strawberries were not even sweet!  The only good thing from dessert was the grapefruit sorbet.    Food is very underwhelming.  \n\nService is very good.  Our server was attentive and picked up dishes and refilled drinks."

S'In quite a few trips to Las Vegas through the years, I\'ve learned a few things about this town.\n- Vegas is stacked to the brim with weirdos.  People with some serious issues that need dealing with.\n- Urban sprawl is quite ugly, especially when urban development is ignored for the sake of expanding suburbia.\n- Buffets would lead me to be one of those poor overweight souls who cruise around casinos and streets of El Eh Es Vegas at high speeds on my very own Rascal scooter.\n\nI\'ve had my share of buffets in Sin City.  Some good, many bad, but all with certain expectations.\n\nLet\'s just say that Wicked Spoon destroyed all of them- buffets and expectations.\n\nConsidering I came here the morning after over-indulging at another buffet (which at that point had already shattered any notion of me having "very good" buffet food in Vegas before that moment) and had the brunch buffet, I\'m thoroughly impressed by the quality and variety on offer here.  Especially considering the great price point.\n\nI\'m not about to go down the list of everything I ate.  I\'m limited in the number of characters I can use in a review anyway.\n\nWhat I can tell you is that the food was incredibly fresh and tasty, the place was very busy (ensuring good turnover on food items), the variety on offer was pleasing and drew me in all directions all meal long, and the service was very friendly and attentive (Samira from Morocco is a sweetie!).\n\nTo top it off, there were items there that were done in a way that was much more like an a la carte service than a normal buffet.  Someone put a ton of planning into building this style and executing it this well.  I\'d like to thank that someone by standing in front of them, shaking their hand, and shedding a tear of joy for them to see just how happy they made me.\n\nA really impressive dining experience, buffet-labeled or not.'

S'Las Vegas buffets are pretty dime a dozen these days.  Now with all the different ones and with the "Buffet of Buffets", 24 hours for $44.99, buffets are doing more and more to stand out.  WIcked Spoon in the Cosmopolitan keeps up with the theme of the hotel, a little naughty but in a good way.\n\nWe went for "brunch" on a Friday, which was $22 for the meal with a complimentary mimosa or bloody mary.  We were seated promptly, another first for a popular Las Vegas buffet that I\'ve been to, the line to get in wasn\'t bad in the first place.  Oranges and red are prevalent in the theme of the restaurant.\n\nThe buffet is plentiful and the variety is great.  The food is across the different cuisines around the world.  Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, American, anything you want in a high end Vegas buffet, you can get.  Because it was "brunch" there were a lot more breakfast foods, the omlette bar and the usual breads and eggs but the "lunch" stuff was still good.  The tri-tip and the bacon at the carving station were highlights for me.  That and the deserts of course but the desert selection didn\'t seem to match the Wynn buffet which I believe was much better for deserts but also 2x the price of admission.\n\n-1 star for sometimes cold food, I know its a buffet but if it\'s been sitting out for awhile, why not throw it out?  Just because it\'s a buffet, doesn\'t mean cold food is acceptable\n-1 star for ok quality food but not amazing, I might\'ve also overhyped the place due to the reviews I\'ve read and my friends reviews,\n\nOverall, its still just a buffet.  But rather than spend these prices, why not go to the higher end restaurants around Vegas?  Pay just a little more money for fine dining, great service and greater flavors in smaller portions.  Of course, if you want to pig out, this buffet isn\'t a bad choice.'

S'My new favorite buffet in Vegas!  Here\'s the thing, I\'ve kind of burned myself out on buffets, especially after once doing all of the buffets on the Buffet of Buffets in 24 hours once, but my tried and true, hands down best has been The M... until now.  Don\'t get me wrong, I still think The M is awesome, but Wicked Spoon upped the ante.\n\nI\'d heard the lines can be crazy so I made my husband check in on Foursquare for three days in a row at Cosmopolitan hot spots so that he would have the badge that gets you VIP line access.  No worries there, since we went early... they open at 5pm and we were there at, um, 5:10, there was NO line.  I was surprised since it was Labor Day, but yea for us!  No wait to pay, no wait to be seated and quick access to the AMAZING food.\n\nI was a little exhausted after the five mile hike to back of the Cosmo property to FIND Wicked Spoon, but luckily sustenance was mine.  What impressed me the most was that the food was presented beautifully AND it was very good.  A lot of times buffet food is just cafeteria food, but I did not get that at all from this one.  \n\nI liked that they had your staples, prime rib, pork roast, etc at the carving station and crab legs and asian fare, BUT that they also had unusual items as well, like the General Tso pigs feet and I\'m still kicking myself for getting too full before I tried the roasted marrow!  The selection is just a huge wow.  But, I noticed some things would run out quickly and I\'d miss out... I never got to try the roasted beet salad, which is a favorite of mine.  \n\nMy favorite items were the prime rib (because that is always a fave for me), the build your own mac and cheese bar, the individual cheese plates (LOVE!), and this one strange little chocolate shot dessert thing that I can\'t describe for the life of me except to say, YUM.  I really enjoyed the "salad/appetizer" section because they had so many little interesting crostinis, cheeses, salads, etc.  I could graze there all night... oh wait, I did.  Oddly, my husband LOVED the dessert bar.  He seriously had three helping and this man does NOT have a sweet tooth.  STRANGE!\n\nI feel like I missed out on a lot because I just get full too fast!  What I didn\'t care for was the chocolate lava cake - um, no lava, and the gnocchi I had was okay, but too soft for my taste.  Surprisingly, the angry mac and cheese did not wow me.  The flavor was good, but the one I got was super dry.  Darn it.\n\nThe staff was all very friendly and attentive.  It was $41 per person on Labor Day evening 2012.  I think that is pricey, but we all felt it was an acceptable price to pay to splurge for a buffet of this caliber. I\'m guessing we\'ll be back.\n\nWHAT CAN THEY DO TO GET FIVE STARS?\n~the food, which I loved, was a little inconsistent - not everything was cooked correctly and that dropped them a half star.\n~removal of used dishes more quickly would be a plus.  We found it odd that they would come by and remove plates, but never took our glasses away when a new one was brought so we had quite a collection of glasses - another minus half star.'

Although it was a little pricey, it was well worth it! The fried oysters were amazing. They had a prime rib station that was pretty good and best of all they had leg of lamb... yum!!

S'The short version - skip the dinner and just get dessert.  Trust me.\n\nThe long version:\nWe were super excited to try a new buffet in Vegas. Although we love the Wynn, we figured we should branch out with our most recent visit. The reviews on Yelp were all glowing, and the pictures were drool-inducing.\n\nBut maybe we should have headed the signs the gods were sending us not to go.  We got lost not once, but twice on our way there as no one in that complex seems able to give good directions and it is way out of the way in the bowels of the beast.  Seriously, there is no way you would be able to find it without directions. The signage was crap.\n\nOn to the food though.  By the time we finally arrived we were starving and ready to go. As per usual buffet routine, we each grabbed a tiny bit of everything during the first round (or as many bits as would fit on our plates). Here we encountered problem  #1.  Predetermined portions (unless small) should never be used in Buffets. particularly when they plate dishes on too big of plates and one can only grab one or two items on a trip.  For example, there were like three varieties of mac and cheese, none of which were good, yet we had to take three sizable ramekins to find this out. I hate throwing food out.\n\nProblem #2. Yes, fusion is fun, but not every dish needs to be a "wow, i never thought those two things would go together!"  Sometimes the classics are ok. Really. Dishes that fell into this category were so un-memorable I\'ve forgotten them already, but trust me, there were quite a few.\n\nProblem #3. Sushi. I agree, sushi really should not be a sushi dish.  But if you are going to serve it, and you are in vegas, home of the sushi buffet for some reason, you need to keep it fresh. Blegh.\n\nAnd now on to the good things...\nAwesomeness #1 Marrow.  I know people have commented it on it many atime, but crap, it\'s so good.\n\nAwesomeness #2 the dessert bar.  Oh my lord. Seriously. Next time it will be straight to this section. The sheer variety was awesome, but of all the pieces we tried, there was not one bad or even mediocre one.  The Lady Godiva Chocolate Lolis.....just think of super moist brownies with an amazing chocolate shell. And cheesecake with just enough lemon zest....dare I say it, better than homemade. And the homemade marshmallows will change your whole perspective on things.\nI could go on and on, and am very tempted to, but that would just be cruel.\n\nAwesomeness #3 Best wait staff in a buffet. Glasses always full, plates always cleared and nice to boot.\n\nOverall, -2 stars for the main dinner, but the dessert alone is worth it.  We\'ll just make sure to hit the Wynn buffet earlier in the day.'

S"We had never actually been to Wicked Spoon: The Buffet.  When Cosmo first opened they offered several ongoing events to showcase the culinary and liquid refreshment talents of some of their offerings.  The (now defunct) wine store had a bi-weekly wine and food pairing seminar, complete with generous tastings of both.  Wicked Spoon set up elaborate themed buffets in one of their private rooms, with spectacular tastings and open bar, and we went to it regularly until, like all good thing, it ended.  Oh, how I miss those glory days!!\n\nBut on the LAX to LAS leg of our recent trip back from Australia we were each handed a playing card-type box containing Cosmopolitan promo cards, and one was a BOGO for Wicked Spoon.  We took advantage of that one, expecting that the food would be as good as we had remembered.  And we sure weren't disappointed.\n\nWhile all the hype and kudos seems to go to Bacchanal these days, we have to say that we enjoyed Wicked Spoon more.  (Herb, strangely, doesn't like Bacchanal at all).  It's not as industrial high-tech looking as the other place, but it's decorated somewhat like the one at Red Rock, and it's comfortable.  It doesn't require walking through a maze or standing on long lines.  Our waiter, Stephen, was most congenial, friendly, and professional, and we enjoyed talking with him.\n\nWe loved a lot of the offerings.  I had the best octopus salad ever, and that goes for the individual Shepherd's Pie, with excellent quality beef and carrots that weren't mush.   Risotto with truffle oil, salmon with butternut squash, short rib pizza with blue cheese, and lamb panini were some of the other terrific offerings.  When I tried the leg of lamb - rare - it looked dried out but was anything but.  I put chimichurri sauce over it, and it was delicious.  Best of all, IMHO, none of the food was oversalted, deriving its good flavors from proper seasoning.  Desserts were wonderful, and I disagree with the reviewer who panned the gelato; my tiramisu and almond tastings were rich, creamy, and sinfully good.  And I have to admit to tasting some of the other desserts, too.  That huge strawberry dipped in Heath Bar Chocolate was irresistible!\n\nHerb just told me that today's LVRJ has an article about those Cosmo promos, but you have to fly from LAX to get it.  Too bad, our upcoming trip to LA will be that long, boring drive.  Maybe one of us should fly!\n\nWithout the promo, it would have cost us about $82 before tax, tip,  and alcohol.  With it, it was a great deal for an awesome buffet."

Hot, cold, desserts all are great, the only drawback to the big selection is that when there are times that don't get taken, they sit there for a long time and you can taste that.  It is the most I've spent on a buffet in Vegas, but it was worth it."

First of all, for the most part all of the food was cold. The selection was not the best for breakfast food which is what we were looking for more than lunch. I did have a scrambled egg dish that was disgusting. The first bite did not taste right, and I immediately ran to the restroom to dispose of it. I have not felt good since, and it's been 3 days. \n\nWe did not try other buffets, but would recommend doing so over eating at the Wicked Spoon. We will not be back on our next visit."

S'Well I was SUPER excited to go try WS because of all the hype, alas I was SUPER let down. We walked in and were seated in a timely manner, the total for 2 ppl for dinner was 75$ with tax. WOW! No local discount either, boo!\n\nWe are sitting there waiting for our server to take our drink order, and I was being inpatient so I just got up to go check it out. I was gone for about 10 mins and the lady had just took our drink order as I arrived. My bf goes up to get his goodies and I wait for my iced tea, I\'m super parched so I didnt wanna try anything just yet. Well I sat waiting for almost 10 mins and I was like eff it!!\n\nLet me back up and tell you about my journey around the buffet itself. I started to the right, and seen sushi. I\'m not a fan of fish or seafood really so I was like dang! I did get some shrimp roll thing though. Then I went onto the hot tables with all the pots, I got the gnocchi, some truffle potatoes, some shrimp thingy, some meat, and green beans. I then went on and got a caesar salad because the other had tomatoes and I hate tomatoes!  Some cod (I think)  and some bread. I then went and sat to enjoy my finds!! \n\nWELL I try the gnocchi first, and to me it was too "soft" it felt slimy-ish. I\'ve had gnocchi many times and this was the worst! It was super salty and just not yummy! I then went on to the beef,  which was hella hella bland! I\'ve seriously had better beef at Applebees! I looked for a salt shaker to no avail, then our lady FINALLY brings our drinks and I have to ask her for one. The salt really didnt help, so I decided th bunch the meat with the green beans. Finally something yummy... kinda. The green beans were literally the best thing there. I did have to add salt and butter though. So I then try stuff I usually NEVER eat, like seafood. The cod (i think) was tasteless, and the shrimp roll was no bueno! \n\nI\'m still hungry ok, and I have like 3 plates of food that were 1/4th eaten bc I wasnt pleased at all! So I go back to get some more green beans... I finally figured out were they had the mac n cheese station and was EXCITED! The cook was super nice and made my yummies, so back to my table I went. Well I tried it and was yet again not pleased! WTF?! I couldnt believe it! I was in shock! I finished my green beans and went off to the desert area.\n\nI got the choco strawberries, marshmallow, some red velvet log, some choc mousse cup thingy, and a fruit thing (sorry, I\'m not a foodie!!) Well I LOVED the strawberries, I actually loved it all! The marshmallow smores things were yummy and the red velvet (I think) log was also delish! I wanted to go back for more but my bf was pissed bc of the service (our server only checked on us 2wice and messed up our drink order) So we ended up leaving... STILL HUNGRY!\n\nOverall, the food is meh. Bland and tasteless IMO, the desert was totally yummy, and the service was shitty. I guess if I liked more of gourmet or had a wider palate I may like it, alas I do. I\'m used to eating cheap and yummy so I\'m ok with simple things. I may go back to try the brekkie or lunch, but who knows! It was def 75$ down the drain (literally bc I got sick later that night!!!!)\n\nNext'

S'Dude. I love buffets. Not actually ingesting the copious amounts of food, but the concept. When I saw that my hotel\'s buffet had a ridiculous rating on here, I decided to try it.\n\nWe arrived right before the dinner rush and got seated relatively quickly. The ambience and decor is very trendy and stylish yet warm and inviting, just like the rest of the hotel. \n\nAnd the food...ohhh the food. There are so many options it would be silly to list everything I had. There are all types of cuisines and types of food, and many of the dishes are very classy. You won\'t find any of the "yella" from Vegas Vacation here, but dishes with reductions and demi-glaces and shaved fennels and pan seared things and all kinds of other words that make dishes sound fancy. Most of the foods are served in small portion sizes and come in cute, petite skillets that fit in the palm of your hand - this is great because you can sample lots of things instead of dedicating yourself to a huge dish.\nThe desserts section is also mindblowing and diabetes-inducing and I am ashamed to say I tried most of the offerings there with my cohort.\n\nSome of my favorites: Shrimp and grits with gouda; broccoli cheese soup; shepherd\'s pie (though very very oily); stewed collard greens with ham hock; butternut squash ravioli; ALMOND JOY GELATO!; red velvet chocolate chip cookie.\n\nThis is borderline 5-star territory for me, and you should definitely go. But the crab legs were pretty dry, the pork shoulder was dry as well, and not many dishes COMPLETELY blew my mind. Then again, nothing was below "okay" status. \n\nExcept maybe the sushi.\n\nBut who the hell goes to Vegas for sushi?'

S'Easily our favorite buffet in Vegas. This buffet is quite unique because some items are already portioned into adorable mini pots and pans. This helped move the line quickly and stopped you for piling glutinous heaps of everything only to find you don\'t like it or can\'t finish it. Of course, if you want more, you can get more but we found d the portioned servings to be helpful; we left without that "Good god why did I do that to myself" feeling. \n\nThe food was great as was the selection. We would pick this over the Bellagio buffet any day. Oh, and did I mention a glass of champagne came with our lunch. They really knew the way to my heart.'

S'I visited Wicked Spoon 2x this year. Once in August for Sunday Brunch and once for the Monday brunch after Christmas. From what I remember, the Sunday brunch in August was SO much better than the Monday Brunch.  I understand that weekend brunches is when they have better food (and thus higher prices) but we were charged for a "holiday" price and it was not to the standards of a normal Sunday brunch but cost like $10 more! HMPH. \n\nThe good: I think it\'s really cute that they put some of their entrees in mini pots and pans pre-portioned. And their mini macaroons are super cute! There were lots of gelato flavors and the guy scooping it was funny/quirky. Their smoked salmon was really good too. \n\nThings to improve on: they need to expand their salad bar and cut more fruit.\nMake smaller portions of the pancakes? I felt bad cutting the pancake and taking only a quarter because I knew no one was going to get my sad leftovers. \nCoffee was horrible.  I couldnt drink more than a few gulps. \nWaiter services was pretty slow. We were left with empty drinks for quite a while until we saw our waiter again. \n\nLine wasn\'t too bad ~1 hr.'

I just think its smart for a business.\n\nNow to the food...\nThe plating and looks of the food was excellent.  The taste was nowhere near $41.  It was more like $9.99 food.  First of all everything was drenched in oil.  I felt like throwing up after the first bite.\nThe meat had bad flavor to it.  I think its five spice or something like that.  Im Asian and I hated it.  The ribs were tough and salty like beef jerky.  The lamb was good but too salty.  The puree with the salmon had an odd taste.  The calamari smelled fishy.  The crab legs were thin and not tasty at all.  Maybe they were just trying to mask the taste of ingredients that arent fresh?\nThe icecream was good though.  Actually the icecream was excellent! $41 for icecream!'

S"This review is for the Brunch buffet. Usually I go to dinner buffets, but a change of plans resulted in us coming here in the morning instead. Admission was $39 for a Monday brunch (for Labor Day weekend). \n\nThere's a variety of food to choose from! There's your breakfast choices such as pancakes, eggs benedict, omelette station, fruits and salad bar, etc. As for the entrees, there's the angry mac 'n cheese, artisan sausage, prime rib, bone marrow, seafood pasta, polenta, etc. Some memorable dishes would have to be the seafood pasta.\n\nA plus about this place is how they come in serving sizes such as in either small plates or cute little cups. They come in the right size sample so that you can try a little bit of everything!\n\nBesides the entrees, there's a juice bar! There's mango juice as well as grapefruit banana juice (my favorite!) In addition, there's cheeses, salad, as well as smoked salmon (I highly recommend!)\n\nAs for the desserts, there's two kinds of chocolate-dipped strawberries (with peanuts or with Oreos). In addition, there's your creme brulee, chocolate mousse desserts, pies and cakes, and (drum roll please)...ICE CREAM! I highly recommend the lemon and mango passion fruit sorbets! Absolutely sweet and refreshing!\n\nOverall, I would have to say that despite the steep price of $39, I was a satisfied customer. Moreover, I would definitely come here again for their dinner menu, which is bound to be much more tastier as well!"

I don't know what Deutsche Bank was thinking when they designed this place as everything seems to be so hidden, but it's definitely worth the adventure to get here.  \n\nGot a pretty good deal here since we came a bit before 11 so only paid the breakfast price of $17.99 and was able to get all the lunch stuff.  But I would of paid the lunch price since that's when the dessert section opens.  Holy shit, that's a nice spread and worth it.\n\nI like this buffet because although it lacks in variety, the quality of the food is amazing.  Alot of the food is already prepared in servings so you're not guessing how much to take.  But like most buffets, it's always great when they are new.  Let's see if they can keep it up."

S'I recently revisited Wicked Spoon after reading more positive reviews.  They offer brunch M-F too for $22.99 (new).  I highly recommend their brunch.  I went there over easter weekend.  The lines was short at 11:30am and it pays to pay with a credit card because I got to the self check out line and got a table in short minutes.  The food was great, especially tri tip, baked fried chicken, kalbi ribs, pizzas, salads, desserts.  I also had a free mimosa or bloody mary since it came with brunch. By 12:30pm, the line was long for getting a table so I am glad I got there early.'

S"Came here with my boyfriend the next night after having a negative experience at another buffet. It was the father's day special so we paid around $43 per person, with a wine tasting an additional cost. Since we went before it closed around 9pm we only had to wait to be seated for about 15-20 minutes. As soon as we were seated we were told to start and that our server would take our order for drinks as soon as we came back with our first plate. \n\nThe food was great and the variety made it almost impossible to not find something you like. As mentioned in previous reviews, a large majority of the dishes are served on individual plates which helps control portion size. Definitely try the mac and cheese, for us we had the lobster. It was neat to try dishes I've never had; quail, au grautin potatoes with truffle oil, different kinds of risottos, ect. I recommend starting on the far left with the appetizers buffet and moving to the right through meats, pastas, pizza, and eventually Asian food. Of course end with desert which is overwhelming, but does not lack variety in options. \n\nGo."

S"This buffet is not like any I've ever been to before.  They plate servings of their food on individual plates; you won't find any large trays of food sitting above blue flames here!  Also, every item of food sounds like something that could be on a menu at a nice restaurant.  Between me and my girlfriend, we tried a lot of the dishes, and I found that around 50% of the things I tried were delicious.  The other 50% were usually either too bland or too salty.  That being said, this was my first time at the Wicked Spoon, so I didn't really know what was good and what to avoid.\n\nMy favorite was the gnocchi, which was rich and creamy (almost ricotta status) and came in a creamy meat sauce.  The crab legs were cooked in lemon, butter and thyme, and it was very tasty and well cooked.  I had heard about the wonderful bone marrow, and I definitely love myself some osso bucco, but honestly, bone marrow by itself is not my cup of tea.  Maybe if I had thought to spread it on some french bread, my opinion would change, but alas, I did not think of it at the time.  General Tsao's chicken was good for the diner who doesn't like to stray from his/her Panda Express-comfort-zone.  Despite high expectations, truffled potatoes were just potatoes to my palate.  Green gazpacho was too acidic; I would forget the novelty and use red tomatoes next time.  I don't remember which pizza I tried, but ignoring the slightly stale-tasting crust, it was quite delicious; would definitely want to try this freshly baked.  This is all I can remember right now; if I remember anything else, I will add it on later.\n\nI was disappointed that I didn't read all the reviews about the wonders of the dessert bar beforehand, because we didn't allow any stomach vacancy for sweets.  We meant to... but I'm a savory guy at heart, and it's hard to stop myself when there's so much to try.\n\nBottom line:  I don't know if $35 is high or low for a nice, Vegas buffet, but (once my next paycheck gets cashed) I would hop right back in line at the Wicked Spoon, and go straight for the standouts from my last visit.  AND, I would save room for dessert!"

S"Every time we come to Vegas we are told by everyone to go to Wicked Spoon. But always skipped it because I just couldn't see coughing up almost $90 for two people for dinner. But after using our Aria room credit and starving for something good to eat for dinner we walked next door to finally try this buffet. You have to walk some through Cosmopolitan to find it. Its around this empty hallway full of art and classic posters. \n\nI have got to point out that EVERYONE working here is beyond friendly, helpful, and actually talkative. I waited for the mac and cheese bar and the guy making all the orders struck up conversations, made jokes, and was really efficient. Our server was also super nice and vigilant on refills and empty plates. And the gelato guy was really funny and quick. \n\nThey had a range of food from Japanese to Israeli to Spanish and even comfort food. I especially liked the ceviche, shepherd's pie, mac and cheese and oh god the desserts. But I skipped over or barely ate a lot of what I picked up. The prime rib had a lot of fat, the bool kogi was dry, and the sushi was average. But back to the desserts. I would say they had the best tasting desserts I've had at a buffet. Come on nutella gelato!!! your killing me! Macaroons, mini cakes, and cupcakes, oh my! I was in sugar heaven.\n\nThe place is nicely decorated. There wasn't that many people eating there. In fact there was no line at 7:30pm on a Saturday."

S"Our server pissed me off.  I ordered a salty dog (greyhound with a salt rim).  It came without a salt rim, just as a regular greyhound, and the bill was $16 and had it charged as a Moscow mule. We asked to have it changed on the bill, since I ended up with a plain grapefruit and vodka which was only $10 on the menu.  Rather than settling for the lower charge, she argues with us, talks smack about the bartender and blames the screw-up entirely on him, snatches my drink off the table and brings me back a salty dog with the most sparse salt rim I've ever seen (it literally only went halfway around) and still charges us $16. That's $6 for a few, barely-there crystals of salt, for anyone paying attention! \n\nAs for the food, it was definitely on the creative side for buffet food, but, unfortunately, still had the undersalted-sitting-in-a-steam-tray-for-hours buffet quality.  The mashed potatoes were good, I'll give 'em that. A couple of the pastas were serviceable.  Everything else was exactly what you'd expect.  And a lot of the items come in individual tiny little ramekins that take up your entire plate, so you have to go back for seconds many more times than you usually would.  Not sure if this is a tactic to get people to eat less for their money or not.  Hmmmm.  \n\nOverall, pretty disappointing.  You think you're paying more for unique menu offerings and implied higher quality, but it's all the same buffet rubbish."

S"2.5/5, +.5 for service\n\nNot so wicked anymore unfortunately.\n\nWicked Spoon was the talk of town the first time I was in Las Vegas in 2011, along with the Bellagio and Wynn buffets. However, in my most recent visit, Wicked Spoon has definitely slipped in quality, and with Bacchanal opening the focus is easily on them now.\n\nHowever, Wicked Spoon still has great variety for what it offers. I especially like the fact they have the small pots for many of their foods, so it encourages less waste (although people like my dad would grab 10 pots!). Their prime rib and dessert options are definitely on the plentiful side, so I guess if you're more into meat and not into seafood Wicked Spoon would still fit your appetite quite well.\n\nThe price, however, is not worth it especially comparing to Bacchanal. I paid the same price for both, but easily had a better buffet experience a few blocks north. I didn't manage to go back to Wynn this time around, but if their buffet is still good this place will be taken off my buffet to-do list.\n\nService was great though. The waiter constantly approached us to refill our drinks, asked if we wanted more, and greeted and said goodbye to us."

So my friends came back on Sunday instead, no line. \n\nI feel like because it was a Sunday, they skimped out on the variety of food selections. I was a bit disappointed with the range of what's available. There should've been more food! I was really REALLY surprised to see bone marrow though. I thought it'd be fabulous but it was too fatty for me. I felt my arteries clog up as I was swallowing it.\n\nDessert was good. Not great. Pretty though.\n\nAll you can drink wine can be added for $7. It's really not the best wine out there, reasonable since it's only $7. HOWEVER, all 3 of my friends that had the red wine ended up with stained lips, teeth and tongue for the rest of the night. VERY NOTICABLE. Gross."

S'I was there last Monday evening no line. The price, $38 per person and 50% off for children 12 and under. No bad for the selection and presentation of the food. I am a vegetarian and even if the selection is poor for a vegetarian (only 10% of the dishes, not counting the salads are vegetarian)  I was satisfied with the presentation and taste of the food.  One tip, they have a 15% discount for Marriott members. I like this place, but the 3 stars is for the lack of vegetarian dishes.'

S'Hate to sound like a typical American "fatty" but I have eaten a lot of buffets in my life that run the spectrum from growing up in a small town and frequenting Golden Corral (haha) to all you can eat sushi buffets that populate the West Coast.  The nice part about buffets are the options.\n\nWicked Spoon has a lot of great options.  You will find a sushi option with 3 different rolls and cold salad dishes; a standard salad bar with stuff like fruit; if you are going to the brunch buffet on the weekend they have muffins, toast, cereal staples along with tons of other options like a prime rib counter that serves other meat like lamb; various pasta dishes, casseroles (asiago polenta, roasted mushrooms), and steamed mussels and clams.  The clams were my favorite.  They also have shrimp cocktail though the weekend we went they did not have the snow crab.  We also did not get any complimentary mimosa like another reviewer noted back in the summer.\n\nIf you make it to the dessert bar you will find an array of pie and cake and gelato, plus chocolate covered strawberries.\n\nNote that when you arrive there are 2 lines:  the first line you wait in is where you will pay and get your "ticket".  Then you go get in another line with your ticket and wait to be seated.  Wicked Spoon can get popular and the wait can run more than an hour at times.  We waited about 20 minutes on a weekend in December.\n\nMy favorite buffet on the strip is still the Wynn\'s buffet.  It cannot be beaten in my mind but Wicked Spoon is still an excellent option.\n\nFor those who like to sleep in while in Vegas like I do:  The brunch buffet goes until 3PM.  Yessssssssss!'

S'My boyfriend and I were craving a buffet and i wanted to try a new buffett since i have been to a lot of them being from Vegas. I searched on google for best buffets and Wicked Spoon topped the list and you know what i have to agree.  We walked in and I paid it was a little pricey with 2 buffets and $16 tip it was $100 but WELL worth it. There wasnt any crappy cheap meats or frozen food here.  It was gourmet from the bone marrow and fish to lamb duck and a ton of desserts, lots of separate dishes at each station instead of one big huge catering dish to dig into.  The service was good. it wasnt packed and we stuffed ourselves silly with great food. I will definately be back my favorite was the sundried tomato mashed potatoes. yummmm'

My husband LOVED that they had gelato and someone to serve you at the gelato station. LOL. So many choices in different cuisines, that I ended up eating breakfast food, and then lunch food 30 minutes later.

Pass the Red and Black heel, take some photos,  and  bam you're there.  It was a pretty good find. 19$ for lunch and not that long of a wait. Most dishes are served tapa style, in small little plates or small pans. I like this concept because\nA) it doesnt allow you to put to much on your plate in one sitting and B) all the food doesnt touch each other.  Dont kid yourself though, you will end up overeating as the food is really good  and made with quality ingredients. Their gelato was probably the best Ive had at a buffet.  \n\nOnly pet peeve I had was they dont label half of their dishes, so you dont know what your getting and you have to end up asking them which is a pain when your hungry."

He made us gluten free french toast, brought regular toast, hashbrowns, an eggs bene for me, and pork belly fried rice.  He also gave us several items from the back to avoid cross contamination.  We were completely thrilled with our brunch, best meal of our trip to Vegas.  We really appreciated that he was so knowledgeable, took our food intolerance seriously and didn't seem irritated by going out of his way.

S"First off, let me say that I went here for lunch on a weekday. December 28th, 2010 to be exact. It cost $19. The decor of the buffet is amazing. You almost feel like you're in a fancy shmanzy restaurant. What I also thought was pretty cool is that they serve most of the food in these individual trays. So, you don't scoop it into your plate. Although this is cool, it definitely doesn't allow you to take a lot of food back to your table in one plate.\n\nSo, why the 2 stars? Cuz the food was disappointing. It was mostly pastas. No roast beef or prime rib, or crab legs. You would think one of these would at least be on the menu if you're paying $19. I just remember eating a lot of dim sum, some cheesy potato dish, and some pasta dish that I can't remember.\n\nMaybe I'll try this place for dinner to see if it is better before writing this place off."

S'i wanted to visit this buffet a year ago, but went to bellagio instead.  this time, we got a comp meal at wicked spoon buffet.  \n\narrived at 6:22pm on sunday of pres day.  the line is deceptive.  there are two lines: one for paying and one for seating.  took 21 minutes for us to get to the cashier.  then we were in the seating line which took forever like a line at disneyland.  time we stood in line to be seated??  1 hr 12 min.  I HAVE NEVER WAITED THAT LONG BEFORE *besides cheesecake factory in pasadena back in college, but we went planning to shop for an hour before going back.  we weren\'t cramped like sardines for that long like in the wicked spoon line.  would have been nice if we were offered water in line (they do that at the bellagio buffet line) *  we waited a total of 1.5+ hours finally be at our table.\n\n*NOTE: i called cosmo to ask about wicked spoon hours and whether we needed a reservation,etc.  the person told me, "the wait will be about 5-10 minutes.  you don\'t need a reservation or anything." WOW...REALLY?!?!?  =O\n\ni like the concept of little dishes but for me, it was a MAJOR FAIL IN EXECUTION.\n\nfood selection was not as much as i expected.  they had some food in little cute dishes.  there was a line for the meat...rotisserie pork shoulder, lamb, prime rib.  i don\'t remember the last time i was this disappointed at quality/taste of prime rib.  the prime rib i had at flavors buffet in harrah\'s yesterday was several times better than wicked spoon\'s.  the pork shoulder was more flavorful than the prime rib.  after eating some prime rib that was overcooked, i spit it out cuz it was that bad.. *i did it carefully when no one was looking*  SAD...\n\nthe mac n\' cheese bar is a novelty.  cool to pick your fixings and see the mac n\' cheese made before your eyes.  the people who serve food are very nice (at the meats, mac n\' cheese, etc). \n\ntruffled potatoes, creamed corn, beet salad, israeli couscous, asparagus were worth trying.  \n\ni tasted some of their asian food...omg, tasted like crap.  a lot of other food was either too salty or just plain bland.  \n\ncrab legs were good and cut in half so that you could easily get the meat out.  shrimp w/grits was okay.  fish was dry.  i rarely waste food.  pretty much whatever i get is what i eat.  but i had a lot of uneaten food on my plates..\n\ndessert..  there were two things i actually did like: pecan square tart and chocolate cake with caramel sauce on the bottom.  chocolate strawberries tasted good but they win the award (if there was one) of the sloppiest chocolate dipped oreo strawberries ever.\n\ni also asked for hot tea.  when the teapot arrive, the water was only lukewarm.  \n\ni don\'t care how fancy the place looks.  i\'m the type of person who comes for the food.  don\'t charge me extra for your fancy decor.  I AM HERE FOR THE FOOD!!\n\nSO WHY 1 STAR???  *they don\'t even get 2 stars for one free buffet*\n\nHERE\'S THE KICKER... hubby and i both had DIARRHEA 1.5 hours after consuming their buffet.  the food was not fresh.  it didn\'t look fresh...it didn\'t look appetizing...and sure you aren\'t supposed to judge a book by its cover, but one look and i knew (even though i still tried it to give it a chance).  \n\nso glad we didn\'t pay for 2 buffets.  not worth it.   i really should have stuck to my guns to go last year..  if you look at the pictures uploaded onto yelp, they are from last year.  definitely deteriorated in quality/taste??  when a buffet is newer, the place tries to impress the guests.  *i\'ve found that bellagio is the most consistent after over a decade+..*\n\n*Note: we would have been better off going to Flavors Buffet @ Harrah\'s since it would have cost us $10 each with the coupon.  no long ridiculous misleading wait, no diarrhea, no wasting that much time.'

S"Three thumbs up for the newest and best buffet (yet) at The Cosmo. This was our first time here and it was definitely worth the 45 minute wait. This includes the line to pay and the line to wait for your table (don't get cpnfused)! We paid $29 each for brunch (bottomless mimosas not included in this price). There were SOOOO many options to choose from! I loved how all the dishes were in small portions so you can try wverything. My favs were the French toast, prime rib, kalbi, mac n cheese, fried chicken, the salads (pre-maid), shrimp cocktail and lamb. The dessert ISLAND is amazing with a ton of choices - from cookies and gelato to chocolate peanut dipped strawberries to chocolate covered marshmallows. Dessert junkies beware! Ones I expected to be better were the eggs benedict (should not be pre-made) and orzo (no flavor). If you're looking for a bomb-ass buffet, you need to check this one out!"

S'Excellent! Have only tried two buffets in Vegas thus far but this one was my favorite. The price was a little expensive but the cashier told us it was because it was Thanksigiving weekend and there are many more additional foods provided including a traditional Thanksgiving meal. The ambiance in here was really nice with dim mood lighting and a more "trendy" feel that the other buffet I went too at the Aria. I loved the make your own Mac & Cheese bar and the mini fry buckets of fried chicken. The mini boxes of fried rice and the Korean Bul-kogi were also some of my favorites! The thanksgiving stuffing was also really delicious! I had seconds and thirds. The gelato bar at Wicked Spoon was also great! The Salted Caramel & Nutella were two of my favorites!

S"This place is awesome. Simple as that. If you want a great Vegas buffet that's not $50-60, then I fully recommend it.  Wicked Spoon is located in the beautiful Cosmopolitan Hotel.  This buffet is different from your typical Vegas buffet.  They pre-portion a lot of the food which is really cool so it prevents you from over loading your plate.  Yes, you can still eat as much as those pre-portioned items as you want, but I appreciated being able to get individual tiny boxes of chinese food, small salads, fried chicken, etc.  They have a lot of elevated buffet food as well like Ravioli with Duck Confit or Truffle Risotto or every single kind of meat you could ever want.  Our server was great and had no issues clearing our plates and refilling drinks when we needed them.  The food was legitimately good! It didn't taste like it had been sitting there all day.  I wish we had gone for the lunch instead of brunch so I could have tried out the taco bars that the omelette station replaced, but I guess i'll have to go again! Get there early because the line can build up fast!"

S'Maybe I went on a bad night or maybe went to late but eh the M buffet was still better. I think that they went above and beyond to add some "fanciness" to the buffet concept by having pre-measured portions and bottled water at your table. I think it\'s great idea to serve food in these dishes because it reduces the food waste and does make the food much more esthetically pleasing however, it does become a pain trying to put all those dishes on your plate. Plus, imagine how many of those dishes need to be washed on a daily basis! Let\'s not forget to mention, that almost every dish I picked up was cold. Yay for cold food!\n\nNow I\'m"m not really a dessert person but they did have stuff that looked interesting - chocolate covered strawberries. I will admit that I was sorta disappointed in their desserts. It was like the whole section was sugar-free.\n\nPaid $35 per person, waited in line for 35 mins, waited 15 mins for drinks, ate cold food, sealed the deal with sugar-free desserts, then paid $10 for a bottle of Tums.   Turned out to be a Wicked night after all.'

S"My sister and I heard about different buffets around town, but this one had the best yelp reviews, so we decided to try it out. We aren't big buffet people, but this was amazing. I had to do 2 laps before finally settling on where to begin. We came between breakfast and lunch - which, in my opinion, is a GREAT time to visit Wicked Spoon. Best of both worlds. I grabbed some lunch items that were being set out, and some breakfast items that were going quick! For some reason, their simplest salad [lettuce, feta, and some sort of vinaigrette] was my absolute favorite. Also delicous? The cobbler. I'm a vegetarian, and there aren't all that many veggie options, but I left satisfied, and so did my meat-eating sis."

They really don't look like much, but they are literally out of this world. \n\nADVICE: There are 2 lines. One line to pay and one line to actually get seated. If the line to get seated is long, have someone from your group stand in that line (make sure they pay you for their meal, unless you're like a baller or something) and those standing in the line to pay will just pay for the person who is holding down the fort in the seating line. Join your friend in the seating line when you've all paid. Best way to get in faster if there is a huge line. (if this was confusing, just message me)"

S'Best buffet in Vegas.  For an extra $10 you get bottomless mimosas for brunch.  How can you say no to that?\n\nWhen I walked into the buffet I thought they threw the lights up at a club.  The chairs on the walls look like tables and booths in a VIP area.\n\nThe buffet selection has all the usual Vegas suspects (prime rib, sushi, pasta, etc.).  The kicker was many of the hot main course dishes were served in little pots.  The chef basically forces you to eat small so you can sample more of the buffet.  Genius!\n\nThings That Were Awesome:\n++ Unlimited mimosas\n++ Portion sizes\n++ Banh mi.  Vietnamese sandwich/buns with pork and fresh jalepeno.  Could have used more stuffing but again, chef forces me to try more flavors.\n++ Yogurt parfait.  Add the raspberry puree/shots from the desert section and BAM! Super delicious.\n++ Chocolate and oreo covered strawberries.  How do we make perfection even more so?  Add my favorite store brand cookie, of course.  The strawberries on their own were delicious too.\n\nThings That Were Not So Awesome:\n-- The poor waitress got so many mimosa orders from me she was falling behind keeping up.\n-- Pancakes.  It was like I was eating (syrup covered) air.\n\nSo when am I returning to Vegas?'

S"I dug this buffet. Yeah, it's not 4-Michelin-starred impeccably created restaurant food, but it's... a Vegas... buffet. Usually these things are all about volume. \n\nAnd I really appreciated: a) the creativity of the dishes, b) the fact that there were many vegetables (really!) prepared in interesting ways, c) everything was well-cooked. \n\nThe concept is gourmet, creative food served in adorable dishes/spoons/mini-crock-pots, what-have-you. Expect such lovelies as: watermelon gazpacho, poached salmon with fried brussels, marrow bones as big as your freaking face, gnocchi with veal, korean shortrib pizza with pickled red onion... need I go on? Yeah. Not your typical buffet food. \n\nThere is a crab leg station and a mac-n-cheese bar, plus some buffet favs for the crowd. I skipped the crab legs, but was told they were really salty. \n\nAnd the desserts are a freaking work of art. Seriously. \n\nThere are a few negatives: a) selection's not as out of control as a normal buffet, b) price is around 35, which is merely decent, c) because of the plating concept, you can't grab tiny bits of everything or really load your plate down, which means many many trips. \n\nWorth trying, especially if you're a foodie. It's a unique concept with some fun dishes."

S'I\'d been looking forward to trying this unique buffet and wasn\'t disappointed. The food was great and I had the chance to try at least 10 thing that I\'d never tasted before and would never think to order in a restaurant (like cevice and shrimp and grits for example). The mac and cheese bar was great too.\n\nWICKED SPOON is a fraction of the size of other buffets, which is fine for the food part, but the desert offerings were underwhelming...\n\nWe got there at 8:30 and they told us "last call for food is at 9:15".  we noticed they shut the lights down even on the desert table at 9:15--which is where people were finishing up (and plenty were still eating). We were pretty much done by then but It felt pushy and cheap that they\'d shut down desert at the same time as the rest of the buffet.'

S'I\'m not quite sure why this buffet is as hyped up as it is. Maybe because it\'s "fairly" new and in the Cosmopolitan? Or maybe we just came on an off day. \n\nWe went on a Saturday and got there around 1pm and waited for about 30 minutes before got seated. They told us that the buffet closed at 3pm and reopened at 5pm...so it was definitely stuff yourself silly time. I don\'t know if the food was subpar because we came towards the end of lunch and the food was old or the chefs were just getting lazy. The food presentation was excellent if only the taste matched; mostly just bland or dry. The dessert section was probably the best thing they had due to the gelato selection and chocolate covered strawberries. I especially liked the chocolate mousse with passionfruit syrup (I think it was syrup, but it was definitely passionfruit).\n\nTo top it off the service was horrible. I know that it\'s getting close to their breaks probably in between lunch and dinner time. BUT, that\'s no excuse to not clean our plates off the table. It got to the point where we couldn\'t stack any more plates on top of each other at our own table. We had to start stacking plates on some empty table next to us because they were just not cleaning it. Seriously?\n\n\n I expected so much more out of it this place since it\'s a very nice casino/hotel.'

S'Wicked Spoon is not your average buffet! \n\nBefore our trip to Vegas, we had seen a special on the Travel Channel featuring buffets and Wicked Spoon was on the show - since we were staying at the Cosmpolitan we were interested (although we are not "buffet people"). We liked what we saw on the show and we were not disappointed when we tried Wicket Spoon on our trip to Vegas.\n\nWe went for dinner and wow, we loved all the "small bite" choices, you could try a bunch of things and not feel like you were totally pigging out or wasting food, it\'s almost like a tapas buffet. If you didn\'t care for what you tried, you could go back for something else.\n\nThe room is beautiful as well, and the $50/pp cost seemed reasonable to us, considering the variety - you could have a 4-course meal, and the desserts were out of this world -- again, small and manageable to try a bunch.\n\nService was good, plates were always cleaned off the table by the time you got back from another round.\n\nThey also have a "take out" option for $20, which is kinda nice if you are staying in the hotel and just want to camp out on your fabulous balcony and enjoy the view of the Strip.\n\nWe would go to Wicked Spoon again, regardless of whether we were staying at the Cosmo, definitely a nice dinner option, or maybe we will try for brunch next time.'

If you're not used to paying this price, don't go because you still have to remember that it's a buffet.\n\nThe portions are beautifully crafted (my initial take was to control portion waste) but its brilliant for reasons that you don't get people stirring around in the food, it gives it more of a high end feel and allows you to try everything! Just brilliant!! \n\nThe selection is smaller than what I'm normally used to though. A few of the Asian dishes were on the salty side but that may work for some people. Fried chicken wings (comes in 2 in its very own basket) was amazing--perfectly crispy, seasoned and freshly made. Salmon: good, salad: good, dessert: awesome, even for someone like me who doesn't have much of a sweet tooth. Seriously though, you can't go wrong with all you can eat gelato, right?! Right.\n\nIt appears there's a lot of hype about this place so you will have to wait a little to be seated and to get in your drink refills."

S"I regret that I forgot my camera when I came to dine here on Monday night.\nBut alas, the pictures on here will keep me drooling until my next vegas visit.\n \nWicked spoon is top pick in my vegas buffet list:\n1.    Wicked spoon, Cosmopolitan (see below)\n\n2.    Buffet at M Resort (great option if you are driving into vegas on the I-15, and you cannot have a meal without alcohol- beer&wine is included in the price. Basically the same food options as the Wynn but cheaper)\n\n3.    The Buffet at the Wynn (delicious, wide variety, awesome atmosphere but price point is high and the wait can be ridiculous)\n\n4.    The Buffet at Bellagio (experienced a 1.5hr wait on a Sunday at 8:30 pm...everything was either over salted, or missing that extra kick of flavor.)\n\n \nI love prime rib. Some people go to buffets for AYCE crab, or shrimp, or whatever may have you, but my listing greatly weighs upon prime rib.\nThe prime rib I had at wicked spoon was nicely medium to medium rare, and it was caught thinly enough so I don't have to chew on my meat like im some kind of crazy omnivore.  Tasted like meat, it was perfectly seasoned, and just super moist and savory.\nThe au jus wasn't just salt diluted in water!\nI attempted to get myself a third serving of prime rib but my stomach maxed out before that. Bummer.\n \nMy other highlights were:\n-grilled asparagus salad: perfectly grilled, light and refreshing dressing\n-shrimp and grits: in a small tapas style container, buttery grits and plump shrimp\n-Roasted suckling pig: I ate a slice and it was a bit salty but nevertheless moist.  Definitely a crowd pleaser when you stand in the buffet line\n-Roasted lamb: again, salty, but best lamb you can get in a buffet\n-BLT Salad: I love salad and this was a perfect mixture of salty...glad it wasn't a sandwich because I like to skip out on carbs as much as I can at buffets!\n-Fried green tomatoes: yum! It comes in a compact basket.\n \nOverall, they have a very sophisticated selection of salads, meats (bone marrow tower next to the prime rib.  Ab.normal), pasta, ethnic foods, dessert (home made marshmallows? Fancy.)  Their d\xc3\xa9cor is fancy and their service is top notch.  \nWear a dress or some baggy pants, and you will thank me later."

We came pretty early therefore there wasn't much of a line although it did take them forever to seat us even though the dining area was practically empty, which I felt was a little ridiculous.

They should really have these girls wear flats rather than heels if it's gonna take them that long to walk and set up the tables.\n\nThe food.

The dessert bar display was beautiful, anddd they had gelato! Except no hazelnut flavor = -1 points for them, but still, lots of sweets to choose from :) \n\nThe interior of the buffet was pretty cool. I don't know how to describe the design inside since it was kind of different/unique, and also kind of random, but it was pretty fancy for such an affordable buffet. \n\nThis buffet was not outstandingly exceptional, however, as in don't expect to find fancy or exotic cuisine here. But you will find all of your main dishes prepared quite well.

Everything I had was great except for the crab legs. They were a bit small and lacking in taste. The cavatelli with lamb was insane. Possibly the best dish there. The desserts were great and numerous. The gelato station was a lot of fun. To me this is the only reason to hit up the Cosmo. The rest of the hotel is boring. Full of bling but boring.

S"So.... You are at the Cosmo. Expect it to be expensive and decadent. But then again, you are in Vegas at the City Center! What more could you ask for? AYCE Bone Marrow perhaps? Gelatto? Seafood? Fancy salads? Pappardelle? This place serves it up. I advise arriving right when they open so you can avoid waiting in line for hours.\nI like this place because it keeps my portions on check. As stated by Cathy C, they use the pre-plated method. This system enables you to try everything without feeling like your plate is covered with glop's of food. Great for a gobble monster like myself. I adore the salad section. Don't get me wrong, I love my proteins, but found myself going back to the greens. I feel like they use minimal salt so that you can season to taste. The chimichurri sauce at the carving station is pretty flavorful though. Fair warning! Your breath will not smell so heavenly after eating the chimichurri!\nI think what you have to keep in mind is that you're not only paying for the upper echelon of buffets. You are also paying for the experience. Your first point of contact is the hostess who rings up your bill and another hostess who takes you to your table- both accommodating, happy and super nice. Every waiter I've had goes above and beyond the norm. Now, if you would rather be left alone to eat in peace and rather not spend the $cA-chiNg$ for a higher end all you can eat....

(around 6-7ish?) Everything was so good and I'm a bit of picky eater. The food is placed in cute little pots/dishes so its alot cleaner and doesn't have that lunch-lady feel to it. For me, buffets are part of the Vegas experience and this place totally satisfied me. Also, after stuffing myself with multiple plates, i didn't feel gross so that was even better.

I've been here several times for both and I would very much recommend coming here for lunch for their quality of food is just about the same! Also, the wait for dinner can be very long. \n\nThey have an appetizer area with various salads, cheeses, and many other types of specialties which always varies. They also have a macaroni bar where you can choose your own toppings to have mixed in into your personal bowl. Along with their huge selection of various entr\xc3\xa9e foods, they do have a sushi area, and a large dessert area with pretty little pastries/desserts as well as gelato. \n\nI love how they have some of their selections already separated into portions on a mini pan.

Buffets are supposed to showcase their talents that time.\n\nBeef brisket with polenta: polenta was really good. beef not so much. it was dry and tasteless. \n\ngnocchi with lamb ragu: boring, bland\n\nFor a Saturday night, their food selection was sparse, I saw a lot of dead space on the food displays. The dessert selection was FAR from what I saw in one of the pictures. Only the top two layers of the display had dessert on it.\n\n===============\nPros:\n\nPrime rib: tender flavorful moist\nmashed  potatoes: best i ever tasted\ntruffle scalloped potatoes: loved it but i wish it wasnt too filling\nchicken wings: just right\nceviche: so-so but i ate 2 servings of this mainly to clean my palate somewhat\npistacchio gelato and salted caramel vanilla gelato: heavenly\n\nService: the best buffet service\n=================\n\nI wanted to like this place but after thinking about my overall experience, there's a reason why, for a Saturday night, there were no lines anywhere in this buffet. Most of the items I liked were side dishes and dessert and the Cons I experienced were dishes that were supposed to be those center-stage.  For the value of your money, it's not worth it. The decor was nice and the food looked nice but you can't eat these things and you're in a buffet, you come here to eat your heart out. I wish they'd spend more time improving the taste of all their dishes instead of the decor. \n\nNext time I'll hit the Bacchanal instead."

S'After trying many buffet places in Vegas, We wanted to go check the best one and found this recommended by many online sites to be the best buffet in Vegas which It was NOT....First, It was expensive than the other buffets around...Second, The variety of food was not that great....No doubt that the presentation of the food was really good but the food lacked taste. There were a lot of healthy food choices and portion controlled servings but If you want to eat healthy, Buffet is not a good place to go...I like their small juice samples and nutty yogurt that was in the salad counter. Beef steaks were Horrible. Desert bar was awesome....Service was Alright too...'

S"Love the Cosmopolitan Hotel/Casino.  If you didn't know its a part of the Marriott resort family, therefore, being a Platium member they gave me and my boyfriend Brunch Buffett for two each night we stayed at the hotel for free!  Can't beat that deal.  They had a separate line where we didn't have to wait to pay/be seated.  The staff / hostesses were super friendly and remembered us each day that we were there.  The dood was very good and fresh.  Alll their dishes are served on small plates, which is great because you can try a variety of food.  Plus, I feel the food is presented better this way than out of a typical buffet platter.  \n\nDefinitely try the mac and cheese - Delish.\nEggs Benedict - Amazing\nFrench Toast - one of my favs!\nTo my suprise the Sushi was great!\nThey also had this Swiss Cake Roll lookalike thing but it was made with Red Velvet Cake.  It was to die for.  \n\nMy boyfriend loved the General Tso's chicken.\nAlso, the brunch buffet came with Mimosas, Bloody Mary, or Champagne.\n\nDefinitely will be back next time we are in the Vegas area!"

Much of the food is plated in little pots and pans that make it feel more sanitary and appealing.There is a great variety of food and it is good! \n\n I have been for brunch and for dinner; I much preferred the dinner food over the brunch. My favorite parts of the buffet were the mac & cheese station (they custom make your mac and cheese!) and the desserts. What can I say?

The leg of lamb was mediocre. \n\nThe carnitas taco was fair... Right down the middle. \n\nThe deserts were amazing! I could have just eaten those. \n\nThe walk through the cosmopolitan was great too. Modern style and interesting art. \n\nWas it worth $41 per person?

I like how they have small portion.\n\nPros: Excellent service, diverse food, menu is constantly changing, fresh fruits, shrimp cocktail, desert and ice cream. Excellent bacon.\n\nCon: Lack of beef dishes. No turkey breast, The korean food is average. The chinese food is average. \n\nOverall its a 4 star, they only thing that could change is a more meat selection or an improvement on chinese dishes'

S"My first buffet experience in LV, pretty happy with it! Dinner on weekends comes out to be $42 after tax, so it's not a cheap dinner, but it seems like most of the other buffets (eg Wynn) fall in the same price point.\n\nThe food ranged from OK - really tasty. A lot of the dishes use interesting/fancy ingredients, probably to make the buffet experience more worth it. I tried a handful of things I've never had before (calve's liver, wild boar sloppy joe, fois gras macaron??) which made dinner pretty fun. Most of the dishes are displayed in small portions for you to grab and go, which I found super convenient, especially for a buffet style restaurant. My method was to go through and grab one thing of everything I was interested in before I started eating, so I could gauge better what was worth a second go - super smart on me.\n\nI think they probably have a rotating menu, but quality is probably the same throughout the year, I'd rate it a 3.8/5. The prime rib (usually a big thing at these Vegas buffets I know) was just ok.\n\nDefinitely worth trying! I heard that dinner on a weekday is only ~$30."

S'This review was due for months...\n\n\nWe went to this buffet because it was supposed to be one of the best gourmet buffet.  They did have a lot gourmet food but I was disappointed that they did not served any filet mignon or lobster tails. It was over $40 per person.\n\nFood: 3.5/5    Plenty of food choices, they did have a good beef ribs, mac and cheese stations (to make your own) , asian food,  limited seafood selection, appetizers, sushi, and limited desserts selection. \n- Quality of food was pretty decent. Some of the presentations were great, some were just horrible!  \n\nAtmosphere:  4/5 great atmosphere ! took us a while to sit us down because their bottle is their cashier set up.  Other than that, the place was nicely theme with nice furniture.  \n\nService : 3/5  way too slow. Took too long to clean our plates up, to re-pour our water.  We did not see the waiter for a span of 20 minutes.  We had to look for him a few times.  \n\nOverall, i would consider to come again but just to try other food. However, my expectation are low now. There are other gourmet buffet that I will try first over this place.'

I have to say... this place was great!  I enjoyed the small servings as it gives you a chance to try things you might not normally try.  It was $105 for my wife and I to enjoy dinner and I think it was worth it. As mentioned we were able to sample things we wouldn't normally order from a restaurant.  \n\nSome of the highlights for us.... (keep in mind... small portions... looks like a lot.. it wasn't) \n\nLeg of lamb\nKing crab legs \nSpicy shrimp\nSpicy shrimp and grits\nShrimp cocktail\nMade to order mac-n-cheese (split this...large portion)\nWild Boar \nVariety of salads my wife sampled and enjoyed\nPolenta with truffle oil and pesto (awesome) \nGnocchi (really nice) \n\n--------------------------------------------------------\nDesserts \nDulce de Leche mini cakes\nMolten lava cake/raspberry sauce\nPeach cobbler ( my wife loved it so much.. .she had two... highly unusual for her) \n\n\nAll in all the place put out quality food and is well worth the visit. \n\nThe bone marrow... nothing amazing to be honest.. not a lot of flavor.\n\nAtmosphere... a little loud... but... being it's so popular and a buffet... it is to be expected. \n\nWe would recommend this place to others who are interested in enjoying a great buffet with a wide variety of menu items."

Oh woe is me!\n\nThe first thing I got was...BONE MARROW. I absolutely love bone marrow...but wicked spoon...all I tasted was fat! Just all FAT. I added some chimichurri, made it taste a bit better. I knew it was all pure fat but I ended up eating....5...\n\nThis buffet wasn't up to par in my palate. I mean the design and theme is wonderful. It's super cute! the only food entree that stood out to me was the veal sliders. YUM! it was super soft meat. \n\nThe dessert was just okay too. The chocolate covered strawberries were HUGE. Where the heck did they grow those? \n\nLater that night I still felt full and sick, and couldn't even drink anymore. :( Warning here is to not eat any of that fatty bone marrow..."

A lot of the dishes came in mini pots so greedy people couldn't scoop hella and then end up not eating it. If you like something, get another. If you don't, then you don't waste as much food if your greedy hand scooped too much. \n\nI felt their desserts were aiight--plus for the gelato though. Food wise: my favorite was one particular pasta, although I did enjoy the gnocchi with lamb! both HELLA GOOOD.

S"The Wicked Spoon was Wicked GOOD!\n\nI took a few moments to read some of the recent reviews and I am shocked!  I can only speak for the Sunday brunch but it was the best brunch buffet to ever hit these lips!!!    \n\nFrom the moment you walk into this building you feel like you have entered a scene from Sex and the City.  It is definitely Shabby Chic!  Not my particular style but I loved the energy and attention to detail this place has.  Someone said they got lost getting to the restaurant.  Hmmmm, I don't want to say they are stupid but they have these little signs that direct you right to it....lol  It is down an unassuming hallway that leads you past the hotel room elevators.  One can reasonably assume that the target audience for this restaurant is GUESTS FIRST.  Rightfully so in my opinion.\n\nPeople complaining about price....Really?  This is Vegas people!  Sure it is expensive but I can honestly say it was worth every dime.  If you want a cheap but okay buffet, head to the Rio.  This is an upscale place and the food was more single serving than buffet quality.  There are plenty of cheap buffets but I assure you that you will get what you pay for.  BTW, Prime Rib is being used as a test to see if a buffet is good?  When did the worst cut of beef become the standard?????...lol  Every time I read a review that mentions Prime Rib I stop reading.  They obviously don't know quality food if that is their biggest topic to discuss.\n\nThe food.....I was in heaven!  Individual servings of all you can eat food is not a negative thing.  It is a gift from God!  The temperature and quality are way easier to control and it cuts down on waste.  Again, lots of non restaurant people talking smack about things they have no knowledge about.  Tons of different options and tons of unique food choices to try.  You want to judge a buffet?  Do it by the quality of their bacon!  This place has the thickest, tastiest bacon of any buffet I have ever been too.  For goodness sakes, they even had slab bacon they would cut fresh for you!!!!  Omelett and egg station prepared any way you want it.  Fresh pecan french toast and pancakes.  Really?  If it were socially acceptable, i would have just eaten right off the serving dishes!\n\nDessert station.  Okay, lots of smaller desserts and most were delicious.  There were so many options that I wished I hadn't eaten that third helping of bacon so I could fit more in.  If you want their best dessert tho, hit up the gelato station first.  Their best flavor is the SALTED PEANUT.  It was AWESOME!\n\nI will be back but next time I am wearing sweat pants!!!!!!!!!!"

EVER!\n\nI learned of this buffet through my fellow yelpers. \nGood thing my group and I eat buffets around 4-5. \nWe got very lucky when we came here!\n\nWe had no idea when the buffet was open or closed. \nWe arrived to the entrance of the buffet around 430 to see it was closed and would open at 5. We were the first to arrive. Many other people later started to line up. As soon as 5 PM hit, my goodness, there was a line that wrapped all the way down to the escalator area!! WHOA! It's that great here huh?? The decor at the entrance was very Cosmopolitan hotel esque so we knew this buffet was serious.\n\nLucky us, paid at the front and stood in line for a table. We didn't wait long because we were first! I'm sure if you were to go during the dinner rush, there'd be a long wait!! But walking into the dining room, it was HUGE! Glass art hanging from the ceiling. The water carafes were cute couple serving size! \n\nThe plates- SQUARE!! About time buffets get the modern look! I love the square plate! I dunno about you, but I like portioning out my food in sections and the square shape helps it better :P\n\nThe food selection- ermahgerd!! The meat, the veggies, the cold foods, the asian, the desserts, and tons more!! There was a BIG selection! There wasn't anything i DIDNT try! I had at least one of everything. I'd say my favorite is their single serving of shrimp and grits! Whoa! What a nice spice to it!! I couldnt get enough of it. Had 3 pots sized!! I LOVE the single serving! What's neat is that people just want a nibble of everything. Sure we can scoop whatever amount we want, but sometimes we go overboard... I think some of the ready served portions are ideal. Of course, always go back for more if you want it!! \n\nI was a bit disappointed with their dessert bar. Don't get me wrong here. They had TONS OF YUMMY Bites! But they didn't have a crepe bar... maybe I'm a lover of crepes but please include it!! It's ok, I still lived without it. Love how cute their chocolate covered strawberries were made. They were better than any other of the buffets I've been to- yes, better than the Wynn! \n\nThe server we had was excellent, she was sweet and very accommodating to our party of 6. We all at least ordered at least 2-3 drinks amongst us. \n\nI'd definitely come back to this buffet again. It's a top 5 contender! It's tied with the Wynn buffet, hard to beat but they both offer something that the other doesn't."

I really feel like the quality of food is the same across the board for all Vegas buffets, they're never extraordinarily good but the food is made to taste exactly as it should.  But this buffet stands out because they serve most of their food in these individual portions of little pots and pans, so cute and pretty genius, your food never really mixes with each other on your plate.  And the place is really well designed and laid out.\n\nOkay the only complaint I have about this buffet is that their sushi sucks.  When I come to buffets, the 2 main places I'll hit up are the sushi and dessert and sadly this one really disappointed, too much rice and hardly any fish.  But all the other food was great, needless to say I was really satisfied.  They have an amazing dessert and gelato bar, come hungry :)"

Everyone knows you close with the Stones. Wicked Spoon is the Beatles to this experience. You feel warm, satisfied,  and even euphoric. You can almost hear Dear Prudence as you float from one tasting station to the other. It's a nice intro to Sympathy for the Devil you'll hear at Bacchanal. Both are excellent, but timing is everything."

This allows you to taste everything without weighing yourself down too much!\n\nTheir salad section was a bit lacking, but the rest of the plates were great. This buffet in particular had very interesting flavors and pairings. I would say it's a bit more gourmet than the average, but definitely not as high end as Wynn. \n\nTheir dessert bar is pretty stellar. Not only did they have 16 flavors of gelato (which Tiffany H. tried EVERY SINGLE FLAVOR!), they also had a nice selection of pastries and chocolate errthanggg. Their chocolate covered strawberries were the largest I've ever seen at a buffet! HUGE. I'm talking shari's berries sizes. \n\nIf you come here, you MUST try their chocolate cake (the one in the silver pan). It rests on a bed of delicious caramel sauce.

S'The Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmopolitan is definitely in the top 3 buffets of Las Vegas.  This upscale and modern buffet will please anyone who is hungry, and looking to dine with class.  The price is what you would expect from practically every top buffet in Vegas.  Unfortunately for me, I lost credit card roulette, and had to fork out a few hundred dollars for my friends.  Despite my loss, the food was great.  There was a lot of selection.  All the food was fresh, and very appealing to all the senses.  I absolutely loved the presentation of all the food.  They were all individually portioned already, and placed in a special plate, ready for the taking.  They even had a mini deep fryer to put the fried chicken in.  They also have an omelette bar which was excellent because I love breakfast food.  \n\nMake sure to save room for dessert because they have a vast dessert section too.  Ladies, you can take all the instagram pictures you want and post it on facebook for the world to see!  \n\nI would definitely come back in the future.'

S'Blech. I expected so much more from Wicked Spoon based on reviews and recommendations from friends, and left disappointed. \n\nOne upside: the service was great, and our server was attentive and friendly. \n\nNow the downsides: for one of the supposed "top tier" buffets in Vegas, the lack of selection was surprising. Yes, there are crab legs, but you can find those at any buffet in Vegas nowadays. Yes, there was bone marrow - the thing I was looking most forward to! - but for each bone you could get maybe a quarter teaspoon of marrow. And yes, the ice cream was delicious, but I was too busy scraping the remnants of the stalest macaron that I\'ve ever eaten off the roof of my mouth to enjoy it much.\n\nI imagine that the appeal of Wicked Spoon lies in how they\'ve covered their bases by including all of the "fan favourites" of the Vegas buffets: the aforementioned crab legs, fried chicken in cute baskets, a carving station, mac and cheese, etc. So, if you\'ve never tried any other buffet in Vegas, you will probably be satisfied. However, once you try any other buffet, you\'ll realize that it\'s missing a lot of things that might not be as novel or cute, but are nonetheless key to a good buffet: veggies (cooked or raw), fruit (of any kind), and international cuisine selections beyond a few types of sushi and some nachos and salsa. Not to mention that we were told that the fresh pasta station only had cream sauce, the soup of the day had run out, and instructed to use taco shells as nacho chips as they had also run out of those (mind you, the buffet was not busy when we went either). \n\nAnd the macaron! That hideous macaron! It had the taste and consistency of a mint that I had left in my purse for months and forgotten about. \n\nFor the regular $39/person for dinner, this was already not worth your money or time. For the $47/person "holiday" pricing, this was inexcusable. Do yourself a favour and head to the Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars instead.'

I went on a Saturday evening and it wasn't that crowded..yet. Our party of five got seated really quickly. However it's a bit of a walk to get to and find as it's pretty much on the other side of the casino on the second floor beyond Marquee (nice and quiet), just follow the signs and you should be fine.\nAs for the food, there is so much variety ranging from Chinese to Japanese to American.  What's really cool is the plating and presentation of the food. It's a bit cumbersome and I have to wonder, how do I fit this tiny dish on my regular dish piled already with food. Well you can either balance it or come back for another round, especially if your plate is filled with the prime rib and crab legs!\nThe desserts are really good.  I sampled all the pretty looking ones, and the flavor is amazing. The gellato bar is also highly recommended as well. I would definitely come back again next time I'm in Vegas."

S"Food: 5/5\nLocation: 5/5\nAmbiance: 5/5\nService: 4/5\nExperience: 5/5\n\n\nThe Verdict: 5/5\n\nI normally don't give 5/5 but this buffet does deserve this score.\n\nI visited The Wicked Spoon this past Oct 4th for their Lunch Buffet. How I've longed to eat at this place. Several of my friends had mentioned that this is the best buffet you can get in Las Vegas. I agree, partially! Haha\n\nIt's weird that I have some reservations in giving them a 5 rating when I did have some one off's.\n\nFood:\nThe selection like most buffets is indeed vast. There were several sections: The Salad Bar, The Omelet station, The Asian Section, Americana and the dessert bar.\n\nAt the salad bar, they have your everyday greens with some specialty items. They did have the not so normal, Kale salad and a cheese section. Also, at this station is some cold meats and smoked salmon, which is an upside in comparison to others. Also, they have a juice station, which included; watermelon drink, strawberry banana juice etc. \n\nThe American section had the usual carving station that had sausages, beef, ham, chicken and the norm. The highlight of this section, which is the most popular item perhaps, is the Bone Marrows. A mountain of gelatinous fat on roasted bones, what is not to like. I just found this to be okay, but I know that others may find it more exciting than how I actually found it to be. \n\nThe Asian section came with the usual, Sushi, noodles, fried rice, broccoli beef. The highlight in this section is probably the Korean Short Rib BBQ. I know for a fact that a pound of uncook ribs goes easily for $10 a pound, when at the wicked spoon comes in heaps. The Ribs was exactly how it supposed to be, tangy, sweet and delicious.\n\nThe dessert bar is big. A  variety of dessert. A definite standout is the chilled white chocolate cake that is filled with passion fruit crema - Excellent!!\n\nThe lunch deal which was around $26 plus tax is definitely a great deal. Although from what I heard, the price doubles during dinner because at that time seafood is available.\n\nI recommend this and agree that this just might be the best buffet. Located at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, which in my opinion is the best hotel at the strip at this moment.\n\nVerdict - Strongly Recommended"

I've been here a few times and never have I had a problem with anything here. The customer service is also great and the selection of food is awesome. I highly recomend it and will be coming back soon, maybe this time for dinner. I say you try a little bit of everything than a lot of one thing.. Enjoy.."

S"I enjoyed my first meal at Wicked Spoon after reading and hearing about what it had to offer for several months. We had a party of about 25 on a Saturday night before hitting The Chandelier bar at The Cosmopolitan. Some of the things I enjoyed was the roasted bone marrow which I spread on some challah bread & topped with a sprinkling of sea salt flakes. The combination was so sacrilegious but oh so damn tasty. Yumm. I had seconds so that was double the sin. I also liked the different salumi & other deli meats that you could pair with various crackers & cheese. The batter fried squid on a stick was delicious. The pan fried chow mein had good flavor. The furukake covered shrimp balls was mighty tasty. The lettuce cups filled with bamboo shoots and char siu pork in asian spices was also quite tasty.\n\nFor dessert, I liked the salted caramel macarons which we thought was all out and it gave the females in the group a lightweight anxiety attack. Thankfully, 10 minutes later they reloaded. Wheww! Crisis averted. The standard coconut macaroons were also good. I really enjoyed the apple cobbler. It was still warm and tasted great. The miniature eclairs were just ok. I thought they would be better. \n\nWicked Spoon is good. I recommend it. I like the different spin on the typical Vegas all-you-can-eat buffets. There was so much food to choose from that it's a little overwhelming at first. Service was good. They were always on top of clearing away our plates, refilling our drinks and offering us coffee at the end of the meal. The customer service of the waitstaff was really good. Would I go to Wicked Spoon again?? Yes. I definitely would."

S"Wicked Spoon's an interesting buffet place with a wide variety of different food. I came here during brunch to get some food. Even though it was brunch time, there was pizza, chicken wings, sliced beef, etc. The buffet also had your usual breakfast food items.\n\n== Food ==\n\nBrunch was pretty good here. They have Eggs Benedict here! Comes with salmon or pork. The soft boiled egg is cooked just about right with a nice gooey inside.\n\nThere's bone marrow here for everyone who's interested. I haven't seen a buffet serve up bone marrow before, but it's not my cup of tea.\n\nThere's various cuts of meat here also such as sausages, beef, and pork. They were all delicious and tender. \n\nThere's a very wide variety of desserts ranging from cakes to ice cream. They are alright, but everything tasted pretty blank on the dessert side. Nothing special, but it wasn't bad either.\n\n== Service ==\n\nService was pretty good. The waitress came around often enough to refill drinks.\n\n== Overall ==\n\nThe eggs benedict makes this buffet stand out. The various cuts of meat here is good too. Definitely worth the money."

S'$35 for lunch buffet (was here on 12/22/13)\n\neverything here is great. I enjoyed many of the items here. I only wish that they have crab legs. For $35 i don\'t expect to see king crabs, but at least snow crabs; plus it was a holiday weekend that I visited. \n\neverything here is presented "cutely" which makes the food looks good, however it actually tasted good. The fried chicken here was much better than Bacchanal\'s. The chicken actually had taste and it was not dry.\n\ni really enjoyed the sirloin, it was perfectly cooked and was juicy.\nMost of their pasta dishes were good, from their mushroom risotto to angry mac and cheese -- all tasted way better than Bacchanal\'s, i thought.\n\nTheir cured meat selections were just meh. I liked Bacchanal\'s way better for that. \nSushi section was sad; all cheap sushi rolls and no nigiri, just plain regular sushi rolls with fake crab meat (not even california rolls). it\'s like the korean version of sushi. I didn\'t eat anything from that section. \n\nDesserts were decent: their chocolate dipped strawberries were big and to be honest i did find Bacchanal\'s dessert section much better.\n\nOverall the experience at Wicked Spoon is how i expected. It was good and different - a place for those who cares about presentations.'

S"We made it barely before closing (no line!)- I didn't expect a Vegas buffet to close at 2pm, especially when that's when many are waking up after a long night. The brunch buffet comes with a complimentary glass of champagne or mimosa, which I thought was nice. \n\nThe items here are much daintier and interesting that the Bellagio buffet. I'm personally not excited by waffles and scrambled eggs, and they had more lunch items on the line. There was a great (but salty) house cured thick slab bacon, cute little skillets of goat cheese ravioli, cold salads of asparagus with tarragon vinaigrette, neat individual portions of smoked salmon, and Moroccan chicken. \n\nThe best part was the dessert section. The desserts were actually good! They had macaroons (yum!), little cups of desserts (the one that looks like tiramisu with crunchy bits in the middle was pretty decent), chocolate covered strawberries, and an entire case of gelato that they serve, not a machine. Don't be shy here- they give you a cute little scoop spoon, so you can try more flavors. \n\nI'd probably say 3.5 stars, but I rounded down because the carving station guy was terrible. He was grumpy and rude when asking people what they wanted. He expects your plate to be ready to catch the sausage... mine wasn't, and he ended up flinging the sausage at my shirt leaving a stain."

S'The phrase that comes to mind when describing this place is "quality not quantity."  This place is Amazing! i loved it! I can\'t say enough about it.  \n      The food they had was everything that I love.  They had a lot of the type of sides you would find at like Ruth Chris\'s. The presentation on these dishes was so cool and unique, like the little Chinese takeout boxes.\n   I was in foodie Disneyland, so far this is in the top 3 buffets for me.  The other two great ones are at the Wynn, and the Buchannal at Ceasars.  Wicked Spoon may be my favorite though.  When googling buffets, another one that\'s supposed to be great is the one at the M Resort.  Let me tell you, that was a huge dissapointment - mediocre. This place is LEVELS above!!'

S'Disappointing.  We were here a few years ago so I can confidently say the quality has gone downhill.  There is a large selection of food but it is not as diverse or delicious as it used to be.  The food is still good, but not great.  The presentation is decent, but probably not great in terms of food handling.  The shrimp cocktail was particularly bad in that it was sitting directly in a huge pile of ice which looked nice, but made the shrimp taste like ice... which tastes like nothing.  The tub of cocktail sauce that had been spilled all over and was warm was also less than appetizing.  The desserts were the final straw, they looked amazing but tasted terribly, seriously - inedible.  The service was slow and slightly forgetful.  The entire place needs a facelift, the carpets are getting gross, the tables and decor outdated and in need of repair.  \nAgain, the food is good but not great - there are better options, specifically I would recommend the Wicked Spoon next door at the Cosmopolitan.  The Bellagio is going to have to work much harder to compete.'

S'I wish, so badly, that I could give this a decent review. We stayed at the Bellagio for a week, and it was LOVELY. The buffet, on the other hand, was not. We decided, at the last minute, to visit for dinner. While the selection of main dishes was huge, the food itself was NOT. The crab legs & shrimp were watery/mushy & rather tasteless. The "kobe beef" was a bit on the stringy/tough side. The salmon was over-cooked. The blue fish was mushy. The veggie side dishes were good. A large variety of desserts were available, and in an effort to taste as many as possible without wasting, my husband & I each got several and then halved & swapped. They were beautifully presented; I wish they had come close to tasting as wonderful as they looked. In short, we were horribly disappointed. If you don\'t try, you won\'t know, but really....for the $86 it cost us (as a couple) to "try", I can\'t help but wish we never knew. Sorry, Bellagio.'

S"This is kid of weird for me, b/c I'm not a fan of buffets at all. I ate here when it first opened, but I recently returned here on another vegas trip, and you know what, it was pretty good. I liked the variety of food they have, and to me, a lot of buffets end up tasting the same after a while. This was actually not the case, they had quite a few things I found to be good. I liked the crab legs, the rack of lamb, and the spicy tuna hand rolls were awesome. I don't spend a lot of time on desserts but some friends thought they were adequate. I also did like the crepes they had, the chicken and mushroom was also worth noting. I wish I could of tried more, but tried not to over indulge due to me dieting, but I wish I wasn't."

S"I was a newbie to the Las Vegas buffet scene so I thought I'd go big. There was certainly plenty of food to choose, all in general pretty high quality for a buffet. I really liked the prime rib, but the crab wasn't all that great. Even though the line outside looked daunting it moved quickly and my party of 10 were seated promptly. The interior is noting special, pretty disappointing, actually. I assumed some of that high price went to having a nice ambiance, but it was pretty plain (I hear the wynn is nice). Overall, I was happy I had come, although I probably will not make a return visit next time I'm in Vegas.. $40 was a little too steep for me.

I would describe this as the best that you can get as far as buffets go, with Wynn at a close 2nd. \n\nWhen I eat here, I go crazy on the King Crab Legs. Just eating a few of these babies, and there's your money back already =) If there are no big pieces left, just wait a few minutes because they always replenish the supply every now and then. \n\nAlso they have a very wide range of premium sushi here. From hand rolls, rolls with the seaweed cone and regular sushi. The Salmon pieces on the sushi are very very fresh, and what I do is just eat the Salmon and throw the rice away. Shiet, I'm not wasting my stomach on rice. haha. I've only been here during the holiday season, and they do tend to rack up the prices for federal holidays. But still, this place gets my vote for best buffet in Vegas. Lines can be quite long, so try and get there around 5:30pm for dinner time."

S"As some of the reviews state, yes there is definitely a wait, and yes, the cashiers are definitely not the most pleasant people... but overall, I thought this buffet was well worth the $40. I can't even remember the last time I went to a buffet, but I loved all the choices here. And it never felt too crowded while getting food. Lots of different meats, seafood, and pastas. Crab legs, sushi, and kobe beef. Italian pastas, chinese food, turkey and sweet potatoes, tacos, pizzas, etc. You name it, it was probably there in some form. The desserts were good too (bread pudding, brownies, cheesecake, tiramisu, etc.) \n\nOverall, I was a little disappointed with the crab and the sushi, but the salmon and pesto tortellini made up for it. While in Vegas, this was probably my wisest food purchase of the week. The strip is so expensive anyway, trying to go cheap usually means sacrificing quality while still paying an inflated price. Just go to a buffet :)"

Once sat, I was greeted promptly by a server and provide with a drink.   I started with the seafood section and the crab legs were delicious.   Next I hit the Asian and BBQ sections of the buffet.   Both had many different options.   Service was great and the good was second to none.   If your in the mood for a superior vegas buffet, I strongly suggest Bellagio Buffet!'

S"We tried this a couple of days after going to the Aria buffet and were really surprised it didn't give Aria more competition. Soft serve ice cream instead of gelato, Bellagio? Seriously, soft serve? \n\nThere were bananas Foster (not superlative) and very nice creme brulee, one of our favorites.\n\nThe prime rib was very good, as was the au jus. The crab legs and shrimp were good but standard fare. The sushi selection was rather disappointing, especially compared to Aria. \n\nThe plusses were few and far between. There was an excellent selection of picture-perfect fresh fruit and a nice garnish bar with olives and nuts included. In contrast, the bread was below lackluster. At Aria I actually was tempted into two selections; at Bellagio it was easy to skip breads completely. The soups were boring and not at all tempting even though there were several selections available. I kept wandering around thinking I might have missed something, but no, I had not. \n\nMy first glass of lemonade was fine. The next one was watery; the replacement wasn't very good either.

S'I took pity on The Bellagio.  You see, I am the king of buffets around the country.  King R, the Inhaler.  I\'ve closed more buffet lines than there are stars in the sky.  My photo is posted at most of the Chinese buffets around Chicago; they see me enter their restaurants, and they say, "WE CLOSED.  GO AWAY."  Because I can eat some buffet, and if it\'s an all you can eat buffet, well...count your day\'s profit goodbye.  See me, and you better get on the phone to your wholesaler for next day\'s delivery.\n\nAnd The Bellagio opened the next day because I didn\'t eat every damn morsel of food they have.  I witnessed and gently sampled their scrumptious array of fabulous food.  Heavy on seafood (the Bellagio is known for a large Asian gambling clientele), two full display cases of beautiful desserts, and service that rivaled even some of the best restaurants I\'ve eaten at (thank you Eljon!).\n\nMy only complaint, and thank you Paul A. who mentioned this, is that for a supposedly smoke-free restaurant, I smelled more nasty air blasting in from the casino than some of the other restaurants in casinos I visited.  For a place like the Bellagio, I was very surprised.  Alas, no star deductions for excess, errant carcinogens.  It\'s not the chef, waiter or food prep people\'s faults.\n\nA piece of advice for those who complain about the long-ass line/wait queue: if you want to dine here, make sure you GO BEFORE 6pm.  I went just before 6pm on a weekday, and by 6:45, the line was insane.  But it\'s like that at most other buffets, so quit bitching.'

S'Had the gourmet dinner on Saturday Night for over $40 with tax and tip.\n\nThe line was out the door, but moved fast.

They were pretty average.. slightly seasoned, but overcooked to my taste, and not too juicy.   I had had worse though.  \n\nFor dessert, I did NOT see ANY chocolate covered strawberries.  The self serve Ice cream is a JOKE.  It\'s the same stuff you\'d find at Souplantation, Sizzler, or Hometown buffet.  No hand scooped Gelato or Ice Cream I\'ve seen at middle tier buffets, and for much less ($8.95 at the M Resort)\n\nThey did have creme brulee, which was mediocre quality.  There were cream puffs, eclairs, brownies..\n\nI did see some pretzel bread, and it wasn\'t bad.\n\nAlot of low end stuff was seen.. .. if you go.. stick with the lamb.. \n\nOverall, the Wynn isn\'t any better IMO.  I think the Wynn is even more expensive.  The Wynn may have better ice cream, and their lamb may be slightly better when or if they have it.  Read my review for the Wynn, but I didn\'t go on a weekend where they may have higher prices, and better fare.'

S"It really is Sin City... or at least Sloth City - I ate prime rib, shrimp, lamb, and eggs benedict for breakfast.  \n\nThis buffet is a really great value at $17.   All the dishes are fresh and quality.  I think I ate about 50 of the sweet shrimp while I was still shopping for more food to load on my plate before I even sat down.  Although I'm a fan of the fancy cuts of meat and all that, the eggs benedict and their hollandaise sauce were an unexpected highlight to the meal.  The service is also very fast here as they will give you plenty of coffee, water, and juice to fight the hangover from the night before so you can boot and rally.\n\nI have yet to try the Wynn buffet even though I stayed there so maybe next time that will be my comparison."

S'Not only one of the best buffets in Las Vegas but also one of the best ever!\nLess then $40 (including tax and tip!) per person gets you a high quality meal with endless options.\n\nFavourites:\n*KOBE BEEF!\n*house-made sausage\n*French macarons for dessert.\n\nThe Kobe beef alone is worth the price of admission.  It is listed as Kobe but even if it is actually American-bred Wagyu beef (a common trick) it is still a value as even Wagyu is high priced at most restaurants.  No fussy sauces or spices, just salt and pepper on the roasted meat, let the flavour of the beef shine.\n\nThe house-made sausages are grilled with peppers and onions to enhance their flavour but I like them alone.  They offered sweet and spicy versions on the night I went and both were delicious.\n\nFrench macarons are one of those simple-looking pastries that are actually quite difficult to execute perfectly.  All the desserts were high quality but the macarons stood out to me.  These was p\xc3\xa2tisserie quality macarons with the perfect amount of slight chewiness to the bite and no crumbling whatsoever.  Only strawberry was offered but they were perfect and would have been at least $2-$2.50 EACH at a French cafe.\n\nThis is a must stop for those Vegas buffet-lovers out there.  The only other buffet at this level is at the Wynn but theirs is slightly more expensive.'

Certainly not as good as Paris, but a solid second tier option for those looking to eat a ton.\n\nService was excellent and the line was short, so that was a plus, as well.\n\nA bit pricey, but you get what you pay for.

Recovering from the power nap, you find yourself having dinner rather late.\n\nFriends and I found ourselves wrestling between Bellagio buffet or Mirage buffet for dinner.  By the time we had made our minds and sauntered across the street from our hotel, watched a round of dancing water to Frank Sinatra, we arrived at the buffet at the tail end of dinner service.\n\nSomething tells me the food would have been better if we were maybe an hour or two earlier.\n\nNot that it was bad, it's just some of it tasted like it had been out there for awhile.  It was nothing to write home about.  Nothing near the 5 stars.  The staff looked a bit drained.  We wanted to order coffee at the end of dinner but decided against it as I was frightened the reaction we'd get from the staff who had already begun to fold napkins for tomorrow's breakfast service.\n\nI only ate the sushi because I have balls.

I think it was dinner price but I went in at 4:30pm.\n\nWe got seated rather quickly because it was kinda early for dinner time.\n\nThere was nothing special about the food. very mediocre. Sushi was mediocre-it didn't taste as fresh as I had hoped.\n\nDessert was NOT good. It looks really good & pretty though. To get my money's worth, I tried a bite of every single dessert they had. haha, yes my taste buds got a little confused here and there. Hands down, the creme brulee was the best! That one is the only one worth trying in my opinion :) Cheesecake was alright but like I said, nothing special.\n\nA random note: They have ostrich there..\nI'm a pescetarian so I don't eat that stuff but my friends all tried it and had to spit it out and chase it down with soda..I guess you can try if you want. Maybe it's an acquired taste but just a slight warning..it smells & looks pretty gross.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give this 2 stars instead of 3 is because our waiter was super friendly. He kept coming back to take away our plates & refill our drinks.\n\nAll in all, try a different buffet. I hear Mirage was better but have never actually tried it.

Everything is so good. It tasts like home cooked food and not rushed buffet food.\n I am vegetarian and I couldn't believe the selection of vegetarian options at Wynn. I filled up my plate without making it to the end of the buffet line. And then I made another round and finished to the end of the buffet. I felt like I was in a vegetarian restaurant. Then I tasted everything. There was no flavor AT ALL in the meatless dishes. Most important part of being a chef is knowing how to season dishes. Wynn needs new chefs."

It had almost a sweet taste to it. Do they not know how to season their food?\n\nTheir only redeeming quality was the variety of desserts offered, none were great but they were good and there sure were a lot.\n\nIn the end, the desserts can't make up for the hefty $40+ price."

So, I went back on this trip to get some crab legs, and now the dessert options are probably what will bring me back next time. I can't wait to see how they will one-up themselves next.\n\nHere is the low-down: pre-split king crab legs and a pot of clarified butter, along with the finest chocolatey desserts ever found in a buffet, paired up with delicious angus roast beef and sushi-grade tuna/salmon and roast duck and quail and everything else you would ever want from a buffet. \n\nThe kicker: $30. And its at the Bellagio, so you won't feel like you're a cheapass for going to a buffet instead of a pricey 5-star joint. Need more proof that its good? How many other buffets have a snaking line in front of them? The 20 minute wait is absolutely worth it, and everyone in that line knows it, so just join them and wait for the glory.\n\nI've always stood by my opinion that this is the best buffet in Vegas based on food and price and location, and I'm sticking to it yet again."

S'One of the best buffets on the strip.  They have such a large selection of food, it\'s sure to make anyone happy.  The prime rib and king crab legs (which are sliced lengthwise, so all you need to do is scoop the meat out) are favorites, and you won\'t be disappointed.  \n\nOnly reason I cannot bring myself to give 5 stars is mostly because of the wait.  Unless you manage to get yourself on one of those super-exclusive "I am a high roller and make more money than you" lists, you will wait in a rather long line at night with the rest of the commonfolk.  Staff is courteous for the most part, and the waiters/waitresses were pleasant and got drink orders to us timely.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely go back again.'

S'My girlfriend and I visited this place a couple of days ago. Overall, a good lunch, but "good" is not what I expected from the Bellagio. In fact, I preferred the desserts more than any of the other dishes. \n\nThe sliders didn\'t have much flavor, and the buns were too dry. The turkey, too, was dry, and I thought the lamb tasted a little gamey. The mashed sweet potatoes were way too sweetened with (I think) cinnamon and maple. It took 5 minutes before we got our first drink, and we had to flag down the server to get a refill. \n\nAgain, I would have to say this was a decent experience overall, but the various little problems still left me feeling disappointed. Yes, it was lunch on a Thursday, but shouldn\'t a place like the Bellagio be on top of its game everyday?'

Bellagio buffet is large, straightforward, not exactly opulent, but certainly nice and consistent enough to make one feel pretty good about paying the high-ish but rather reasonable price.  \n\nI've eaten here twice in two different trips to Vegas, each time pretty satisfied.  The selections are impressive and mostly good quality, though not any particular item stands out as amazing.  The Asian foods are not so great.  Rather than going for a fun or super posh interior, Bellagio chose sort of a nondescript upscale food court look that gets the job done but is in no way memorable.  \n\nSo in sum a solid, if not outstanding buffet."

S"YUMM-O!  Me, I'm a huge HUGE fan of buffets because you get all you can eat for one (sometimes low) price!  Seriously, I love to eat.  And more often than not I care about quantity over quality.  Yes I know I should get out of that habit.  In fact, the buffets are one of the reasons I moved to Las Vegas to go to UNLV!  We just don't have spreads of buffets all over Hawaii, and to me this was heaven.\n\nI'm older now, and my metabolism is slowin' down just a tiny bit...the pooch shows from too much eatin' if there's no cardio runnin'!  Gone are the days of eating cold pizza for breakfast, Reubens from the dining commons for lunch (God I love those things), In-N-Out for dinner, and beer for dessert!  I've noticed my palatte gets tired of the same old thing too, my taste buds like to be surprised every once in a while.  \n\nThis buffet brings back lots of memories.  Back in college, it was the first 'gourmet' buffet my school homies had ever been to.  I remember the Sunday brunch fondly, where else could we go and drink all the mimosas we wanted?  Getting hammered at breakfast seemed like a nice option at the time!  Not too shabby back then for only $25!  We felt like big spenders!\n\nIt's been a long time but the food is still good.  I took the kids there for their first ever fancy buffet (believe me, they're used to buffets like the one at Station Casinos but that's another review for another time) and boy were they surprised!  Like, eyes wide open and drooling surprised!  They couldn't believe this much food could be in one place.\n\nThanks to me, we were at the buffet well over 2 hours and got a little sample (okay, large sample) of what the Bellagio had to offer for lunch and dinner.  More on this later.  Anyway, we tried just about everything they had!  We went to town, the kids went APE-$**T!  If it was edible, it was put on a plate.  There was mounds of crab legs (which the little one loved because they were already cut in half, she had 2 plates), succulent prime rib, Angus beef sliders, pizza after gourmet pizza (Shrimp Scampi was my fav), veggie spring rolls, spare ribs, Kobe sirloin, lamb chops, and Beef Wellington was enjoyed by all.  We even tried lots of different stuff, like hand rolled sushi rolls, venison, duck confit (yum!),  roasted elk, ostrich, Chilean sea bass, seafood vol au vent (seafood in puff pastry), and steak tartar!  Fancy, fancy y'all!  \n\nThe food buzz was kickin' in but no one had even touched dessert yet!  Dessert ran rampant in this place!  We of course, had a bit of everything we could fit.  Creme brulee, cappuccino mousse, lemon tarts, fruit tarts, chocolate cake, tiramisu, oh so many more we stuffed our faces with!  I was totally, utterly full after this meal.  I for sure made the kids eat our money's worth as well!  This place ain't cheap!  But they loved it!!\n\nWanna sample as much gluttony as possible!  Best tip I can give you, go to the Bellagio for lunch but go late at like 3 PM.  Pay $20 + tax to get in, enjoy the last offerings of lunch...then prepare for dinner!  Dinner items start rolling out at around 3:30 PM.  Good thing too because the gourmet dinner costs upward of $38 + tax depending on whether or not it's a holiday or a weekend.  Save your A$$ some money in this recession!  You can use that money for TUMS afterwards."

It has sushi (yum) and is definitely more gourmet than any other buffet that i've tried.  At the end of the day though, it's still just a buffet... which means the food stays out too long and its mass produced.  It's a solid 3.5 to 4 star place.  if you think you're going to have a gastronomical orgasm here, you're mistaken.  Try Fleur De Lys in the Mandalay if you want the best dining experience in Vegas. and for the best meat... go to lawry's off the strip. hands down the best prime rib on the planet."

The sirloin was quite dry, but the shrimp was really good as were the mushrooms, asparagus.  Pizza was good because its pizza but nothing too special.\n\nWait was standing in a Disneyland-like line for 45 minutes.  The wait isn't that long, but being confined to standing in an un-moving line is very tedious.\n\nThe service was great, I actually had a re-fill (or two) for each plate I got.  That is very good service and I really appreciate our waiter's hustle.

S"This place is absolutely amazing!  You can get every type of food known in all different cuisines.  They usually always have some type of carving stations open meaning beef (the beef during lunch is usually a skirt steak that is amazing at night it is usually prime rib and sometimes kobe beef.  The prime rib is usually quite good and the kobe is amazing.  They have a large vegetable station including my favorite glazed carrots.  \n\nThey have so many other types of foods it is hard to list them all.  A few tips, getting there at 3PM during lunch allows you to pay lunch prices before dinner starts (depending on the length of the line) but you get the best of both if you don't mind waiting for dinner stuff to come out.   This place is almost always busy but if you have Pearl status in MGM Grand's players club you get a line pass.  It is not terribly hard to get to Pearl status by just staying at the properties so look into it if you frequent this buffet the line pass is awesome.  And the Sunday brunch is quite amazing.  You get crab legs with the Sunday dinner but not much else so I would go at 330 on Sunday's again to get the brunch price with dinner foods. \n\nThe desserts for me were a mixed bag. They have a ton of different things to choose from and I am not a total desert person so for me I am more into simple things and they are much more exotic at this buffet so not bad by any means but if you prefer vanilla ice cream let's say you might be a bit disappointed in the deserts."

I have seen bigger buffets at 2 and 3 star hotels on the strip and off!\n\nI enjoyed the crab and the carrot cake, and everything tasted like "expensive" rather than rich and hearty. Thus, the quality of the food was not necessarily better but it was "superior" in the subjective high-end realm of taste. \n\nWas it worth $20 plus dollars for a smaller-selection dinner with fast service, long lines, expensive-tasting but not comfort-like food?

There was an omelette station, an asian station featuring curried duck, singapore noodles and some other choices (not really my choice for breakfast), a pizza station and much more.

I ate here this past Sunday around 7pm and to my surprise, I was able to walk all the way to the cashier without having to wait in line.\n\nI LOVE the food here. It's the only buffet that I am aware of that serves poke. They have both tuna and salmon poke and it is absolutely delicious!!!!!!!!! I also love the fact that they serve king crab here. Most of the buffets I go to serve snow crab, so it's not very often that I get to eat king crab. \n\nTable service is very prompt considering how busy this place gets. Dirty plates are picked up just about as soon as you are done with the plate and drink refills come around before you even finish your drink. \n\nThere is a carving station that I like, but sometimes it's a hit and miss. The prime rib is usually ok, although sometimes it was too overdone for my liking. There was kobe beef at the carving station during my last visit, but it was WAY to well done for my liking.

Still, I was willing to give them a pass on it until I ran into two other major problems:\n\n1) Some of the king crab legs were really salty, and others were really icy. You could taste the ice crystals. Both of these factors distracted from the anticipated heavenliness of the crab feast, so -1 star.\n\n2) The desserts were generally not that impressive. The cheesecake, tiramisu, chocolate cake thingy, and non-brulee portion of the creme brulee didn't taste right. While I eventually found several desserts that I enjoyed (the dark chocolate cone thing; the bananas foster, which seems like a flambe or just heated bananas with a sweet syrup that worked out; the peach sorbet and raspberry sorbet), I expected far better than hit-or-miss quality from this place.\n\nNow for some dishes that I would recommend if you choose to try this place: bass, seared bluenose fish with the dark sauce, leg of lamb, shrimp and pesto pizza, the pastas, and oh man, the shrimp cocktail was absolutely spectacular. Still, I expected more out of this place, so I'm only giving 3 stars."

S'We came to this buffet because it billed as the best buffet in town at the time.  We were extremely disappointed because all the food was at the wrong temperature.  The food that should be hot was only slightly warm and the food that should be cold was only slightly chilled.  The flavors would have been good if severed right and that only added to the disapointment,  We walked away wanting our money back and vowing never to return.'

S'What is the first thing that comes to mind when you\'re going to Vegas? \nGambling? Nah! \nCrazy Clubs? Nope! \nShows? No way! \nExcessive amounts of Alcohol? Mayb....NO! \nBuffet? PLEASE BELIEVE! \n\nThis was my first time getting to try the Bellagio\'s buffet so I was JUICED! We went for brunch and after looking at the prices, I noticed that the Champagne Brunch was around $27 plus tax. HOLLA! Not a bad price at all, right?!?! \n\nI\'m gonna break this down plate by plate - wish me luck! \n\nPlate 1: Breakfast-ish \nOmelet Station - So good!! They have all the standard fixins and you get to watch your dude flip them. \nEggs Benedict - They used sour dough English muffins which is always a plus in my book. Normally I don\'t like buffet eggs benedict but these were good even sitting out. \nChicken Sausage - I have no clue which brand they use but it was delish. I heart breakfast! \nScalloped Potatoes - they were cheesy! YUM! \n\nPlate 2: Confusion \nCheese Blitzes w/ berry toppings - I couldn\'t eat them. Maybe because it was more on the lunch side of brunch and they had been sitting out to long. The cheese just didn\'t settle right for me. \nBow Tie pasta with chicken and blue cheese type sauce - YUM! Bow Ties and Blue Cheese. love it \nAsparagus - all time favorite veggie! It wasn\'t even mushy. Nice job buffet guys. \nTurkey - Not gonna lie, it was kinda dry. When I make turkey, I inject it with broth and butter. LOL - COME SEE ME! \n\nPlate 3: Why did I need a plate 3? \nMoar Asparagus - Told you its my favorite! \nMashed Sweet Potatoes - They tasted good but nothing special. \nPrime Rib - Way over cooked. Prime Rib should be red, this was brown. \n\nPlate 4: "Dessert" \nMint Pea Soup - SO GOOD! This was the best thing I had all morning. \nFruit - LOL... tryna be healthy after eating way too much right? \n\nBrunch was good overall but I think I expected a little higher quality in the food. I think the price for brunch was great and there was a good selection of food. I also loved the fact my Mimosa glass was always full. \n\nIf I came for dinner I probably would have been a little more disappointed but brunch was good for what it was and the price was right.'

I am not a big fan of buffets as I can't ever eat enough to get my money's worth but Bellagio goes all out with their food. Top of the line Alaskan Crab legs, all sorts of meat, i.e., Kobe, Elk, Ostrich, etc. Everything is premium here."

S'Our last buffet in Vegas. We had brunch at the Wynn the day before, but the Bellagio didn\'t disappoint. Highlights were the "healthy" salad bar in the middle that had dried fruit and pre-made salads that were asian and mediterranean-inspired, grilled salmon, flank steak (SO GOOD), spaghetti squash, glazed carrots, and chicken. And all you can eat shrimp, of course. My friends loved the desserts too.'

S"Checked this place out on a Sunday afternoon.\n\nBe prepared for a super, super long line - I think we waited for a whole hour as our stomachs growled.  On the bright side, I was surrounded by slot machines which gave me something to do.  On the down side again....I was robbed of $15 to the slot machines.\n\nAfter an eternal hungry long hour, we finally made it to the cashier line.  $25ish bucks for Sunday brunch and unlimited champagne is an additional $5.  I opted for the champagne as drinking mimosas while stuffing ones face sounded like a pretty good plan.  \n\nWe were quite relieved to finally get inside and be seated.  From a visual standpoint, I somewhat expected a fancier buffet being that it was the Bellagio, but everything was pretty standard.  I cruised through - checking to see what goodies were up for grabs.  \n\nI saw:  prime rib, pizza, pasta, cocktail shrimp, around 4 selections of sushi, different variety of potatoes,  fish (no idea what kind since I don't fancy fish), spring rolls, miso soup, ham, turkey, Belgium waffles, scrambled eggs, cereal, oatmeal, etc.  Desserts included chocolate eclairs, flan, cheesecake, tarts, cookies, etc.    Overall the food quality was good+.  However; I had a hard time finding stuff that I actually wanted to eat.\n\nThe sushi selection was really boring and quality was OK.  If you're a sushi lover, you'll probably be disappointed with their brunch selection.  \n\nWe got in around 2 and ended up still being there by the time dinner rolled around (4pm).  Since we were too full, we couldn't take advantage of the dinner items.  It's probably a good strategy to come in late to pay the lunch rate to get the dinner selection.\n\nOverall, this place was OK.  While the quality was good+, I couldn't find foods that just wooed me.  I had to circle the buffet several times in order to fill my empty plate."

S'Not recommended for vegetarians. Seemed good for meat lovers. Go for lunch, not dinner (or pay for lunch and stay for dinner, like we did).\n\nThe food stations were messy, so they are obviously not designed well. Not what you expect at a "luxury" hotel. The dessert selection was impressive, but not that satisfying, and I tried almost everything. Golden Nugget had the best desserts of the buffets we\'ve been to, with less selection but better quality.\n\nGolden Nugget and Main Street Station were better for us (vegetarians, mostly vegan), and much cheaper. In the future (if we ever go to Vegas again, the place disgusts us on many levels) we\'ll stay and eat downtown. The Strip is definitely the place to see things, but for a good quality inexpensive meal, go downtown.\n\nOn a previous trip we went to Spice Market Buffet twice (2 consecutive nights) because it was so good, although pricey. That was back in December 2003.'

S'Some people go to Vegas to gamble, some go for the nightlife, but I go to eat. At just under $40, this buffet may seem a bit pricey, but it is well worth the cost as long as you eat the appropriate items (so stay away from the salad).\n\nThe variety is great, ranging from various types of sushi, seafood, meats, pastas, and even pizza! Sadly the pizza looked like the worst thing there, but why would you eat pizza at a buffet when you have prime rib, shrimp cocktail, and all the crab legs you could eat!\n\nDessert was even better, almost as much variety as the main dishes. Choose from frozen yogurt, sorbet, and more pastries than you could ever imagine.'

S'Now, this is a buffet.\n\nA few weeks ago, I took a trip to Las Vegas for a pharmacy conference, and was craving good quality food for good price. I was already sick of the outrageous prices of food in "fast food" places in the Venetian (having spent nearly 10 dollars on a coffee and a bagel), I was craving good quality food. A friend suggested we take advantage of the lunch prices before 4pm (making it a lunch-dinner pit stop), so I followed them to The Bellagio.\n\nWe paid around 25 bucks, and it was well worth it. There was SO MUCH SELECTION. The meats were great, from the Kobe steak, prime rib, bbq pork, and Mmmm, my fave of the night, BBQ ribs. Also, there was a huge selection of seafood, from the crab legs, shrimp, and all types of fish (sea bass, salmon, tuna, etcera). The fish itself was cooked a bit too much, so it was dry, but after eating the mussels, I was satisified. \n\nThey also had an ETHNIC section, with Chinese and Japanese food. I don\'t normally touch "Chinese" food at buffets, so I didn\'t this time, but saw they even carried duck! I tried the sushi bar they had.. they even had HAND ROLLS... which was an okay quality grade.. but man, for a buffet? it was pretty worth it.\n\nMy absolute favorite part of the buffet was the DESSERT. Yes, you\'re not going to find the best amazing desserts, but the SELECTION was insane. My fave was a hazelnut chocolate mousse cake and the carrot cake. There were cheesecakes, cookies, more cakes, ice cream, sorbet, lemon bars, eclairs, etcera. I had to get a coffee at the end to eat with all my desserts.\n\nService was good as well, as every time I got up, the waiter took my plate away. Also, he was good on keeping my drinks fully supplied, which I appreciated. I just raised my hand, and he came instantly. Good job on the service.\n\nI would have given this place 5 stars, based on the meat, but the seafood was not the greatest, nor the sushi. Nonetheless, probably one of the best buffets I\'ve been to! Next time, I\'ll go for brunch.'

(tsk tsk) prime rib had a lot of fat, so make sure to ask for a healthy portion/cut. dessert was plentiful, make your own ice cream with toppings. if you want sushi have them make it and tip the chef, but definitely stay away from the sushi that's already out, it's old, stale and just nasty."

S'I walked out of the buffet the fullest that I have ever been in my entire life. I happened to be wearing some really tight, constricting articles of clothing and ended up taking pieces off until I was down to my spaghetti strap (and jeans, I wasn\'t walking around pant-less). Not my proudest moment. \n\nThe Bellagio Buffet is definitely tasty and something to be experienced when you go to Vegas. The quality of the food is superior to a lot of other buffets and you can just taste it when you eat it. I was actually really surprised at how good the sushi they had was, especially the tuna poke salad. And their prime ribs & baby back ribs are delissssh. I wasn\'t a fan of the crab legs that they had out though. Snaps to them for cutting them for you already (because I\'m a baby & hate having to go through all that work for such little pay off) but it tasted incredibly salty to me. I\'ve had better. And I was a little disappointed by the desserts. They were tasty enough, but not nearly as good as they looked. No big though, everything else made up for it. \n\nJust a note, the wait is kind of long. And there\'s only like 3 stalls in the ladies restroom, so there\'s always a wait there too. Seriously? It\'s a buffet. You\'d think they\'d be sensitive to that, and to those that might want to "unload" before going for round 8. The service is great though- my drink was always filled, tables quickly cleared, and the waiter gave me some bomb green tea after to help digest. Also, as nice as the hotel itself may be, there\'s really no need to get dressed up for it as it isn\'t really a "nice" restaurant, in case anyone was wondering. I truly felt bad for the girls I saw dressed to impress teetering back and forth on their heels. Dress comfortably in loose clothing, stretchy pants not optional. :)'

So I went to Cafe Bellagio instead which was really good.\n\nFor the second try, I went at 10:30 am to stand in line for lunch. 'Only' waited 40 minutes.\n\nUnfortunately, I went to the Wynn Buffet the day before which made Bellagio Buffet look weak. The quality of food really isn't that great. It gives the impression of an upgraded (choice of food) Hometown Buffet. I'm sorry if it sounds harsh but in all honesty it really does.\n\nAlso you can tell by the people who come to eat here that for some things you really get what your money is worth. \n\nI'm not going to come back to Bellagio Buffet... sorry folks."

Do what I do and come right before 4pm (which is when lunch ends) and pay lunch prices. \nCheap I know..but I'm Asian.\n- Crab legs here are CRAZY salty.\n- One of my fav. was was the salmon & ahi poke. SUPERRR spicy but I kept going back for more.\n\nThis place is consistently solid and you won't be disappointed (unless you waited over 1 hr in line...then you'll just be mad).\nNot exactly worth the $40 dinner price..but if you can get in for cheaper than go for it!"

All the staff are smiling, friendly, and eager to serve you.  Excellent selection, and exquisit desserts.  \n\nIf I had any complaint at all it would only be that the prime rib at the carving station has always been under-cooked for my taste.

Lunch price is $10 cheaper on weekdays(Sun-Thur) and $17 cheaper on weekends(Fri-Sat) compared to dinner pricing.\n\nFood was good.  Kind of expected more but not a bad buffet.  \nSelection was good.\nNothing really stood out as amazing but I enjoyed the following:\n-st. louis style ribs\n-prime rib\n-quail\n-baked sea bass\n-buffalo popcorn shrimp\n\nDesserts were ok.  Pretty stuffed at this point so that probably affected the enjoyment factor.  Seemed like pretty standard buffet items (creme brulee, flan, cheesecake, fruit tarts, etc.)\n\nService was decent.

It was cheaper, the staff was nicer, and the food had better quality.\nFamily came in once it opened, paid upfront first, and we immediately got seats close to the food. Roughly 30 mins later, 12:30pm, the place was getting packed and there was a huge line outside. Definitely come here early! They have everything you can think of: sushi, pizza, prime rib, crab legs, salads, soups, sirloin, omelet station, I'm not even covering the best and most! It was super delicious! The waitresses were attentive and refilled the drinks even before it was half empty. If the entrees weren't enough, the dessert station was going to finish you off! Sorbets, chocolate cakes, key lime pie, pumpkin pie, ice cream, cookies, cheesecake, etc!\n\nJust try this place out for lunch, it's cheaper than the other guys and much better too!"

S'There was a time--back in the 1990\'s that the Bellagio Buffet was on top--a must visit when in Vegas.  I craved it.  The bronze and silver shined, the service was filled with energy and excitement, and the food--extraordinary.  I remember sitting down and just polishing off lots of carp and lox and salmon.  \n\nBut those days are no more--and they have gone been since the crash of the economy in 2008--this Buffet has never come back.\n\nOn my last visit, which will be my last--the bronze and silver was worn and did not shine, the service was dull and angry, and the food mediocre.  Gone was the great quality Lox and Carp and Salmon.  It reminded me of a Buffet that was headed toward Circus Circus level.  \n\nBut people keep lining up--because it\'s 1990\'s strong reputation lives on with people that never experienced how great it used to be.  They accept mediocrity because they never knew superiority.  Chicago Grandma tells her 20 something grandkids, "don\'t forget to check out the Bellagio Buffet, it\'s the best in Vegas..."  But grandma has not been there since Millenium New Years Eve in 1999.  \n\nThere are others that have those great memories of the 1990\'s at this Buffet, know that it is no more, but keeping checking-in hoping that it comes back, only to leave disappointmented. \n\nThis buffet has no incentive to improve because people line up like cattle for the slaughter not knowing any better--just what they heard.  And if they can keep filling the seats without improving--it\'s a cash cow for the casino--it may make more money than some of the tables many nights.  \n\nIt\'s depressing to see what it has become.\n\nYou\'re meal here will be OK, you will walk away full and satisfied--but there is much better for your dining dollar folks I hate to tell you.'

It was blend, but eatable. \n\nThey even had Alaskan King Crab Legs, which is the most expensive crab legs out there. I spent most of my time, eating the King Crab legs and not the Snow crab legs since you can find snow crab legs for dinner at every buffet in Vegas.\n\nI didn\'t get any sushi, but man, the lines were looong to get some made to order sushi roll.\n\nDeserts were abundant. They even have Macarons. I saw one diner got a whole plateful of Macarons, I\'m assuming they going to stuff that into their purse to take home.\n\nService was good.

The sushi was great, the Beef wellington was fantastic and it was hard to choose which of the many desserts to indulge on.  The wait staff we had was fantastic and even made me chocolate milk!"

S'We stayed next door to the Bellagio and decided to try out their buffet after a long Internet search on "who has the best buffer in Vegas". Our wait in line was bearable, but you can definitely find yourself in a long line, especially for breakfast and dinner times. This is supposed to be the best buffet in Vegas. I can say that the food quality is top notch and you don\'t feel ripped off after paying 50 or so dollars per person. it offers a massive and wide array of food options...it\'s like you died and went to Vegas food heaven. Good food and experience!'

Various cakes and sweets were available. From carrot cake to bananas foster. If you love red meat make sure to come for dinner. Endless prime rib, lamb, Kobe beef etc. Sushi selections were numerous.

S"Let me start by saying: Oh. My. God. I've never stood in line for one and a half hours for dinner before.\n\nMoving on... My boyfriend is not a fan of buffets, but hearing that their Gourmet Dinner has Kobe beef, he was willing to try. The steak was very good for buffet standards (although for $40 you'd expect them to be good), you can choose medium rare or well-done, we had the medium rare and it was tender and juicy. The lamb was good too, but the taste is very strong, I was overwhelmed by the second slice. They also serve regular steaks and wellingtons.\n\nThe Mac & Cheese is AWFUL, totally tasteless. I tried a few pieces of each of their pastas and none of them tasted memorable. I went around a whole circle of the place and took a spoonful of most of the dishes they were serving and nothing really stood out to me (other than the various steaks).\n\nNow, we must talk about desserts. Why? Because I love them, if you don't, you can skip ahead.\nCheesecake - oh so very good. It melts in your mouth and the flavor is so rich but at the same time it isn't overwhelming at all. Must try!\nCarrot cake - standard, flavorful and not too much icing.\nTarts - there are various different tarts but I didn't quite like them. The Lime Tart is super sour.\nTiramisu - it tasted more like coffee mousse to me, but it's not bad.\nChocolate cake - very good! The chocolate flavor is very rich.\nCaramel Pudding - the pudding was lacking taste, the caramel sauce couldn't really save it either.\n\nAll in all, I'm not sure we'd go back when we visit Vegas again (mainly due to the unimaginably long lines), but if you're a steak and dessert lover, this is a good place to go!"

S"I avoid buffets like the plague. When two of my friends where raving about the dinner they had there before the rest of us arrived, and convinced everyone to go eat there; I broke out in a cold sweat and was having flashbacks to my youth and being dragged to countless Chinese and old country buffets where I would get yelled at my mother for wasting her ten bucks, as I could only bring myself to eat their canned fruit and ice cream and nothing else. \n\nSilly me didn't realize that this is Vegas and they do things a bit differently here. Where should I start. The sushi, yes I ate sushi at a buffet and it was awesome. The hazelnut french toast with banana was glorious. The countless amounts of fresh fruit, the salmon which I had to restrain myself from taking all of it. Everything I put on my plates was so good. \n\nEveryone loved the food and I'm told the desserts were so good as well, I didn't trust myself to just have a few so I passed. The buffet is maintained well and so there is nothing sitting out there forever. Expect a bit of wait but its well worth it. We were there July fourth weekend so they hiked up their prices a little bit, so expect that if you there during a holiday. \n\nThe Bellagio has changed my opinions on buffets, when I go back to Vegas I'm making a stop here, and may even try some other places."

They make the yummiest omelettes (lots of different ingredients to choose from including crab and shrimp - mMM...).  I also like that their shrimps are really fresh and huge as well.  Their crab legs are already halved so all it makes eating them super easy.  Their sushi is pretty good as well and they make a mean spicy tuna hand roll.  The quality of their food definitely beats all the other buffets I've been too (including the Wynn buffet).\n\nBest part about the Bellagio buffet?  Their desserts of course!  They offer so many decadent treats...there's bound to be something for everyone ;)\n\nOnly bad part is that the wait is usually 1.5 hours but it's so worth it when you're finally in there surrounded by all the yummy foods they have to offer.

S'30 bucks for dinner on a Monday evening. Tons of food, over the top! They have a little bit of everything. My highlights were: the meat carving area, (mmm prime rib was delicious!) the pre mixed salads were tasty and fresh, (citrusy chicken orange and nut salad!) lots of dessert selection (i had creme brule and yuumy meringue) \nand you MUST try the pesto mashed potatoes. I think that was one of my favorite things there!!\nLowlights: the sushi had kind of a dry flilm on top like it had been sitting out way too long and not much selection. Also I would like them to offer crab legs in more than one spot, there was a 5-7 person line at all times for the 1 single tray of crab legs.'

S"Yep, still five. I gotta agree with Jack F., this one definitely stretched the breadbox. I had to take it in sections and still didn't make it all the way through. I did almost die though, but thanks to our comfy booth, I could lay down while I recouped. Yeah, we came on the weekend this time, so we paid $37 with taxes, but I'll tell you what, this was not a buffet. More like gourmet sampling. \n     My first plate included, Beef Wellington, Prime Rib, Rack of Lamb, and Pan Seared Venison, among other things. The lamb was amazing as was the wellington. The prime rib was underseasoned, but cooked well, while I needed a band-aid for the venison as it wouldn't stop bleeding. It was not seasoned well, and I think bambi was still fighting for his last breath, because he seemed to be pulsating a bit. \n     Bambi aside, i also tried three different versions of veal, all of which were very good, if a bit light on the seasoning. The raw fish was where it was at. The salmon and ahi pokes were amazing! They also had a delicious spicy tuna handroll. As for the cooked fish, the swordfish was alright, while the chilean seabass melts in your mouth, not in your hand. Why would you have it in your hand anyway, this belong in your mouth. Or better yet, in my belly...all of it. Get in my belly! The Italian offerings were pedestrian, but good. \n     The dessert was pretty good as well with offerings ranging from delicious creme brulee to peach cobler, bread pudding, delicious bananas foster, and a meh flan. The service kinda sucked, but we weren't waiting for them. We were too busy stuffing ourselves retarded. they deserve all five desipte the price, but it you come on the week days you only pay $27.

S"I'm going to come out and say it, the buffet isn't all that. It's certainly not worth it. At least not these days. Maybe back when it was new and all that, but like fish sitting out, the moment it gets old it's not worth eating and should be tossed out. \n\nSo it's really confusing as to why there's so many people lining up to this thing daily. And while I'm a huge fan of seafood, especially when you have it in Vegas where they ship in thousands upon thousands of tons of fresh fish daily, you would expect to actually find something good here. \n\nWhat you end up with is just over hyped buffet food that isn't worth the lines you're waiting in, nor the coin you're dropping to get in. \n\nMaybe it's just that I'm over the buffet scene. The younger me would have been all over this. In fact, I was. Back in my early 20's I would come here a lot when I came to Vegas and stuff myself with all this seafood and feel incredibility sick for the rest of the day. \n\nBut in the many years since I've come to realize that while I'm paying for quantity, the quality sure has suffered. And really, for the amount you're paying to get in here, you're just losing yourself in the moment of trying to make the plates add up to the amount. \n\nYou're better off just going to a nice sit down restaurant that is highly rated and has a specialty you like and enjoy the meal without feeling like you're in the rush to make your dollar count. \n\nYou'll certainly bypass the awful lines to get in, as well as not deal with every tourist who was told they had to come to the Bellagio Buffet."

I went for the unlimited champagne brunch, which cost about $30 -  only $6 more than the regular brunch.\n\nMy eyes are always much bigger than my stomach at buffets, but by now I've learned to work out a system that is the least wasteful. Check out all the food first, go for proteins and take small portions, stay away from carbs as much as possible, and then save the most room for dessert!\n\nThe food at the dinner buffet is definitely much better than brunch, but you also pay a lot more. Brunch is good, but nothing is really spectacular. The beef tenderloin, spicy tuna hand rolls with spicy sweet sauce, and leg of lamb were my favorites. The desserts were the best part - the cheesecake and carrot cake are delectable! \n\nMy mimosa came in a large wine glass, which is smart on their end because they don't have to come around pouring as much. I actually only managed to drink one glass, which turned out to be just enough. If we had stayed there for a couple hours, I'm sure I would've had another glass or two.\n\nIf you only have time to do one buffet during your stay, I'd recommend The Buffet at Wynn instead.

Nonetheless, having the tiny tummy that I do, all it took was 4 rounds before I could hardly get up anymore and I will say, I was contented.\n\nMy parents and I decided to spice up family day by trying out the buffet at the Aria but when we got there, we were told it was under renovation so we diverted our route to plan B and that was either Bellagio or Wynn. Seeing as Bellagio was not too far away, we settled here for lunch. At 12:30pm, there were hardly any lines and we were seated almost right away at our table. I was almost completely aware that our server seemed very very tired. Thankfully, he ended his shift not too long after we arrived and Victor took over for the rest of our dining experience. \n\nChanging gears for a second, the food made its mark on my family. 5 Cheese Tortellini in Pesto held a special place on my plate almost every time I went back. There was sushi, a variety of cheese, cold cuts, cous cous, salads and fresh vegetable rolls (please avoid these) for appetizers and plenty more. An array of main course options included pineapple fried rice (it had an exotic touch to it which I loved), beef flank, jumbo shrimp cocktail, pizza, pastas. I have to say though, that the dessert didn't really live up to my expectations. I was hoping they'd have more ice-cream options but instead, they only offered chocolate, vanilla and a couple of sorbets. No creme brulee or macarons like I wished. \n\nNOTE that they boot up the dishes for dinner (king crab in the house!) at 3:30pm so take your time with lunch and just wait till the hour strikes and feast upon the magical extras! Our server, Victor, was more than entertaining and after noticing how much I loved dessert (and at that point, couldn't quite get up to grab any more), he brought me and my mom some tiramisu and raspberry cheesecake shooters which were the bomb! I am absolutely thankful for his pleasant service and how he would occasionally drop by our table to joke around with my dad. \n\nKeep this buffet on top of your list, but place it up number 3 or 4 for back-up!"

S'This place is overrated and hyped up too much. Many of your friends will hype it up so much and so well, saying "YOU HAVE" to go here. Of course you listen and after your finished you realize, damn, it wasn\'t worth $30. \n\nMost of that high price probably comes from being in the Bellagio. $20 would suffice for the quality of food and selection. \n\nThe ambiance of the Bellagio IMO really is non existent after the hallway where the line forms to the cashier. Then it gets toned down. With the way people talk and tell me about the place, I was expecting super duper extravagant. \n\nThe desserts were really nice, but same affair over at Luxor and is significantly cheaper. \n\nThe crab legs were big and plentiful. Eat a lot of this if you want to get what you paid for. Japanese/Sushi station was a joke. The California rolls were average at that, seeing better at Todai. The other entries were above your average buffet, which was nice, and which was expected at the price and location. Some entries that included truffles, and welington in the name is always an eye opener. They also had some good pizza. Salad bar is a salad bar, and I did not want to waste my stomach space for that at a $30 buffet. \n\nThis place gets very busy, and the bus boys are prompt with your drinks and clean up of old plates. \n\nI really don\'t have anything else to say. I would eat here again, it is a nice buffet no doubt, but way overrated and hyped up. If this is your first time in Vegas and this is your first time at a buffet in Vegas, of course it\'s almost positive and high marks. But after the initial excitement, you will realize there are better or equal for cheaper.\n\nI don\'t think the location and hotel attraction should play into the review of this buffet. If it is, that is saying something about the food and choices. I see reviews saying the samething I\'m saying and they are still giving it 4-5 stars. Why?'

S"Ok....I make it a habit to eat buffet once everytime I am in town.  This is one of the best buffets in Vegas (along with the one at Wynn for $38).\n\nI would give Bellagio the slight edge over Wynn because their desert station is far superior (although I am not into sweets).\n\nKing Crabs Legs, Prime rib, rack of lamb.....that is all I need to be happy.  However, I can only do one buffet when I am in town.  Take your pick: Bellagio or Wynn....you can't go wrong with either one."

S'I was on a mission that night. My eye was on the prize. If I was going to spend $30 on a buffet, I was going to bring out the big guns. I saw what I had expected. Various steaks and fancier meats, assorted pasta dishes, sushi, but then something caught the corner of my eye. I lurked forward, skeptical, pondering if I had witnessed the "real deal." As I got closer, the excitement built until I knew for sure what I had found. The mother of all finds. Something that I had never eaten at a buffet before...\n\nALASKAN KING CRAB\n\nI could barely contain myself. There were a few people in front of me who were taking their sweet time picking up those deliciously huge crab legs and I gave them my evilest eye. Finally, I had made it to the front and started to pile my plate with crab legs. \n\nIt was glorious. The crab legs were already cracked in half for you, so you didn\'t have to work to get your crab meat. It was instant gratification that I had never felt while eating crab. I really liked it. The huge downside were that the legs were cold, but you can\'t always win.\n\nI calculated that around my 3rd plate of crabs, that I was near getting my money\'s worth. So, I decided to venture off and try some of the other items. The prime rib was dry and the chicken wellington really didn\'t impress me. I went back to the crab legs.\n\nThat being said, the experience was worth it. Vegas buffet\'s really did meet my expectations and I\'m anxious to try the others as well.'

S"I was expecting great things of this buffet, it's apparently one of the best in Vegas. We stood in while for 20 minutes before they relieved us of a suitable amount of money and we were shown to our table. Our waitress had a little bit of an attitude issue as she refused to get our drinks order until we were all at the table. God forbid she'd have to make two trips to our table with drinks!\n\nThe selection in my opinion was poor and nothing like what I was expecting. All of the food was actually pretty uninspiring, nothing really springs to mind as exceptional. Average and not worth the money.\n\nAs we felt the service was poor we didn't leave a tip, however our waitress reminded us we should leave a tip. Very cheeky."

S'Meh.  We waited in line for about an hour for a pretty average Vegas buffet, despite its inclusion on most "Best of" lists for the category.  Nothing was particularly special or delicious, the selection wasn\'t outrageous, and they weren\'t able to keep up with demand on many items, causing long lines.  Our server couldn\'t be bothered to check on us more often than every twenty minutes or so, and dirty dishes piled up on our table frequently.  The decor was nothing special.  And to top it all off, this was supposed to be a more special menu offering than normal; they were charging $100 for two, since they stretched "Mother\'s Day" pricing out over three days.  Really a disappointment.  I don\'t know if this used to be good, but it\'s extremely average now, even at the "normal" $30 price point for dinner.  With all the options in Vegas, Buffet and otherwise, I won\'t be back.'

S"2 stars for good eggs and bacon. Except that I paid $30 for eggs and bacon. Semi rude employees that don't speak English. Quinoa salad and all other salads were either stale, dry or simply inedible. Everyone at the table spit out and left their salads untouched. Very few options. The chinese station only offered rice and shrimp dumplings that tasted old and dry and we could not eat more than a bite. The pizza was greasy and lacked any flavor. On par with any fast food pizza.  My friend said the sushi tasted like grocery store sushi (dry chewy rice, cheap seaweed, fishy and minimal fish). So at this point pretty much ALL the food was disgusting so we all decided to eat eggs and bacon at 1pm. They were very good. But I could have gotten good eggs and bacon at any other restaurant for $16. The desserts were bitter and dry. This place SUCKS"

We weren't seated until almost 1:30 PM.   It wraps a few times, so we took turns waiting in line while the others went and gambled.  Needless to say, we wasted no time getting food. \n\nThe price is reasonable at $25.  \n\nThe food is good,  but not like OMG.  There is a massive amount of selection ranging from sushi rolls, pizza, prime rib, lamb, fish, breakfast items, asian,  and lots more goodies.   The dessert selection was good.  I ate chocolate covered strawberries and flan.  Both were outstanding.  \n\nIt is alot of food.  I would say the Wynn buffet is better though."

S"I've been to the Bellagio Buffet a few times, and it's always been good.  However, visiting over Thanksgiving this year and taking in the Buffet I found it even better, and easily the best Buffet I've enjoyed in Las Vegas.\n\nFrom the diverse foods (Venison, Ostrich, Kobe Top Sirlion, Sushi) to the Buffet staples (Crab Legs, Prime Rib) and the holiday offerings (Turkey, stuffing, etc), it was all amazing this time around.  The salad and veggies offerings were also exceptional, and I was pleased that that dessert serving sizes were small as I felt much better about sampling just a bite or two of a few different things (and if you really want to gorge, you can always take a few).\n\nThere are certainly cheaper buffets in the area, and some very good ones that are cheaper too... but for the overall quality and variety this is still a pretty good value (you could easily spend more than this having a salid and a main course at the cafe in Bellagio)."

I highly recommend doing this so you can experience double the food.\n\nI really enjoyed the breakfast - a really great variety of food. Tons of fruit, and some more unusual offerings too, such as breakfast pizza and 'congee' (which is Chinese rice porridge).  For the congee, add some miso soup & dried pork 'floss' (what an unfortunate name) to it! -- delicious."

Not only was our waiter unattentive, the lead hostess was making snide remarks about guests, and when we needed service & asked for help from other servers they simply said "we cannot help you, that\'s not our section".

S'So, since 40 Gabillion other people have already reviewed this buffet, I\'ll just go into my faves / disappointments very quickly.\n\nI think I expected something more, based on all the hype and hooplah.  But the Bellagio Buffet, in all its\' glory, is still a BUFFET.  I don\'t know why I expected other, but I did.  That being said, it\'s a darn good buffet, with options that are not only not found at other buffets, but that a lot of people wouldn\'t get the chance to try elsewhere. (I doubt they serve Bluenose and Kobe Beef in, like, Iowa or whatever.)\n\n*****TIP*****  We arrived 15 minuted before the end of lunch / beginning of dinner.  We paid the lunch price, but feasted on the dinner goodies.  Just plan to spend 2+ hours.  It\'s fun to do this when you go with a group and can pass the time with a few drinks and some good conversation.\n\nThe Not-So-Much:   \nI was SO unimpressed with their desserts.  I know I\'m in the minority here, but we grabbed a Flan, which was inedible, a Chocolate Mousse Cake with Hazelnuts (weak flavor) and a Lemon bar of some sort.  That was the best of the bunch, and even it was meh.\nAlso: The lamb was overcooked and chewey. (We like it rare, it was medium.)\nThe Crab Legs:  They were like sponges, you could squeeze the water out of them. Gross.\n\nThe Interesting:\nRoast Quail\nBluenose (Very similar to Seabass. See the "Awesome" seciton.)\n\nThe Good:\nScallop Ceviche.\nSeaweed Salad.\nFresh Mozarella Pesto.\nKobe Beef Sirloin (Flavorful but not tender.)\n\nThe Awesome:\nMashed Sweet Potatoes (With Ginger and Orange)\nBluenose (They prepared it in various ways.  I had 3 helpings!)\nHouse-Cured Bacon (Think Smoked Pork Belly!  YUM!)\nSmoked Trout (It was amazing.)\nSalmon Nigiri (It was REALLY good. Definitely NOT Buffet Sushi Quality.)\n\n\nIt was overall an impressive spread.  But the price is high, and it wasn\'t the supreme perfection that would make me not want to experience the Wynn, Carnival @ Rio, or Cravings @ the Mirage.'

S"This place was legit. It was definitely not as pricey as I thought it was going to be given that it is in the Bellagio Hotel. Regardless, I paid $35 for brunch including the $5 unlimited champagne. And let me tell you...it's good champagne and you don't have to stick to just mimosas. You can try it with grapefruit juice, cranberry juice, etc etc. Possibilities are endless! Not to mention the waiter topped us off every time he'd pass by our table.\n\nAnd the food was to die for. Everything from the eggs to the fish to the prime rib and potatoes is definitely worth trying. Come with an empty stomach and you will leave satisfied. We ate at 1pm and I did not eat anything for the rest of the day...I was THAT stuffed. Definitely try the pizzas, prime rib, and eggs benedict. The sushi I would not recommend; the selection was ok and the line got way too crazy.\n\nAnd then there are the desserts. There is a wide selection and everything is pretty much bite-sized so you can essentially try every single one. And then of course there are fruits and muffins and croissants and etc etc. \n\nOverall, definitely one of the best buffets in Vegas. I did not give it 5 stars because I expected more variety in the pasta/steak sections and the sushi was a let-down."

S"Wow this was a tough place to review. I was in Vegas with my lady and decided that I wanted to eat one night at a nice buffet on the strip. I have tried many, including the ones at the Rio, Luxor, Ecalibur, and MGM so I went online and Goggled top Las Vegas Buffets. Many lists ranked the Bellagio as numero uno so I decided to give it a try. I admit they had some good dishes, but far from being number 1 in my opinion. \n\nI am going to do the math so everyone can see how I got to my 3 star rating. \n\nBad: \n\n1. Crab legs were extremely dry and salty. \n2. Asian food had very few choices and the sushi tasted no better then grocery store deli sushi. \n3. Specialty salads had to be served by a person and came in little bowls, so really hard to sample all of them. \n4. Over all selections of food was small, unusual for a large buffet. \n5. Most importantly EVERYTHING WAS SALTY!!!!!! \n\nGood: \n\n1. Service was very good. \n2. Other then the saltiness of it you could tell the the food was high quality. Not opened from a can or jar. I tried some Asian noodles that were some of the best I had had. \n3. The crab legs were already cracked!!!!! Wow that was a huge plus, made it easier to eat them when you didn't have to work.....just sad that they were so salty and dry. \n4. A major plus that helped get this place back to 3 stars was the deserts. Very good selection and they were awesome. I almost at one point thought that they were good enough to come one night and just eat sweets. \n\nWith all of that said, will I return....no, I am sure there are much better places out there to try. Next I will try the Wynn."

S'Not sure what the big deal is.... if you live in a mid-size US city, your city should have some kind of buffet joint better than this one. \n\nWe went for the holiday brunch so I am not sure whether dinner will be better ($10 more expensive).\n\nFood\n\n- Juice is fresh and good, similar to Tropicana from super market. \n\n- Fruit is the highlight, they are all very fresh, probably because their buffet volume is very high. \n\n- Seafood: the crab legs are crap. Thin, small, salty, and they are still frozen. The shrimp with cocktail sauce, on the other hand, is of very decent size and freshness. \n\n- Pizza and pasta: tried a bit of each. They are decent tasting, just a tad better than the Papa Johns and Olive Gardens of your city. \n\n- Prime rib: extremely so so. No flavour and overcooked. No idea what people are talking about when they say "juicy and best prime rib I\'ve eaten"... any neighborhood steakhouse should do it better.\n\n- Hot dish: there are none. Seriously... no catfish fillet, no grilled salmon, no wok fried beef.... no hot dish at all. \n\nOverall, 2 stars for me. I ate some fruits which made me happy - it\'s hard to get fresh fruits in Vegas restaurants. The only way I think it is remotely worth of going back is if the price is around $25 and there is no wait.'

S'I ate here for brunch on Sunday. The wait wasn\'t short (around 45 mins) but if you\'ve ever been to Boiling Crab, you won\'t worry about the line.\n\n$25 for regular brunch/lunch or $30 to add champagne, which isn\'t bad at all.\n\nI wouldn\'t recommend eating any carbs here - french toast, waffles, bread, cheese blintz etc. No, not even the banana stuffed french toast. They\'re all so meh - like i\'m sure you could make better ones yourself. The custom omelets were fine but they definitely overdo the cheese. Skip the breakfast sausage - they look delectable but they\'re so tough and very dry (sad panda). Regular bacon was solid though.\n\nDefinitely go for the fish (Bluenose and Salmon) and any of the hand-carved meats (Prime Rib, Hand-Carved Bacon). Don\'t bother with the Green Curry Duck, though - looks disgusting and no taste whatsoever. Breakfast sausage was terrible and dry. The spicy tuna hand rolls were tasty. Desserts are typical buffet quality with the chocolate eclair being the standout.\n\nCouldn\'t tell you about the salad - that\'s what we Asians call, "a waste of money and stomach space." if you\'re going to a buffet, keep your eye on the prize, don\'t \'rest your stomach\' for too long and hold your bread, rice and pasta until the end. Remember, you\'re there for the meat and seafood (aka: the expensive stuff). Vaya con dios.'

S"At the weekday prices, this buffet is as good as it gets.  I probably would give it a 4 if I had to pay weekend prices. \n\nWe went here for late lunch on a Tuesday. I suppose if we'd stayed another half hour after we finished our meal we could have gotten some of the dinner food as well, but to be honest I was so incredibly full at that point that I couldn't eat another bite.  In fact, I stayed full until late the  next morning.  And I didn't even get to a number of things this place had to offer. \n\nBy far the most impressive part of the buffet was the multitude of fish courses (both cold and hot) and the sushi bar that included hand rolls.  The sushi for lunch was generally standard, but the hand rolls and spring rolls were really delicious. There were at least five different types of cooked fish courses, all executed remarkably well for a buffet. Other favorites were the sweet potato puree (pure heaven) and the creamy polenta. The sliders were surprisingly excellent, although the lamb and flank steak I tried were nothing special.  The cooked vegetables at this buffet are executed really well.  Not mushy or dried out.  The green beans and grilled asparagus were particularly good. Even the pizza here was decent and everyone knows how bad pizza can get at a buffet! \n\nThe only thing that was a bit disappointing here (and only a bit) were the desserts.  I have definitely had better desserts at a buffet before.  For the most part they were really your standard mini desserts with not much flavor.  But even here there were a couple of excellent standouts.  The bread pudding was delicious (and bread pudding can be really dry) and the pumpkin cheesecake was amazing.  \n\nMy husband was really impressed especially since it was under $20.  A good thing since it was his special birthday meal!"

What is there to relieve your tired, achy body and hungry belly? Buffets! Everywhere! Steak and eggs for $2, hot dogs for .75 or if you want to go high class, the Bellagio. \n\nA Bellagio breakfast/brunch will last you all day. It's only because I can gorge myself like nobody's business I can sustain a day in Vegas on breakfast pizza, eggs and potatoes alone. \n\nI had the dinner one last year while in Vegas and was not that impressed. Although I'm poor, we splurged for the breakfast two days in a row. TWO! The second day they sat us right by the plates as J. mentioned. Too easy, people. Just too easy to eat three meals in one sitting.\n\nThe breakfast pizza was my favorite. I had a mimosa, ate my weight in bacon and was introduced to the bread pudding. Whew! I was glad I spent the next 6 hours walking my ass off in the cold. \n\nCoffee and juice are complimentary, which is nice.

S'My wife, children and myself went here last July on a Sunday for lunch which ended us being Sunday Brunch. We waited in line an hour to pay and when we got to the register the cost was more then their online advertised price on the website. We asked for management and they were reluctant to give a price adjustment but in the end they gave us an offer that made up for the difficulty. I will say they have an online advertised price of 20.99 for lunch "daily" it\'s not daily, it\'s only Mon-Fri. The online advertised price for weekend brunch is $27.99 and the price at the register is $31.99. We came at 1pm. We were hoping for more of a lunch but there was more of a breakfast- brunch variety. There were at least 4 eggs, bacon and sausage stations which I thought was a bit much... There were two omelette stations which were good, and there was a carving station with turkey and prime rib. The prime rib was very rare, the turkey was delicious. It was difficult to find someone to carve as the only person in the area was manning the omelets. There was no powdered sugar for the French toast the whole time we were there the bowl remained empty... But the French toast was good without it and the syrup was nice and warm.  If you like sushi or Asian food there was a nice selection of fresh rolls and such... The desserts were beautifully presented and tasted delicious. Overall it is one of the better buffets, next time we come to Vegas we will do the dinner buffet as we really didn\'t want breakfast at 1pm.'

S"This buffet goes head to head with the Wynn's buffet for the best in Vegas. I pick the Bellagio over the Wynn every single time and I'll tell you why-- THE WAIT IS SHORTER.\n\nHonestly, when it gets to the fancy $40 per person buffets, the food is pretty much the same. You get all the gourmet meats, all the gourmet desserts, and excellent service. To get anything else would be business suicide especially when you're catering to supposedly rich clientale.\n\nThe difference is the wait. The Bellagio used to be excruciating before the Wynn opened but it's manageable unless you come 7pm on the dot. Then I will laugh at you. That's like coming to the DMV after everyone's off work.\n\nThere is something for everyone at this buffet and it's good breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\n\nOne cute trick my brother figured out is if you come in towards the end of lunch and pay the lunch price, they will switch to dinner with the dinner foods. Thus, you can get dinner for the price of lunch. I'm not sure if they close down the buffet during this period, it's been a few months since I last visited."

S'OK, so I know that this is definitely not your "buck ninety nine steak, eggs, & chop suey" buffets, but it\'s not worth $37 bucks.  \r\n\r\nI ate here about three days after getting back from my first trip to India.  After six months of finding God in the Ganges, I chose to make the terrible mistake of taking my blissfully post-ashram enlightened butt to an expensive buffet in Vegas.  Hell-o Culture Shock.\r\n\r\nIt starts out with a long line.  I was used to this, put people here actually make a line.  I has already ready to yell at someone for jumping the line, but no such American luck.  People scrambled like hungry busy bees to get as much food on the tables as possible.  \r\n\r\nMind you, the table for two at this establishment was, at a normal restaurant, a table for four.  I was with two other people, so our table was a sixer.  Our cokes were Oktoberfest size.  \r\n\r\nI walked around and saw a couple with what looked like a mountain of crab legs, maybe 6-7 plates full.  Gross.   I did manage to try a little of this and that.  Not memorable as far as quality of food goes.  I couldn\'t help but watch the train wreck of mass consumption.  Since I was just off the jet from a country where some quite suffer over lack, I found the experience appetite extinguishing.'

S"We went there on a Wednesday night, and not only did we have to wait over an hour in line, but they didn't have too many main-course vegetarian options, like tofu, veggie meat, loafs, etc. And a vegan definitely couldn't eat there, cause they'd have just fruit. Much of it was meat & side dishes to go along with the meat. I don't think i'd pay $36 again to eat overly-rich pasta, pizza & dessert, as a vegetarian. I probably ate about $5 worth of food, if that. The food was nicely presented though, and the staff friendly. They can't accommodate so many people in a timely manner. It's like a circus. I wouldn't go back because it's expensive, food options are limited for vegetarians, & takes WAY too long to get in."

S'The only part of the Bellagio buffet that is worth going to is the champaign brunch. It is a bit pricey, but is one of the best brunches I\'ve ever had and is worth checking out.\n\nThe rest of the buffet options (especially the "gourmet" dinner) are over priced setups for college cafeteria quality food.\nThe fish was dry, the meat was tough, and the vegetables tasted like they were out of a can.\nThe service was also unfriendly and the atmosphere was very cold.\n\nI would recommend going for the champaign brunch, but avoid everything else - there is better quality for better price at other locations.'

I think I made a total of six trips, 3rd servings of entrees, couple helpings of dessert here and there, tried the congee and some other stuff. I was disappointed that there was no seafood but maybe I came at the wrong time. I was pleased but life is too short to go to the same buffet in Las Vegas, so I'm not sure if I'll return."

S'Food is wonderful!  But service isn\'t.  We requested a larger table since we had a party of 7. Nancy seated us to a table put together that consisted of a table of 4 and 2. That put 3 at each side and one at the end. We paid good money for dinner so we wanted to be at a comfortable table with room. When we asked to put another table for 2 onto our table Nancy said " we seat 7 here all the time and it fits". When we insisted,  she finally gave in with dirty looks, and I saw her mumble something as she walked away. Our server Miguel also seemed like he wasn\'t in a good mood, but at least he didn\'t argue with us.

S"Very very good lunch buffet.  It probably doesn't top the Wynn for lunch but it is  cheaper too so you got to scale things appropriately.  The highlight items of the meal were the raspberry chocolate mousse, steamed clams, and a fabulous variety of fish (even better than what was offered at the Wynn for dinner buffet).  The fish I tried included salmon, tuna, african bluenose, wahoo, steamed halibut, and chilean seabass!!!!  My favorites were the streamed halibut and the chilean seabass...they flaked off very easily and the chilean seabass has a nice natural oily texture..delicious!!!!\n\nThe cut meat like turkey, 7 spice lamb leg,  beef flank, and chicken were just average.  Still, a very great buffet.   I ate so much that I got dizzy and had to rest at the table...but it was worth it.  =)"

Occasional as in, at least once every other year. Came this past week for an early birthday celebration for my dad. We stayed in Bellagio and dined at this buffet twice this trip. And there is always a line!\n\nSo here is my TIP: Get a MLife card people! Once you reached past the beginners card, you can skip the long line at the buffets and go to the front. It probably saved us hours (no exaggeration). You also receive points on your card when you dine here (make sure you give it to them to slide).\n\nWeekday lunch review: Used the Mlife card to bypass the long line. Super crowded. I would come before 11AM since it would be considered breakfast time and stay for both. There is a omelette service station with crab legs, shrimps as options. Eggs Benedict, salads, pizza, cocktail shrimps, carbs (pasta, bread, bagels), desserts (same as dinner), ice cream, sushi (few options), soups.\n\nWeekday dinner review: Snow crab and king crab legs!! Prime rib (overcooked), ham (salty), rack of ribs (not bad), forgot what type of beef they had at the craving station but it was good, cockshrimps, pizza (why would you..), salad, 5 types of soups, dessert, ice cream machine, sushi, fruits, pasta, lots of fish, tuna and salmon poki. I had a food baby that night. As I recall from trips before, the Wicked Spoon had better options for desserts. Dessert isn't the best here nor special. Overall it's a good buffet though."

S"Seriously, what is going on with all of the Vegas Buffets?  Almost all of them have gone downhill.  Needless to say, Bellagio's buffet is not is as good as it used to be.  At $60 per person, it doesn't even equate to a good value compared to eating at some of the finer dining establishments. But, the buffet here is still one of the better ones around in terms of quality and freshness.  As more and more buffets go over the top, Bellagio's seems to be a bit outdated.\n\njust be wary of the fact that the prices can jump depending on the day and season.  Normally it should have been $30, but it was double that for dinner when we went.  There is still a good selection and the carving stations are always decent, with roasted chicken, turkey breast, or prime rib.\n\nDecent place, but no longer someplace I would go out of my way to visit."

S'How I expected more. Like WAAAAAY more. \n\nWent during Memorial Day weekend 2008 and it was my BF\'s (now fiance YAY!) and my first trip to Vegas together and since he is like a buffet fanatic, he was totally like "We have to go to the Bellagio Buffet. We have to go to the Bellagio Buffet!!! WE HAVE TO GO TO THE BELLAGIO BUFFET!!!!!" He used to live in Vegas so he would tell me all these good things about it and how it was rated this or how it got that award. Ok so I agreed to check it out and we went.\n\nWaited in line for like 2 hours on a Sunday and was not pleased at all with the end result. Maybe because we were at the Wynn\'s buffet the night before and were totally blown away by it. We had such high expectations for Bellagio\'s buffet since we read such good reviews about it and thought that if the Wynn was awesome, the Bellagio would be buffet heaven.\n\nThe food was unremarkable and I don\'t even remember what I ate besides the prime rib and crab legs. I know I tasted something of everything but really, I don\'t remember anything that I ate. That\'s what made it so bad. Oh, I also had a glass of green tea.\n\nThe decor reminded me of a Sizzler. I know, it\'s a buffet so don\'t expect chandeliers or famous paintings on the wall but it just didn\'t look like it would belong in the Bellagio. Maybe in a hotel like Harrah\'s across the street?\n\nAnd my poor BF-now fiance got a really bad case of heartburn a few hours later. =('

S'I was urged by a friend of mine to hit this buffet, as I had missed it on my Vegas trip last year. We went on a Sat night where it was supposed to be "gourmet" night with more selections. It was a pricey buffet, at $77 for both of us. The line was insane. It wrapped around most of the casino. What was horrible about it, was that the buffet on a SAT night, in Las Vegas, closes @10pm. We waited (along with about 100 people behind us) for over an hour to get to the cashier to pay. By that time, it was 9:40pm. I was sure my info was incorrect and the staff would tell me they were open to at least 11. I asked the cashier and she said "No we close @10". I said, you are telling me, that I have 20 minutes to inhale my food for $77??" She said the buffet closes at 10, but they dont put the food away till 10:30, so run around like a nut doing supermarket sweep and fill as many dishes as possible and sit and eat at your table.. I was going to leave, but then I thought I wasted SO MUCH TIME waiting to eat here, and in thinking of my fellow yelpers, I wanted to add my honest review to this site, so I stayed. I also told the staff that they need to have a staff member block off the line, or have a sign there that says "No entry after this point", or no entry after 9pm, because all those poor people behind us, who also waited 11/2 to 2 hours to eat would be kicked off the line when it closed @10. Not nice to have people there wasting their time in Vegas when there are 1000000000 other places they could be eating.\nThe food was not impressive. They had awful, runny,  split crab legs, sub-par sushi, very tough meat (I had a few different piece of lamb), God awful Chilean sea bass, which is one of my fav dishes, so that was even more disappointing, I also tried the elk and ostrich because it was there. But it was too gamey for me. The lobster ravioli was good, as were the hand rolls. But certainly not worth the wait or the price. You can get the crab legs in almost every other buffet in Vegas. \nWe were also SO SICK after we finished eating! The food went right through us both. We joked about having a $77 laxative. \nMirage buffet stood out- it had many different sections and offerings. AND- if you LOVE seafood, do yourself a favor and hit the Rio seafood buffet. (There\'s a free shuttle from the Paris hotel.)  That buffet is in a class by itself. Please see my review. I would not return or recommend the Bellagio buffet. I guess if this was the only buffet you hit in Vegas, you might be impressed. Having been here on vacation before in LV, I have seen way nicer spreads for less $. On an upnote, the hotel itself is gorgeous, and def worth a look in the flower conservatory or see the world\'s largest chocolate fountain. Good gelato and desserts there.\n\n************UPDATE**********\nI was so annoyed by my buffet experience that I sent part of this review to Bellagio, hoping they would re vamp their line set up, as to not leave customers out in the lurch with no dinner or food they had to pay $77 for and then scarf down because they close at 10pm. Shockingly to me- the manager called me (now that Im back in Nyc) and offered to comp me 2 tickets to eat there again (which I quickly told him I never would- even for free), or get a refund. So I told him to refund our credit card, and they complied. I was very appreciative of this gesture, but I honestly hope they #1 Improve the food there, and #2 Fix the line set up.'

S"The buffets in Vegas are greatly over rated and have started to get pricey to the point that a fine dining meal is often a better choice.  The Bellagio Buffet is probably the most consistently excellent food for buffet style dining.  They have an excellent selection of high quality ingredients that few places can match.  The flavor and cooking isn't always where it should be but that is the trade off challenge with buffet dining.  The biggest negative is that the legend of this place precedes it so there are often long lines to enter this gastronomic experience.  I would certainly recommend you experience dinner here at least once in your life and you might make a habit of it on your subsequent Vegas visits."

I've been to Vegas every year since turning 21 and each time I look forward to this buffet.\n\nThey have such a variety and high quality of food which separates it from the pack. They have Alaskan king crab, snow crab, shrimp, ribs, beef tenderloin, rack of lamb, kebobs, salad, sushi, sashimi, Asian favorites, pasta station, mussels, squid, and not to mention 20 types of desserts! I know the list above was not in any sort of order, but you get the idea.\n\nThis is a place you don't want to miss out on. Being a foodie, ive sat here for 2 hours before. \n\nTips:\n- come in between lunch and dinner (read between the lines)\n- the guy at the pasta station will steam your snow crabs if you like them warm. \n- there will always be a long line so come before the huge crowds for lunch and dinner\n\n--\nCheck out my other reviews at http://nextstopdc.blogspot.com/"

Lots of times you go to a buffet and it's snow crab, but this one was Alaskan king crab.  The great thing was that it was already sliced in half.  So we just had to dig it out of the shell (which my friend's hubby did for all of us).  Of course the crab is cold since it's was on ice, but our waiter told us to take it to one of the chefs and he would gladly steam it for us.\n\nSo my friend''s hubby took our big plate of crab and got it steamed to perfection.  So while the others were eating dessert, I was eating my fill of crab and my friend's hubby was eating his fill of poke.\n\nThe line was really long, but like everything else in Vegas, the dining area is huge and since it's a buffet the line moves pretty fast.  The buffet is worth the $29.95, but to eat all you can eat Alaskan king crab?  Now that's TOTALLY worth it.  At home we'd be paying double that for just a 1 lb.  Yummy!!"

Good pasta and pizza, but I try to limit my carb consumption at buffets so that I can eat more and get my $$ worth. \n\nNow on to desserts. My friends and I tried little bit of everything, there was really no wow factor. Everything was a bit bland, even flan and tiramisu. Come'on, how can you ever go wrong with flan and tiramisu?

They had Kobe beef roast, pesto mashed potatoes, roasted Mediterranean veggies and a variety of other wonderful items. We didn't have to wait long for a table, our drinks were filled constantly and I like that they serve you on the buffet (prevents random crap from getting into the food and is MUCH more sanitary). Great upscale selection, amazing food and price is on par with the other buffets."

S"Being from Vancouver might spoil me, but if this is the best pizza in America... I'll stick to what we have at home.\n\nThe pizzas came out quickly, and the ingredients were fresh, but that's as far as it goes.  If it's a new concept to you and you're used to greasy Pizza Hut pizza, you'll probably love the change.  For us, it was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nThe wait is long and might only be worth it if you can't get similar style pizza elsewhere.  Although they say it's first-come-first serve, they'll seat whichever group will fill up the table fully and pass over smaller groups even if their name is next on the list.  The quickest way to get a seat seemed to be if you come as a pair.  If you have a group of 3+, best bet is to arrive at around 3:15 you'll probably get in during the first seating so it'll only be a 1h45m in the end.  With Bar Bianco opening up at 4 with reasonable prices for drinks, thats the best way to go if you must try this place out."

S"Came for a late lunch, early dinner on a Saturday after the car show at the convention center. It was busy down town, so even at 230/3, we hade a 40 minute wait or so. We started at bar bianco next door with a few drinks and appetizers. I had the hard apple cider -really good and we shared the cheese plate and the ricotta crepes. Yum! The Bianco Dinapoli tomato sauce with the crepes was really good, we dipped our bread/crackers in it. \nOnce our table was ready they called us over to the restaurant. We had a table for 2 inside, it's a bit small inside, making it pretty cosy. \nWe ordered just the Rosa pizza, the one with pistachios. It was really good. Good medium size ish pizza with great flavor. Good for 2 to share. While I did like the bar, the appetizers, pizza, and the location...I'm just not sure I want to wait 40 mins to 2 hours to get in every time."

S"My wife and I visit Greater Phoenix a couple times a year.  Our fave restaurant is Pizzeria Bianco.  I have a story to illustrate how good the place is.  This is not a joke - this actually happened on our first visit.  As we were advised to do, we arrived several hours before they opened.  This was back when they had more limited hours and they weren't open for lunch.  We waited in the line, but it wasn't too hot out, and we had a nice time.  When we finally sat down, we were hungry.  But before we could order, a very normal looking middle-aged woman entered the restaurant and approached our table.  She said her son was visiting from out of state and they had to take him to the airport, and they didn't have time to stand in the line, but her son's favorite thing in the world is the Sonny Boy pizza from Pizzeria Bianco, so would we mind ordering a couple extra pizzas to go when we ordered our meal?  Apparently Pizzeria Bianco doesn't accept takeout orders, but they will give you a pizza or two to-go if you order them as part of your meal.  Before we could say no, the woman was already thanking us and I had $40 in my hand.  We were stunned.  When our server approached us, he asked if we knew that woman.  We said no, and we told him the truth when he asked what she wanted.  He told us he'd take care of the situation, and he went outside to chat with the woman.  Then she stormed back into the restaurant, told us we threw her under the bus, demanded her money back and marched back out of the restaurant.  Pizzeria Bianco is that good.\n\nWe started with the Antipasto with the awesome roasted veggies, I think we had the Caprese salad and we had 2 of the pizzas - the Sonny Boy and I think the Wiseguy.  Fantastic meal.  Pizzeria Bianco is that good."

S'It\'s Overrated! Plain and simple! The reason it\'s famous is that it offers aspects that most Phoenix restaurants lack: (1) It\'s not a chain (2) It has hip swanky northern California feel as it is next to a wine bar. It didn\'t hurt that Jerry Colangelo would publicly recommend this place for a date and soon it just became a hit.   It was a trendier option to the usual bar food right before a Suns game.  That\'s how it got famouse.  People would park and dine here early before Diamondback and Suns games and then walk to the game afterwards. However, when the #1 ranking came out, it just drove this place through the roof. The food hasn\'t changed. Yes, they make great pizza but like another reviewer mentioned, i can think of at least 5 places in Phoenix that offer better pizza.  Is it worth the wait...most certainly not.  It\'s just annoying now because any out-of-town guest wants to dine here and taste the "best pizza in America" and they are always let down.'

S"It was our last week living in Phoenix and we still hadn't tried Bianco. We knew this was something that absolutely had to be done before leaving or we could potentially regret it for eternity. It was now our last Saturday so why not go out with a bang-Bianco it is. We got there around 4:30 knowing based on Martha Stewart and most importantly, YELP reviewers, that we would be in for a long evening. First there was the 40 minute wait to get the name on the list. Once that phase was over we found a lovely piece of real estate at Bar Bianco to plant ourselves for what they said would be a 4 hour wait. Our party of 3 began with 1 bottle of wine, then 2 and then.....yep it had been 4 hours and we checked with the host Nazi who said it would be another hour...so...why not add a 3rd bottle of wine to the tab.. WOW \n\nBy this time we were pretty faded and so extremely excited to dive into the pies. \nThe food was astounding, service was great but the 5 hour wait was a little extreme for food. \n\nWe did it right-we had the right company, we didn't go into the experience hungry, and we enjoyed bar Bianco. \n\nIt really is a 'must do' when in Phoenix but I doubt it would be my regular spot since it isn't often that I have 6 spare hours (more with travel) to devote to a meal. But, for what it was, it was delectable."

S"My second trip to Pizzeria Bianco was just this last week... The first trip was YEARS ago and I remember waiting nearly 2 hours for a table and being half-tanked from drinking wine in the bar next door.  On this trip, I am happy to report my date and I walked in and were promptly seated at the bar (we opted for this vs a 45min wait for a table.)  We started with the Spiedini, skewered pcs of  italian fontina wrapped in prosciutto and served warm over arugula... Those were so tasty! Come on... it's delicious, smoky pig wrapped around lovely, velvety cheese! Then my date and I each ordered pizza (we could have easily shared, but opted for leftovers!)  I had the margherita and added the gaeta olives. Those olives were like little orgasms on my taste buds! They were a great compliment to the simplicity of the margherita and paired well with the chianti I chose as a beverage. \nI wouldn't say it doesn't get any better than Pizzeria Bianco, but they certainly do what they do well. The ambiance of the restaurant and neighboring bar is warm and welcoming. The servers are expedient and attentive. The prices are fair and you can find something for everyone on the menu!"

S'Blah, blah, blah.... best pizza in the world.... Almost silly for me to write a review about Chris Bianco\'s Pizzeria, but here goes....\n\nKari and I cook at home, for ourselves and for groups, 5 or 6 days a week unless we\'re traveling. And we often cook even when traveling. Doesn\'t leave us much time for going out to eat. That said, our little group hits Bianco EVERY week. It\'s a ritual. One night a week, we go early, drink wine, get a grilled cheese or cheese plate, and wait... sometimes waaaaaaaaaaait. Knowing them doesn\'t get you in faster; in fact it might be a detriment. But it never disappoints. You really just have to make a night of it.\n\nTips for making a night of it:\n  - come with people you know & like. a first date there can be brutal!\n  - bring layers: if the wait is long, the weather can change.\n  - plan on drinking and getting snacks next door at Bar Bianco.\n  - bring games or other distractions: we\'re the idiots that bring mexican train dominoes or dice every week.\n  - when Sue quotes you a time, it\'s accurate. live it.\n  - make friends with the people who are waiting near you. some of them are in our foodie circle now. it\'s like a micro-YELP at the picnic table.\n\nWe\'ve eaten pizza all over the country, all over the world... NYC, SF, Italy, Des Moines, IA & St Joe, MI... wherever! To say that one and only one pizza is the "Best Pizza in the World" is kind of ridiculous. But if I had to pick only one, last pizza, it would be Chris\' Special - whatever he wants to make that night.\n\n(disclaimer: i\'m not gonna order the special tonight, i usually let everyone else do that and eat theirs. i\'ll order exactly what i want: margherita w/mortadella, rosemary and garlic. but IF it were my last pizza ever... the special. and that night, the special would probably be: margherita w/mortadella, rosemary and garlic).'

S'Overall really impressed with the pizza. The food was consistent, not greasy, and clean. The prices are what you would expect. I do not make it downtown to often but would never turn down an opportunity to go to Bianco. I found the best setting is going with a group of friends. Enjoy a good bottle of vino and laugh with friends in a great atmosphere. Nothing negative to say about my experience or the food. Go and enjoy a delightful evening!\n\nBest advice about this style of pizza: \n\n-If you are a Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, or Dominos type of pizza lover you may not enjoy the pizza in the same manner. \n\n- If you are someone who enjoys a more traditional italian roots style pizza you will not be disappointed. Bianco did a great job creating a delicious signature style pizza. Two thumbs up!!!'

If I go to a restaurant and the wait is 30 minutes I'll go somewhere else. When I am hungry I want to eat right away! But I heard amazing things about Pizzeria Bianco so I had to try it out. I think the atmosphere was cute. It was my first time eating in a restaurant that used to be a house so I thought that was really cool. When I tried the pizza I wasn't blown away but it was good. At least I can say I've been to Bianco but I am not sure I would go back considering Cibo is right down the street and serves the same kind of pizza without the torture."

The pizza is good but it certainly isn't 1-2 hour wait good.  \n\nThe dining area is a little too small for my liking and I think it's pathetic that you have to pay them to park.  \n\nWe ordered a Margharita and a Sonny Boy.  Both pizzas were delicious but I couldn't believe how overhyped this place is.  \n\nIf you are looking for good pizza, then go.  This place has good pizza.  The best?  Nah."

My son honed in on the mozzarella, which Chris handmade everyday, and they would talk about developing gluten.\nWhen he moved downtown we tried to follow him for an occasional pie, but it got to be impossible. Major foodies were Dubbing Bianco, Best in the West...the country...the world. The lines were 2 hours for the very few seats. People started sharing reservation and line trading strategies. We went a couple of times and it was very good, but for me the best times were just before closing at the Town and Country, listening to Chris talk about wood-fired ovens and the search for perfection. If you haven't tried it, you owe it to yourself. Turn in your name, go to the Science Museum, come back have your pizza and file it in your memory.

People who claimed it was the best pizza in the world, and who had traveled to Phoenix on occasion specifically for the pie. Having recently moved to AZ, but being born and bred in NY myself, I was a bit skeptical. Best Pizza ever? In Phoenix?  C'mon, anybody who knows anything knows the best pizza is greasy cheesy NY thin crust. It's something in Manhattan's water that just makes it perfect, right?\n\n Well, my sister and her husband and I went for dinner after a long day of hiking in Sedona. We each ordered a different pizza so we could share and try as much as possible. I got the Rosa with salami added, sis got the classic margharita, and brother in law got the wiseguy (the one that I thought sounded the best). All of them were awesome, though I really liked the Rosa. It had the most amazing combination of rich and hearty tastes and you could tell, in all three, the ingredients were fresh and high quality. \n\nVerdict? Best pizza EVER? \nWell...i'm admittedly biased and probably  predisposed to what i grew up with, but you could certainly do a lot worse.

But the waiting can be pleasant at the bar next door, with a comfortable seat on the porch, a glass of wine and some olives to nibble on.

They recently started serving bbq and we're anxious to try it. The beef sandwich is large and very tasty with great au jus. The dewey sauce adds to ANY sandwich a creamy, slightly spicy experience. The hamburgers are cooked to perfection. The catfish are lightly breaded with (we think) cornmeal and delectable! We also discovered they're able to accommodate larger groups.

S"After reading about it's opening so many years ago, and then watching bit by bit as Bianco received accolades as some of the best pizza in the country, I FINALLY was in the area of business with an meal time to spare... Okay, so I lied.  I flew in purposely a bit early, so I could have a friend pick me up and grab lunch with me here.  (To be fair some of my other coworkers were on the plane with me, so it was probably a good call).\n\nSo we stuffed ourselves on three pizzas:\n\nSonny Boy - Enjoyable pizza, and I kept thinking that my wife would've loved thsi since they used olives.  But for those that aren't olive fans, fear not, the flavor of the olives is somewhat muted likely thanks to the heat of the oven and combines well with the saltiness of the salami.  Tasty combination, but not a clear winner...\n\nRosa - Chris Bianco's personal creation and contribution to the world of pizza, the pistachio, red onion, rosemary, parmesan pizza is quite simply... spectacular.  While it sounds odd, the way the pistachios roast with the oil on the pizza, combined with a slight bight of the red onion and a rosemary/parmesan flavor to smooth things out.  This really is a spectacular pizza, and our favorite of the three.  For those that like your crust a bit stiff, this is pretty ideal as well, as you don't have the fresh mozz and sauce pushing on the thin crust to make it soggy.  Seriously, get this pizza...\n\nMargherita - We ended on a margherita, and as many margheriitas, it's phenomenal for the first few minutes straight out of the oven.  The primary issue with Neapolitan style pizza is that it's crisp/firm right upon exit, and within 4 minutes or so, the middle will soak the sauce/moisture from the pizza, and become soggy surely but steadily... all the while, the flavors of the basil/mozz begin to meld better with the sauce.  That being said, this was still a great pizza, and being able to taste the difference from the first slice to the last slice is eye opening in terms of understanding how the ingredients play together over time.  A classic that worth getting.\n\nVerdict:  Bianco lives up to my years of waiting.  Is it the best pizza in the US?  I don't know if it deserves that designation necessarily... is it one of the best pizzas I've had in the states so far?  Absolutely.  My only regret is not having enough stomach to try one of every pizza on the menu... Will be back whenever I can make it!"

S"Echoing a lot of other reviews - it's definitely a bit overrated and the wait can be insane (even with a reservation; I can't imagine trying without one).. but it's still a fun and memorable experience with pretty good pizza and wine.\n\nIf you go, I definitely recommend going with a group of ~8-10 people and making a reservation well in advance (I've never been for lunch but I've heard that it's more feasible for that). \n\nThere's a nice beer and wine bar next door (which, I assume, strategically at least doesn't mind that people are waiting a long time to be seated).\n\nAs long as you go with a good group of people and consider the waiting to be part of the experience, I don't think you'll be disappointed.\n\nThe biggest shame for me is that they don't have patio seating (in Phoenix it's nice enough for that almost year round). That said - it's a beautiful and central location, and if you go when it's a bit chilly out (by Phoenix standards), you probably won't mind eating inside.\n\nI can't bring myself to give it an overwhelmingly positive review (mainly because they're so overrated) but I can say that other than the waiting (which is part of the experience if you're with the right people and not in a rush), I've never been disappointed or had a bad time there. Definitely recommend trying it out at least once."

S'Very good service! Each person working there helped out at our table (and there were only two of us)! We ordered the prosciutto starter and the margarita pizza with mushrooms. The starter was pretty good, but the pizza and mushrooms were excellent! We got our food very fast, and we were seated right away as well. Really like the set up of the place and the building. Quaint but very cool!\n\nIf you park in the Heritage garage, they will validate your pass, and your parking is then free for the first hour.'

S"After hearing all of the praise heaped on Pizzeria Bianco and how it was home to the best pizza in the country, I had huge expectations coming in to my dining experience here, and I seriously doubted that it could live up to all of the hype. Of course, as you can see based on my rating, Pizzeria Bianco surprisingly lived up to my expectations and then some. \n\nI came to Phoenix as part of a family vacation, but we only had a couple of hours to spend in the city before we had to leave. Although my family generally despises waiting for a table at a restaurant (any wait time over 20 minutes usually means we look for a different restaurant), I managed to persuade them to wait at Pizzeria Bianco because, well, we had come all the way from New Jersey and would probably not be coming back to Phoenix anytime soon. Of course, since we were in Phoenix on a Friday evening in mid-June, there was a pretty long line and wait time even when we arrived at 9 pm. We didn't get seated until nearly 11 pm, making for the longest wait my family had ever endured for a table at a restaurant. \n\nBased on the reviews I had read, I decided to order one each of the Rosa (Parmigiano Reggiano, Red Onion, Arizona Pistachios), Sonny Boy (Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives), and Wiseguy (Wood Roasted Onion, Smoked Mozzarella, Fennel Sausage) to share between four people. First off, let me say that the crust on all of the pizzas we shared was absolutely phenomenal. There was a really nice char on the crust, and somehow, the crisp crust maintained a level of pliancy which I did not think was possible. This was my first experience with Neapolitan-style pizza, so unfortunately, my experience here at Pizzeria Bianco may have set the bar exceedingly high for my future visits to Neapolitan-style pizzerias. While I generally favor meat toppings, I was astounded to discover that the Rosa was my favorite pie among the three we had ordered. Everything about the pie - the sharp bite of the Parmigiano Reggiano, the sweetness of the red onion, and the crunch and nuttiness of the pistachios - worked harmoniously to create a pizza that was greater than the sum of its parts. I was absolutely blown away by how delicious this pie was, and I wish I had ordered another Rosa for myself. I thought the Wiseguy was extremely good as well. The combination of sausage, onion, and mozzarella made for a more conventional flavor profile, though it was by no means ordinary. As for the Sonny Boy, I thought it was quite salty; of the three pies, I thought this one was the least successful, as the salt content from the salami and olives seemed to overwhelm the pie.\n\nSo do I think that Pizzeria Bianco serves up the greatest pizza in the country? I really don't know, as I certainly have not eaten at many of the nation's top pizzerias. However, I will say that the pizzas from Pizzeria Bianco are delicious and are most definitely worthy of all of the praise and acclaim showered upon them. Despite the ridiculous wait time, I believe that Pizzeria Bianco's pizzas are worth waiting for (well, I'd wait up to 2 hours; I doubt that there's any food that I'd wait 4 hours for, regardless of how good it may be). If you are ever in the Phoenix area, definitely make a point of stopping by to try it for yourself."

S"Some out of town friends and I finally checked out Pizzeria Bianco in Heritage Square downtown. My friends were vegetarians and my meat-lover self was completely outvoted, so we tried a few pies that I normally wouldn't even glance at on the menu. We tried the Rosemary pizza...and I learned I'm allergic to pistachio's - who knew!?  The Margherita pizza was truly delicious - crisp, flavorful and the aroma of the basil was delightful.  We expected a long wait, and got an even longer wait.  On the plus side, it gave us more time to drink lots of wine and catch up!   I hear the wait times have improved as of late and am happy to see the expansions of this restaurant.   Looking forward to my next visit and trying new options!   Great local pizza place, proud to have Pizzeria Bianco in Phoenix!"

S'I have been to Pizzeria Bianco a few times now and have loved every visit! \n\nMy trick is to get there around 4:15 (during months when the weather is nice), get in line, and send someone to the bar to grab drinks to make waiting in line a little bit more enjoyable.  Doors open at 5, you get in with the first seating and you\'re good to go.  Or, if you don\'t get in the first seating, you put your name on the list (maybe a 45-60 min wait) and you go find a table in the bar and order an appetizer.\n\nMy first trip to Bianco, I was wondering if I would be able to tell if it really was better than the rest.  (Please note, this was several years ago when I was early in my "good pizza" knowledge).  \n\nFor me, this pizza got better with every bite.  It went something like . . .\n\nFirst bite:  Yeah, this is good.\nSecond bite:  Wow, I really like this sauce.\nThird bite:  Man, these tomatoes are really fresh!\nFourth bite:  OK, I\'m impressed, the sausage isn\'t greasy at all!\n\nThe Wiseguy and the Margarita are my favorites.  Oh, and I really love that arugula one.  Ok, they are all great.  They have a great antipasto platter too!\n\nI understand that people are frustrated by the long wait and the small space.  What I don\'t understand are all of the demands or suggestions.  \n"Bianco needs to do something about the long wait."\n"They need to serve us faster."\n"They need a bigger space."\nThey need to do this . . .\nThey should really do that . . .\n\nThe way I see it, they really don\'t have to do anything!  It seems to me their business is running quite well as it is.  If they choose not to open up more tables, or get a bigger space, or whatever it is, at the risk of lowering the quality of the food, then I have to respect that.\n\nJust my two cents.  Take it or leave it.'

S"My mother and several of her friends would always rave about this place. For years, I just never bothered going here because I just don't like the downtown Phoenix area. A few months ago, though, I finally decided to give it a try. Some family members and I met up downtown and were ready to be blown away by some incredible pizza!\n\nWe ended up waiting forever-- over two hours-- to get in. This wasn't a huge shock, so I won't really factor that into my review rating. It was a long wait, but we knew that it would be. However, it's what came after the long wait that disappointed us. Once we were finally in, it took forever for our order to come out. We were also split up into three separate groups even though our party wasn't that large. That's fine, too. They were busy and pretty packed, so I understand that.\n\nThe pizzas, though, were extremely unimpressive. Even my mother commented on how she did not really enjoy her pizza that much, especially when compared to previous experiences. My pizza was so unexciting that I don't even remember what I had ordered now, which is pretty uncommon for me! It wasn't disgusting, but it was so boring that I can't even recall eating it! I think this sentiment was shared amongst all of us that night. For the price and the hype, it just didn't live up to our expectations.\n\nMy mother also mentioned to me that Chris Bianco no longer makes the pizzas because of some allergy he has or something. Perhaps this is why the quality of the pizzas has gone down? I'm not sure, but either way I just wasn't impressed. I was so excited to eat here, too!"

Yes there is a long wait (2-3 Hours sometimes) but if you can't find any friends that you would like to spend a few hours with next door at the bar drinking wine and eating a cheese platter and some olives, then maybe you should just call for delivery and stay in your cave.  The ingredients are minimal on your pizza but you can' TASTE the freshness, and that beats all greasy and heavy pizza in my book! So come prepared to wait, but Bar Bianco, which is less than 20 steps away will help entertain you while you wait. Food and service are exceptional!"

S"Decided on a whim at the last minute to go here for dinner tonight, I guess that's not the thing to do here.  Worked out perfect though, arrived at just about 4pm to see a hand full of people waiting and the the restaurant didn't open till 5pm.  After a short debate we decided to stay, it helped that there was ample shade.  The wait while hot was not uncomfortable and for the most part, newbies and veterans honored each others arrival order.  40 seats is not much for a place that does this much business and it was surprising to learn that most waiting were from out of town.  I also learned that reservations are accepted on line for parties of 6 to 10 and only 3 reservations per night.  Reservations are usually 1 1/2 to 2 months out.  Luckily for us there was only one reserved table for 10 ahead of everyone.  5 o'clock rolled around and the loading procedure ran smooth as clock work and we had drink and food orders in by quarter after.  Service was excellent and fast with just the right amount of time between salad and main course.  I could not have asked for much more from my food, maybe a bit more basil on my mozzarella and tomato salad, everything was amazing including my Mexican coke.  We ordered 2 pizzas, both wood fire baked to perfection.  I could have eaten a whole loaf of the bread that comes with the salads, or for $2 on its own.  None of our food was greasy or soggy, the olive oil they use is excellent and the fresh mozzarella mouth watering.  I will go back again, planning on getting there an hour before opening.  Although the food is amazing and well worth an hours wait in the Phoenix sun and heat, I would not wait for 4 to 6 hours as some people do.  So for me this was a win and a lucky last minute dinner decision."

Waited just about an hour, if not less (it was June, after all, not exactly Phoenix's popular season). The pizza was good. Really good, in fact. And everyone was very happy with their pizzas and the service. \n\nNow for the frank part.

S'I would understand the skepticism from those who might say "Really?  The \'Best Pizza in the World\' is in Phoenix?"  Well, I haven\'t been around the world, so I can\'t say, but what I CAN say is that the pizza at Pizzeria Bianco is outstanding.  My brother just visited but was only here on a Sunday, and he was very upset they weren\'t open because he had been looking forward to returning for months!  It\'s usually pretty busy - you might get lucky and be seated immediately, but be prepared to wait.  I\'ve tried four of their pizzas and they are all outstanding.  The dough is probably the best I\'ve ever had, the combination of flavors is simple and powerful, the sausage is exquisite (made specifically for the restaurant), and the prices are outstanding for the quality of the food.  It\'s a place that I will treasure taking visitors, very conveniently located downtown (though parking can be tough in the small lot immediately adjacent).  Best in the world?  Possibly - certainly worth deciding for yourself!'

S"Pizzeria Bianco definitely lives up to their hype.\n\nYes, the wait to eat there is VERY long, but I thought it was worth it, especially when you have great company. I've only gotten their white pizzas there but I have loved them both. The last time I went there, I got the Sonny Boy and it was really good. I've never seen pistachios on a pizza and was a little hesitant, but it turned out to be delicious! The crust on these pizzas is probably the best I've had anywhere and I love to try out pizza places. It is the perfect combination of crunchy, crispy, and chewy. \n\nWe also got a salad (which comes with their bread) and it was a great, light way to start. It wasn't anything special, but we were starving so the bread definitely helped fill out stomachs up a little bit and made us happy campers after the long wait. :)\n\nWhenever people visit, I always take them here and Camelback mountain because I feel like these two are staples of Arizona."

S'What to say about Bianco that hasn\'t already been said? The ingredients are fresh, the ideas are creative and the execution is flawless. We waited for about 30 minutes next door in "Bar Bianco." Basically taking our apps in a different building. No big deal and a comfortable way to wait. Once shuffled over to the main house, we enjoyed three pizzas: Margherita, Rosa and Biancoverde. All were exceptionally done. My favorite was the Biancoverde with ricotta and arugula. The Rosa is complex and not a universal crowd pleaser, for some the rosemary and onion can be overpowering. I liked it tho. But you have to try a selection to pick your favorite.  One little detail I love is the use of Futura font on their menus and t-shirts. Very Wes Anderson. Is it the best pizza in the country, probably not but the best in the region is an easy title to bestow.'

S"I was in town for the Phoenix Comic Con and this was nearby and highly rated so I thought I'd give it a try.  For the most part, I was not disappointed.\n\nI had a Sprite and the Sonny Boy.  The Sprite is the Mexican kind in the bottle made with real sugar and was a pleasant surprise.  Watching the bartender fill up the glass for it by sticking said glass into the ice bin was not.  Thankfully, all the rest of the staff used the scoop to fill up the glasses, and the Sprite came chilled, so I just skipped the glass with ice.\n\nThe Sonny Boy was very, very good. I highly recommend it.  They were not stingy with the Sopressato, which was nice to see.\n\nThe staff were all very friendly and responsive, props to them.\n\nAll in all though, I have Settebello in Vegas, which is almost exactly what Pizzeria Bianco is, just with a larger menu and at a lower cost.  I do not at all regret going into Pizzeria Bianco, but to be honest I would not do so again.  My individual pizza and soda cost $27 after standard tip.  That is insane.  The exact same thing at the other equivalent places in other towns would only set me back  $17.  I could have two meals, one with a beer, somewhere else for that kind of money and probably still be happy.\n\nIf/When I go back to Phoenix, I would eat somewhere else, but if someone asked me if the food was good, I would say absolutely."

S"Here is my theory, and Im sure in some cases I'm totally wrong, but its just a theory.  Most of the people who eat here don't have reservations, which means waiting in line for hours, even after you get your name on the list, you have to wait longer. So most people go over to the bar next door and drink, if you think  about it, by the time you  get your pizza you have waited at least 3 or more hours, and more than likely are drunk. Combine that with the preconceived notions they have already heard about this place, it makes for one amazing pizza.\n\nNow I'm not trying to hate on this place at all, but it is just so overrated. The pizza was really good, the customer service was horrible, price was okay. My friends and I had reservations and ended up not getting a table until 30 minutes after our reservations were supposed to start. If you have a ton of time on your hands I recommend it, but your not missing too much. I have heard that Cibo pizza is actually better, and you don't have to wait in a ridiculous  line."

S"We arrived for lunch right at 11 and waited for them to open the doors. There was already a good size crowd waiting to get in. We were seated right away and service was fairly quick (total lunch took about an hour, not too bad for sit-down service). \n\nSince it was a work lunch, we couldn't have any beer or wine. they have 3 options: Coke, diet Coke or sweet tea (all bottles). No fountain drinks at all. That was fine by me, water is cheaper. It is worth noting that the beer they have on tap (Thunder Head or something ) is REALLY tasty and VERY hard to find anywhere else. It's available next door at Bar Bianco.\n\nThey only have 6 pizza options and 6 additional topping options. If you want fruit or something on your pizza, you better go somewhere else, because that's not what they do. \n\nI had the Rosa pizza, with parmegiano reggiano, red onions and pistachios. it was quite good, but not amazing. Two friends had the margherita pizza and one had the one with fennel sausage. One friend LOVED his margherita pizza but hated mine; I had a piece of his and thought it was bland. The guy who had the sausage pizza found it to be so-so. I always thought they got a little crazy with the sausage. It's pretty strong tasting stuff, you should go easy on it.\n\nAfter lunch, don't expect dessert. They don't have any. They do have a huge coffee machine, so you can have your espresso or cappuccino. \n\nIf you come at dinner time, be prepared to wait. You can make reservations for 6 or more, but you have to do that weeks in advance. \n\nHonestly, no matter what you've heard, this is NOT the best pizza in the Valley. La Grande Orange does it as well or better, plus they have more topping options and are more than happy to give you a half and half pizza. This place is a little snooty. My friend had a salad and wanted to add the fennel sausage to it (he's on a protein diet). They said the sausage is for the pizza only! Really??\n\nSo, if you really want to try it, go right ahead and make up your own mind. Maybe come at lunch time. Not nearly as busy and it has all the same food (unlike Cibo, which has a different menu at dinner). But you would probably be happier at Cibo or La Grande Orange. Both make awesome pizza with more options and are way more friendly about it."

S'With nearly a thousand reviews of PIZZERIA BIANCO the polarity between love & hate is amazing. HERE IS THE ONLY REVIEW YOU\'LL EVER NEED TO READ.\n\nOn one side of the aisle, you have the idiot trendoids who love bragging about how long they\'ll wait in line for restaurants, and how they were eating there before anybody else. They\'ll gladly report, "THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA EVER, WELL WORTH THE 3 HOUR WAIT!!!!" They also don\'t mind overpaying to be underfed.\nThese people are easily recognized by their ability to spend $300 on an outfit that makes them look homeless and by their incessant need to always be sporting at least one Apple product.\n\nThe other camp is the folks who hate this place on a near personal level. They act as insulted by the food or wait time as they would be by a Nazi-sympathizer or a spit in the face. These are people who hate most everything that has proven to be popular with other people, and they hate Pizzeria Bianco, even though there\'s nothing hatable here.\n\nBoth groups are generously represented here. Both groups are full of shit. HERE\'S THE TRUTH.\n\nBest Pizza Ever? Hell no. You\'d have to be functionally retarded to call this the "BEST" pizza you\'ve ever eaten. In a lot of books, what is being served here wouldn\'t even qualify as pizza. An overly simple menu offers only 6 pie choices, 3 of which offer no tomato sauce and 2 offering no cheese. Pizzeria Bianco is really more of a Lavash than a pizza in that the crust is more of a toasted cracker than a pizza crust. This will lead to a soggy mess only minutes after your pie comes out of the oven. Is there any way, honestly, you can call something a pizza when your ingredient menu EXCLUDES PEPPERONI, MEATBALLS (ground beef of any kind), & GREEN PEPPERS. That\'s right, none of these exists on the premises. BEST PIZZA EVER?!? C\'mon Corky, Life Goes On Without Pizzeria Bianco.\n\nWorst Pizza Ever? Seriously? You never had a Totino\'s or a Lil Caesar\'s $5 crap pie? I truly believe the people who hate Pizzeria Bianco are really just hating on the people stupid enough to proclaim undying love for this place. This pizza(?) is not offensive in the least, even if it isn\'t really pizza. We actually liked the flavor of our WISE GUY. Again, we questioned whether of not it should even be classified as a pizza, but it was none-the-less tasty. Had I waited 2-3 hours, would I have been pissed off? Yep. Not to the point where I\'m pissed off for life at everybody involved with the joint, like they shot my dog. Then again I\'m not stupid enough to wait 2-3 hours at a place like this.\n\nThere\'s the rub with Pizzeria Bianco....the people who are claiming it to be the "best ever" and "well worth the hours wait" are absolute idiots, full of shit to the point of turning their eyes brown. Those who hate Pizzeria Bianco and it\'s fans like they contribute to Al Qaeda, have no real basis for their hatred and are way too over-reactive.\n\nSo judge for yourself.\n\nGo down on a Saturday between 11am & noon to avoid the notorious wait times, drink a cold one and have lunch. You\'ll discover what we did; Pizzeria Bianco is simply a charming little place with nice people serving what may or may not be pizza. But that ain\'t so bad.'

You HAVE heard of Pizzeria Bianco before, right?!??\n\nFresh, local ingredients, a Chef who cares more about his craft than arguably anyone in town and a great location - that's a recipe for fame, Kids. We should consider ourselves lucky to have such a gem in our city.   Not to mention, the Rosa is hands-down, without question the BEST pizza I've ever had in my life.  \n\nWorried about the wait?

Just like everyone tells you, you're going to wait 2.5 to 3 hours for a table for two. Sounds ridiculous, but just be prepared to make an evening out of it (and do not come starving). We sat at the bar next door during our wait which is a fabulously cozy, home. They have small shared plates and a nice selection of beer and wine to choose from while you wait. When it came to the actual pizza - yes, it was good but I think you can find better - or at least comparable elsewhere. Overall, great expereience but not worth the hype."

I have to add that we are originally from New Haven, CT where the #1 rated pizza restaurant in the US is located - Pepe's pizza, and we loved this place.  Will definitely go back.

I don't know maybe this just isn't my type of pizza because it is definetely a style of its own.  \n\nAll the other reviews are good so maybe I am just used to traditional American pizza places, but I am glad I did not bring someone from out of town here with me because I would have been embarassed.\n\nI easily ate the entire Marghertta pizza on my own $15.

S'We visited the one at Town and Country and it was terrible. It cost an extra $5 to have sausage added to a pizza that had tomato sauce and cheese (not all the pizzas do). The sausage was practically tasteless and in big chunks, very little cheese, very little sauce and the crust was so thin in places that even the almost non-existent toppings were falling off. We asked if they use the same ingredients and recipes as the downtown location and were told they do. No atmosphere, tiny, uncomfortable tables and chairs. My husband wanted a diet Coke and was told they had Coke Lite which was the same thing. It was in a glass bottle and was imported from Mexico. Why would you import your Coke from Mexico?

( they were bussing our table before we were finished and took my plate WHILE I was eating). We live in Chicago and have been in the pizza business for over 20 years, so I suppose we were expecting more. The crust was soggy but the ingredients were fresh, which was good. My 9 dollar glass of wine was okay, but not worth the money. Also, if your child likes juice or chocolate milk, they have none. Just coke, coke light (not diet), iced tea and sprite. I would never go there and wait 1 or 2 hours. \nIn an area that is in desperate need for good pizza, I guess this is a winner. However, we will not return. It is also VERY pricy for what they have to offer.'

You must make it well in advance and definitely worth it - did this once and waited 15 minutes upon arriving to the restaurant.\n\nThe other 2 times I went to Bianco was when I had a craving for the delicious pizza. After placing our name on the list, we would head over to the wine bar next door. Order a bottle of wine, some apps and take a seat at the picnic table outside. Just as we finished our bottle of wine, the hostess found us and we were taken into our table.

S'Pizzeria Bianco represented a conundrum of pizzeria dining for me. On the one hand, it\'s hard not to appreciate the labor of love and culinary excellence that goes into their pizzas, from the fresh ingredients to the brick oven to the intimate, urban setting of the place. On the other hand, it\'s hard to justify a two hour or more wait, mediocre wait staff, and tasty, though not one of a kind flavor of the pizza there. My girlfriend loves to cook, and always keeps up to date on the nearby restaurants that get rave reviews and/or have staked their claim in the culinary industry. Naturally, she had this place on her radar for a while. Pizzeria Bianco has been called the best pizzeria in the country by such people as Rachel Ray and many others who have even eaten at pizza powerhouses like New York or Chicago. I have never eaten pizza in either of those cities, and yet I even had a hard time imagining that a pizzeria in Phoenix could be better than what they have out there. That is the collective theory, however, and people flock from all over to eat here. Like I said, I can see why it gets rave reviews from a culinary standpoint, but I really didn\'t find the pizza to be worthy of being called "best in the country." If you\'re lucky enough to eat here without having to wait for hours, it is a pretty great pizzeria and you\'d be hard pressed to find fresher ingredients. If you aren\'t a pizza snob, though, you\'ll find that other places like Grimaldi\'s and Oreganos serve up delicious, if not better, pizza with a substantially shorter wait time.'

Not for 3hours, that just pushes you over the top with patience and so much more.  Good thing for them I was with a close friend so it was definitely a fun wait time to catch up in, but we were hungry soooo hungry.  Walked around all over.... CHASE Stadium picked up hot dogs off food vendor, overlooked at monster rally going on, walked around museum areas and etc..\n\nThe wait is so insane they have another house by them just for people to wait at, drink & snack there =/  Its really like a house inside, kinda weird but koo at the same time.  Dim lights in there.  Pizzeria Bianco already has a couple patio wood tables outside around it for people to chill at too.  Its just a waiting frenzy!\n\nPizza: Oven brick baked.  Seriously was good though.  Good enough for 1hour wait for 2 people, maybe 1 1/2 - 2hour wait for table of 4.  Thin Pizza, fresh & oOOo so yummy.  Better than my Under the Brooklyn Bridge Pizza, almost.... but hey freaking good for a place like Arizona right?\nSalad - not really worth it.  Drinks are mostly bottled, so dont get it if you're super thirsty.\n\nTake Out: No take out unless you're seated.  If seated, you need to order it the same time you put in your order.\n\nService:  You'll be surprised.  If you sit at the bar, its wonderful service.  The time wait apology, drink order, food order chat, appitz comes, food comes & a nice check on how we like it etc....\n\nGroups: Better to come by yourself, two people or 4 at max.  If you come with 3, lets just hope it doesn't take an hour longer because of the 3rd person haha\n\nParking: Difficult to find.\n\nTip: It opens around 5:30pm I think.  Come no later than 4pm!

As for the pizza, it's not your 'normal' style which would be fine if it was good or an unusual treat, but it wasn't either.  And pricey to boot.

But the highlight for me was their red sauce; not too sweet, just a bit of tang, a little spice, and very well rounded. It really made the pizza for me. Their other "sauces" or lack thereof, left a bit to be desired when alternating bites between pies:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pizzeria-bianco-phoenix?select=tL440Sn0GC3w2KoITKk8Rw#tL440Sn0GC3w2KoITKk8Rw\n\nI was told horror stories of the lines, but we got there just as the opened for lunch on a random week day and the place was empty.

I have been twice over the years and would definitely go back if given the opportunity.  \n\nExpect to wait!!!  Pizzeria Bianco has their system down.  They open for dinner only and people get there early (like 2 hours early) and wait in line.  When they open the doors, they take you in order.  If you are not towards the front of the line, don\'t think you will get seated first round because this place is SMALL!  Your name then gets put on "the list" and you are free to wander about for a couple hours.  I have heard of people coming to downtown to watch a baseball game (the stadium is walking distance) and they put their name in at Pizzeria Bianco first, go watch the game, and then make it back in time for the reservation.  Genius!\n\nOther than the wait, you MUST like THIN CRUST pizza.  Chicago style lovers beware.  You will not get your usual carb overload here.  Sorry.  \n\nThis pizza is made fresh with really fresh ingredients.  They don\'t mess around.  And don\'t think you can order extra pizzas to take home.  It\'s not allowed - at least not when I was there.  This of this place similar to the "Soup Nazi" episode of Seinfeld.

Then offered us a complimentary salad to make up or it. We didn't want the salad because we weren't that hungry, plus after 45 minutes they finally put some bread on our table. When the pizza came, our server and everyone else ignored us. No manager even came to apologize. So when we got the bill we expected at least 20% off especially since we didn't want the salad.

The environment was so welcoming I didn't want to leave so I'll definitely return. Sometimes I like to consider myself a pizzaficionado and the pizza here was not disappointing one bit. I selected the Wiseguy for my first pie and boy ole boy was this love at first sight. I've never seen a pizza deck with onion filled with so much flavor. The sausage was so moist and blended well with the everything. The crust was so robust smoke seem to pour from my nose with each bite.

It is nice that the little bar place is next door because it takes your mind off of the wait a little bit...but three hours is just a little much. If I hadn\'t been there with friends who had driven from Mesa to meet up, there is no way I would have even entertained the thought of sticking around.\n\nBy the time we actually sat down to eat, I would have chowed down on a piece of cardboard with pepperoni drawn on it in red Sharpie. Yeah, they use "good" ingredients. Yeah, they have this fancy-schmancy wood fired oven. Yeah, yeah, yeah...it was okay. For the wait we had, I expected a lot more...the pizza was average at best.\n\nOn the other hand, the appetizers we got were off the charts amazing. Prosciutto and asparagus, roasted veggies and bread w/ good EVOO...how can you go wrong, right?\n\nSorry Phoenix, you\'re pizza gem was a big disappointment. As a pizza lover, I think it was okay...but unfortunately the wait overshadowed the food and I\'ll never go back.'

S"It's pretty hard to find a better wood fired pizza, it's the little things that set Pizzeria Bianco apart!  It is a little on the expensive side, and the waits can be a little long, but don't let that stop you.   \n\nFirst off, the wine bar next store is perfect.  We usually grab a bottle of wine and a cheese plate and enjoy the Hertiage District gardens.  There's also a pretty decent pub across the street, but since the wine bar is linked to Bianco they'll come find you there when your table is ready-a small bonus.\n\nOf course, the real reason to come is the pizza!  Supposedly Chris Bianco spent a few years hunting down the perfect flour, water, and yeast for his unique pies.  Whether it's true or just a legend, the taste seems to back it up.  The crust has a perfect light and chewy texture that's still crisp on the outside.  It has a nutty flavor that I haven't had anywhere else, probably a combination of the wood smoke and overnight resting of the dough.  I usually go for the Sonny Boy (tomato sauce, salami, and olives)  but you can't go wrong with any of the six pizza choices I've tried.  If you do go for an option with the red sauce, you'll be impressed by the simple, fresh taste of the superb tomatoes.  The cheese and remaining ingredients are every bit as fresh and complimentary to the balanced flavors.  Bianco is the perfect special occasion pizza."

S"I came to Pizzeria Bianco for lunch almost by accident (it's over by the Science Center... science makes me hungry!). We ordered the Sonny boy (Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Salami, Gaeta Olives). \n\nI don't even like olives and I enjoyed this pizza! (Warning: a lot, a lot, a lot of olives. We asked them to only do half olives too and you can barely see the mozzarella). The crust was thin and lovely. It is a very oily pizza, but in the best way. \n\nI would definitely come again for lunch, but it isn't amazing enough for me to wait more than an hour for dinner."

The waitstaff is friendly and you can tell that this place is definitely popular among the locals given that it was busy even at 2pm on a wednesday afternoon. The menu isn\'t extremely large, but it\'s the quality of the ingredients that count in this case.\n\nTried out the "Sonny Boy" and the "Wise Guy" pizzas and both tasted pretty good while coming straight out from the oven. This is NOT your typical pizza spot with supreme pizzas, but a place you go to enjoy the creativity and the craftmanship of someone\'s idea!\n\nNote: Valet parking costs about $3'

S"This spot on the strip has over 2,500 Yelp reviews. Good grief. Since there's no Earl of Sandwich in the Pacific NW (but happens to be in many other states), it made me that much more curious to try it.\n\nThis location inside Planet Hollywood looks great. Even got all the Earls of Sandwich on one of the walls. Larger portrait for the actual guy responsible for creating the sandwich. I guess we can all thank him now for being such a gambling addict.\n\nEarl of Sandwich makes their own artisan bread, basically amounting to a buttery sandwich roll that lightly toasts in their conveyor-belt oven. Each sandwich is made and toasted to order.\n\nI had one of the signature sandwiches: the Full Montagu ($6.49). Juicy, tender slices of meat, mustard, lettuce, and tomato. The lettuce looked a bit wilted, not sure if that was from it going through the oven. Added some Grey Poupon just for the hell of it.\n\nFrankly, the sandwich was small for the amount paid. Merely a snack in my eyes.\n\nThere are usually a couple different types of coffee, a Kona blend and a dark roast. Good coffee here, and you can help yourself for a couple bucks.\n\nOverall, I liked what I saw. I hope to return in the future!"

I don't know how they make it taste so good or it might just be my imagination since I only get a Earl of Sandwich a couple times a year. Either way I highly recommend making a stop here if you're in Las Vegas.\n\nMy absolute favorite is the Chicken Avocado sandwich, it's perfectly warm, chewy, and saucy.  The Full Montague is not bad as well if you're not feeling in a chicken mood.\n\nOne critique: I wouldn't recommend getting the broccoli cheddar soup, in my opinion it was a bit too salty for my taste.\n\nThis place is open 24 hours which makes it a great late-night snack.The line can get pretty long at peak times, but I promise it's worth the wait."

And way better on both my wallet and waist. Easy to say that nothing comes cheap in Vegas except for those lovely free drinks. But good food is hard on your wallet and even harder to find. Since I was staying at Planet Hollywood Westgate, I have actually been at Earl's a total of 5 times for this trip. And each time had me wishing that they would add some more veggies to my bad vodka soaked diet. The bread was sooo DELICIOUS but full of butter and grease. I found out that you can actually ask for veggies or extras in it without a charge! I wish I knew that earlier!! :( But nonetheless it is a pretty good deal for being in Vegas and the portions are not TOO bad. If you're a girl you will be full off of $7 and for a guy.. well it sucks to be you in Vegas anyhow :("

Come home starving - finish the other half that night or the next morning. Wake up. Day Club. Earl's.\nReally what more do you need?

S'I stayed at Planet Hollywood during my Vegas trip, and being a first, I had no idea what was around. Luckily for me, a few of my friends that went with me were "experienced" in this matter, so they suggested we go eat at Earl of Sandwich. First off, my group got there VERY late, so I thought they had closed.... NOPE. Earls is a 24 hour place which makes this one of the best places to go for late nights and just regular meals. \n\nAs for the actual food, it\'s pretty damn cheap for what you get: a quality sandwich for under $10 (and when I say quality, I mean quality). I tried a few sandwiches here (got  2 on my first trip, and came during different times of the day), and they\'re all pretty good. I tried my friend\'s soup which wasn\'t the best, but still decent for what it was. \n\nThe lines can get very long since this is one of the few 24 hour food places, but the wait is quite small. Service is fast so don\'t get turned away by any sort of line.\n\nOverall, a great place to go to at Vegas. Not a standard recommendation when you go to the City of Sin, but definitely a place to stop by if you\'re around Planet Hollywood.'

Had there been other 24-hour options in PH, I likely would not have gone back a second time, but at 4:30 in the morning this is the only place you can get food in the hotel (and after 6 hours of stilettos, there was no way anyone was dragging me outside). Probably the best thing about this place is that it's priced reasonably for a well-established Vegas eatery (and certainly more reasonably than the $20 room service wrap).\n\nOn my first visit, I tried the chicken caesar wrap, and it was average. There was a ton of lettuce compared to everything else that was on the wrap, and the tortilla was on the stiff side. Overall it was just okay, but out of 5 girls only a couple enjoyed their sandwiches.

We were able to find seats and before we knew it our sandwiches were ready. The bread was toasty to perfection, the ratio between meat and veggies was perfect and their sauce and cheese complimented the sandwich very well. I tried using the mustard they provided, but I realized after a few horrible bites that their mustard really overpowers the taste of the sandwich. I opted to eat my 2nd half of the Earl's Club plain and it was muuchhh yummier left alone.\n\n\nThe second day I was starving again so I ran over to Earl's to grab a sandwich again. This time we ordered the Full Montagu and it was definitely a great sandwich. Unlike the Earl's Club which was a bit salty, the Full Montagu was much more balanced in terms of flavoring and it was seriously a great delight. I'd definitely recommend getting the Full Montagu and dripping on some of the Tabasco sauce they have at the tables. I'm literally drooling as I write this review thinking about these sandwiches.\n\n\nOverall, Earl's was definitely worth the visits and at 5.99 per sandwich, you can't really go wrong. The service is pretty fast considering how many people there are waiting for food. This place is how ALL sandwiches should taste! Swing by if you're around the area by Planet Hollywood!!!"

It\'s kind of like an assembly line with a lot of shouting and noise and pretty good sandwiches.  Nothing to write home about.  Their drink selection was quite bad.  The set up is like just get through the line already!!!  Pay me the money!!\nIt is definitely Not a mom and pop shop, so why not go find one?  Please someone in Vegas find us a good sami shop!!!'

Someone takes your order and gives you a beeper, then you slide on down to pay for it. It's real cheap too, can't remember the exact price but between $5-6 for the Sandwiches. \n\nHad the Earl's Club: Roasted Turkey, Bacon, Swiss, Lettuce, Tomatoes & Sauce which hit the spot! it looks small, but it gets you very full, I barely finished it. It was super fresh and hot too! it's just really good\n\nI recommend everyone to try it and take some to go if there isn't one in your area."

What a wonderful feeling it was to discover this casual sandwich spot located inside Planet Hollywood.   It is quick, easy, delicious, satisfying and cheap!!!  $5.99 for any sandwich, wrap or salad! Yes, true!\n\nI love love their BLT.  The Caribbean Jerk Chicken Sandwich and Tuna Melt are also very popular and delicious.  It's their warm, soft bread that really steps their sandwiches a notch above most others. Their salads are not so good so unless you're seriously allergic to bread or something, try a sandwich. \n\nBest of all, it's open 24/7 as it should be in this town!"

S'Earl of Sandwich. You were underrated to my taste.\n\nDon\'t know what all the rave & hype is about. Their food tastes the same as Subway\'s, if not worse. Y\'all must be all intoxicated while eating this shit cuz this place tastes OK when you\'re sober.\n\nI must admit the bean soup was really good though I was hella drunk while eating it. It was the only "good" taste that stood out. The line is definitely not worth the wait HAHA.\n\nProps to them for opening 24 hrs. That\'s probably how they make so much money...charging drunktards (like me that night) for multiple sandwiches. I came back to the hotel with two bags of 2 sandwiches & 2 soups. Wtf.\n\nIt\'s good munchies food but for lunch? Nahhh I\'d rather go to In n Out or Chinatown.'

I tried the full montagu and it was alright. I stole a few bites from the tuna melt (decent) and the original (pretty good) but the only lasting impression is their mustard spread and horseradish sauce. The tomato soup tastes like it was warmed up from a can. Also, my sister was in the mood for something simple and got the grilled cheese, it was like a roll of bread and the tiniest amount of cheese. Way too much bread. The Mac and cheese is good even though the way it's packaged reminded me of airline food which made me not want to try it but I'm glad I did as that was one of the best things I ate there."

S'3 things I love about this place:\n\n1) It\'s cheap enough to grab a delicious sandwich (way better tasting than a Potbelly\'s sandwich, and it\'s definitely under the $8 mark for one)\n\n 2) open 24/7 (best after a long sit at the poker tables and you need a break and food).\n\n3) it will spoil you to not eat at a Subway, Potbelly\'s or Quiznos. While the sandwiches aren\'t HUGE like a Jersey\'s Mikes sub shop, but hey, it\'s a SANDWICH, not some 24" long mayo-and-bacon loaded heart attack on white.  I would definitely hit this place up if I\'m walking along Planet Hollywood casinos or Bally\'s. \n\nThe only thing that would prevent me of giving me the fifth star is the limited amount of locations, especially if it\'s supposed to be a chain or franchised place.. who ISN\'T building one of these near by on the east coast?'

It was nice to eat somewhere affordable and not feel like you have to stuff yourself to get your money's worth at a buffet.\n\nEarl of Sandwich gets the job done and serves mouth-watering decent sized sandwiches.  The sandwiches are all perfectly balanced with its different components.  The bread is really fresh and the whole sandwich just melts in your mouth.  It's so warm and gooey--I'm craving for it already just reminiscing about it!\n\nThe salads were really good too.  I tried the Mediterranean Caesar Salad and it was really good as well.  Make sure to tell them to go light on the dressing since they tend to put a lot in there.    \n\nI also got to try their frozen lemonade which was pretty decent....but what makes it better is if you have extra vodka laying around....say at your room or in your pocket ...or your purse...Just splash some in there and BAM! you have a refreshing cocktail.\n\nEarl of Sandwich, I'll be back for you!"

Wrapped up in a foil sheet and piping hot, this baby-sized sammie was ready to be devoured. \n\nNow I know this place is not known for its organic hormone-free free-range glutenless vegan delicacies. No. Nope. Nope. Nope. But what the Earl of Sandwich will do IS absolve any problems that seem to leave you hanging. Their gut-bomb.com sandwiches are just what Dr. Vegas ordered for your sorry ass for having that last $30 drank at Hakkasan. \n\nThe line moves fast, which is just a GOD SEND in this town. A glimpse of luck if you will. Regardless of what you order from their large selection of sandwiches, salads, soups, or sides it\'s probably going to be damn delicious and ready for you within a few minutes of paying. \n\nDid you know that this chain was started by 11th Earl of Sandwich, John Montagu, to pay homage to the 4th Earl of Sandwich, who is of course the inventor of this glorious culinary combo. That just SCREAMS "LEGIT" in my book...somethat\'s also pretty rare here in Vegas. \n\nAnyways, the rating speaks for itself and I\'m glad my mom and I listened in. We won this one fo sho!'

They also have a selection of sides; I was debating between trying the parfait and potato salad.. I mean you really can't go wrong with either and now I wish I just got both but at the time their parfait hit the spot as I took it to go and ate it while walking around the strip!

S'Outstanding sandwich, everytime, period.  Best value for food in Vegas.  It is hard to explain in words just how fantastic these sanwiches are.  At first look, you might think it is just another Quiznos analog, or taste like any other toasted sub.  Quite the contrary.   They make all of their own bread, but unlike Subway who bakes their bread fresh,.. Earl of sandwich only bakes their bread partially.  The partially baked loaves are set aside, and wait for you to order.  Then the sandwich is assembled with high end, fresh and flavorful ingredients and sauces, and put through the chain oven.  It is at this time that the loaf of bread is fully, and freshly baked.  This leaves you with a perfectly light and fluffy, fresh baked bread that just can\'t be beat.  Its like bread straight out of the oven at home, and the corner stone of this amazing sandwich.  \n  Having lived in vegas for several years as well as making frequent trips back, we have eaten just about everywhere.  Yes, you can get steak and eggs at midnight for 2.99,.. yes you can go to amazing all you can eat buffets,.. but if you want some serious gourmet flavor for around 5 bucks a person, this place can\'t be beat.   \n   Between myself, my wife, and freinds and family we have brought here,.. we have collectively tried just about every sandwich on the menu.  The general consensus is, " this is the best sandwich I have ever eaten".  \n  The portion is just about right.  Nothing is included, so if you want chips, drink or dessert, you may grab them on the way to check out.   They have a nice variety of fresh fruit, salad, chips and cookies.  Then the standard soda fountain, self serve.\n   It is now open 24 hours, and though we have tried to beat the crowds by coming in late, there always seems to be a bunch of people eating there.  They do now have vibrating coaster pagers now.  This is nice, because you can find a spot to sit and wait it out.  Turn around of your order depends on how crowded it is, but as a general timeframe say, 5 minutes in line, order, then maybe 5-6 minutes until the order is up.\n   I have never had a bad experience here. They haven\'t messed up an order, and I have yet to receive a sandwich that was anything short of amazing.  Good job guys!'

S'How good can a sandwich be? My boyfriend said he had to take me to this "Earl of Sandwich" place in Planet Hollywood, and when we got to vegas, our suitemates already had sandwich wrappers everywhere.\n\nSo I got a guitar filled with alcohol at the PBR Rock Bar and went went across to Earl\'s. I got the BLT - BLT is my favorite sandwich and I judge all sandwich places by their bacon. You order, take your buzzer down the line and then pay and have a seat. \n\nThe sandwich was out fast, and for such a long line, there was seat readily available. Did I mention this is 24 hours?\n\nAMAZING. I went back another day and had the same thing, the bread is what makes it - crunchy on the outside but too doughy and filling... so good. It\'s good buzzed, drunk, or sober, just GOOD. I dream of this sandwich. Best BLT ever.\n\nThe tomato soup had garlic (I think) croutons floating in it which is awesome, and the chicken noodle was thick and very flavorful !'

S"Honestly, I expected more from Earl of Sandwiches because of the hype surrounding it.  We had the cannonball sandwich (meatballs) and the jerk chicken.  I preferred the jerk chicken with the roasted bell peppers.  I had a few bites of the Hawaiian BBQ, which I would pick again.  Given the chance to eat at Earl of Sandwiches again,  I would try the club or the original.  \nIf I'm in Vegas, I'm not going out of my way to seek it out otherwise, at least I know where to locate it if I'm in the mood for a sandwich.  Pluses - the line moves very fast, it's open late and lots of sweets to select from while waiting to pay."

Don't let the line discourage you, it's actually not too bad. But the sandwiches are oh so yummy!!\n\nActually, the first time I had a sandwich from here, I wasn't actually there. I had just landed in Vegas and went and partied up a bit and went back to my room at the Elara. My partner was hungry and told me that they would be back. I was like what is open at this time of night. Are you gonna catch a cab? Wait, they said. No sooner had I removed my makeup and dressed into the comfy clothes, back they were with the sandwiches. It was still warm. I bit into it and was in heaven. Or as close as I could get to heaven while being in Las Vegas! At the time, I attributed the satisfaction to all day travel and some great drank. Boy, was I wrong.\n\nCouple of days later, the partner wanted to place some bets at the sports book and asked if I wanted to grab some sandwiches to watch the game. I said sure, so I stood in line and got the sandwiches while they placed the bets. When we got settled back in the room, I took a bite of my sandwich and was so wowed! So they are as good when I'm sober AND drunk! That happens rarely, so I was just awed!!\n\nWhen we finally had to leave Las Vegas for home, we grabbed some sandwiches to eat while we wait for security at the airport. So convenient that this place is in the Planet Hollywood Hotel and Casino. Makes going home a little bit more bearable. Ok, that's a lie, but the sandwiches are very tasty and easy to eat with all your luggage your lugging around.\n\nI would like to say I've tried most of the sandwiches. And so far, every time we've stayed at the Elara http://www.yelp.com/biz/elara-a-hilton-grand-vacations-hotel-las-vegas#hrid:NPjBgidFouwIPjezynmpgg we've gotten sandwiches from here and they've all been yummers.

I thought the prices were reasonable and the food was dependable.  I was thrilled to see that I could get a Cobb salad and it was pretty good despite being somewhat different from other Cobb salads I've had.  It had no avocado but had cranberries and two types of cheeses which were in chunks in the salad (I actually kinda like the cheesy chunks).  It hit the spot and was good.\n\nMy friend had the Cobb salad in a wrap which she also enjoyed.  We were able to order and get food very quickly, and there is a coupon for 10% off in the book you get when you sign up for Planet Hollywood's players' club.  We had no problem finding a table.  The food is served in very handy little carrying bags that you could also take to go to another hotel or back to your room at PH, if so desired.\n\nI would return here if I was nearby.  It's inexpensive and dependable, and it's not a sit-down meal which makes it convenient.  I am not sure I would travel too far to get here but I would go here again if in the area.  I also will add that I should return to actually try a sandwich since that really does seem to be their main thing."

Hooters?), we finally decided to go across Las Vegas Blvd to see what we could find in the Miracle Mile at Planet Hollywood.\n\nLocated just inside the entrance, the Earl of Sandwich has a couple things going for it.  It's pretty cheap for the strip (around $6 for a sandwich) and for a cheap sandwich, the quality is pretty good.\n\nI had the Cannonballs (meatball sandwich), which was decent.  It's no Genovese's (see my review) back in Alhambra, but it was passable.  My gf had the Hawaiian BBQ, which was very good.  Ordinarily I don't like pineapple too much (strange, since my dad's side is from Hawaii), but in this sandwich with the bbq sauce, it was really good.\n\nThe portions are worth the money, but not a place to go if you're extremely hungry (that's what the Buffet of Buffets is for)."

S"Second time here. Grilled cheese for my four year old - ok, but not great. Italian for my wife - excellent sandwich. The original sandwich for me - good plain, but really good with a little dash of salt and some Grey Poupon - which they have available there.  In New York, this place would only rate a three or four star, but being that this is in Vegas, and it's relatively inexpensive, I will go ahead and give them all five stars.\n\nI would like to point out that this review was during my third trip to Vegas this year.  I don't particularly like Vegas, and all three of my trips were related to me needing to go to vegas for the sake of other people.  In general the food in Vegas at this price point is terrible, so I was really happy to find a casual, inexpensive, relatively not so artery clogging option.  \n\nYes, you can pay much more and go to a nicer restaurant, but that option is $30+ per person ($45+ if you want a drink or two).  At the $30+/$45+ (no booze/booze) price point, I've been to a couple of nice restaurants in Vegas and from the numerous favorable yelp reviews, I don't think decent to very good food at the higher price point is much of a challenge.  I don't know about great food like you can fine in San Fran or NY, but pretty good food nonetheless.\n\nAlso, I suggest that you Avoid the buffets, even the pricier & nicer one - i don't care which buffet you go to, the food will be meh at best.  I speak from experience, my fellow yelp friends.\n\nLast thing I want to point out about the Earl - there is a convenience store right around the corner where you can buy booze (hard liquor and beer singles) at a relatively good price.  If you want a drink, I would suggest that you pick it up at the convenience store before you get in line at the Earl."

We went to Earl of Sandwich for some Broccoli Cheddar. It was a VERY HEAVY soup. It was good and tasty. I would have liked some more broccoli chunks though.\n\nI had a full montague and it was delicious. I really liked the roast beef and the mustard.\n\nKalila had the canonballs and it was also delicious. The sauce seemed to be all over the sandwich wrapper instead of the meatballs, though. Overall, it was kind of dry. \n\nWe like that the bread is toasted, but after reading Misti's review, she makes a great point about how there are no other bread choices.\n\nBased off of the other times Kalila has eaten there:\nShe highly recommends getting a tuna melt sandwich and a tomato soup. Eating them together is reaaaaaallly good!\n\nOH, AND!\nYou can order a Grey Lemonade. It's Grey Iced tea and lemonade. Basically, an arnold palmer with a different type of iced tea. Whether or not you like it, depends on your taste buds. I know people who love it and people who can just tolerate it. It is something that they fill your cup behind a wall, but refills are free if you ask at the pick up area. Just try it to see if you like it or not.\n\n#foodcrew"

S'Never before have I felt so noble in Vegas for such a low price.  Would one rather have a $2000 Bottle Service @ Marquee, or 650 sandwiches from Earl of Sandwich (i.e. sandwiches for life)?  I would have to lean with the latter as every Earl\'s delcicious, piping-hot sandwich I\'ve had has been deliciOUS  If you\'re a fan of freshly baked bread that\'s magically soft and tender on the insides, yet baked and firm on the outside, you have found your nirvana.  Next, each sandwich is comprised of an ample amount of meat/lettuce/dressings/etc where each and every delightful bite is full of flavor and satisfaction.    If only they played EDM....Earl\'s would be borderline culinary bliss.\n\nTheir pricing is extremely competitive, especially for the Vegas Strip. Each sandwich is priced @ $5.99, with additional costs for double meat (really not necessary).  Another amazing aspect of Earls? IT"S OPEN 24 HOURS A DAY!!! Which means, one can wander over there drunk, intoxicated, and eat probably the best tasting sandwich in drunken memory and then even bring one back in case you happen to throw up before the night.  Unlike the other 24 hr joints, which tend to have long, inefficient waits, the line @ earls breezes through as they have an awesome system of those vibrating ringers that alerts you when your sandwich is ready.\n\nRecommendations: The Montagu, Hawaiian BBQ, Earl\'s Club (only if you like bacon as it has a prominent taste in the sandwich).  \n\nOverall, I think this how become my favorite place to eat in Vegas and I would gladly recommend anyone who throughly enjoys hot sandwiches to eat here.  They do have veggie options for those who have decidedly to foolishly deprive themselves of meat :P'

Frozen lemonade also hits the spot, just like the kind they serve at amusement parks but better. \n\nI went there with friends and they all got different sandwiches too and none of them were disappointed by what they got. Any choice on the menu will be good. \n$6 per sandwich, which may look small but fills you up."

That being said, I'm not sure why our sandwiches looked NOTHING like the yelp pictures customers have posted. I ordered the Earl's Club and it was pathetically put together. 80% barely toasted bread. Fillings were flavorless. Turkey was gross and processed. Bacon was virtually non-existent. It's possible that this was once a great sandwich place, but I may have missed the boat. Stars are for service which was super friendly but the food here is WEAK and seriously overrated."

The location is very nice too since it's so close to Planet Hollywood and other hotels/casinos in the strip. Another good point about this place is that they serve coffee and breakfast (the breakfast is only till 11:00 though)."

S"So I'll admit. I was totally skeptical of the yelp reviews - com'on nearly a 5-star star rating with over 3000 reviews for hot sandwiches!?!! Well I'm not really into sandwiches, but dang, the sandwiches at Earl of Sandwich are amazingly tasty and flavorful and perfectly warmed! Came here on a weekday, mid-afternoon. The line wasn't too bad. You place your order, pay and then they give you a little buzzer to let you know when your order is ready for pick up. We ordered Earl's Club and Hawaiian BBQ, along with sides of regular plain mac n cheese and mac n cheese with bacon. The sandwiches were amazing!!! The mac n cheese with bacon is a must-have. The turkey chili is not worth getting... It's a bit watery in my opinion. BUT, make sure you get a cookie for dessert. They have chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin, sugar and recently added peanut butter. I got an oatmeal raisin cookie and I swear it was the best oatmeal raisin cookie I've ever had. Their banana but muffin is pretty good, too!!Definitely check this place out when you're in Vegas. Totally worth the hype! :)"

S'I have recently visited this location with a group of friends to enjoy a dinner as we are all visiting the city in celebration of our school break. I have spoken highly of your restaurant to them as I had visited various locations including the one in Las Vegas at least twice. However to my misfortune this time the experience was DREADFUL. Out of 5 people I was the second person to order, my order consisted of a Caprese which after my whole party was done eating was handed to me damn COLD and quite UN_TASTEFUL. To my surprise, upon me approaching one of the employees to complain about the sandwich, he simply disregarded my comment and continued shuffling bags. I had to call to his attention twice before they acknowledge my presence, after they had heard my comment I was told that they did not give me my sandwich earlier because the "buzzers" were not working properly and I was excused. I, unhappy with the experience wanted to continue to voice my un-satisfaction with the service, such for which I was ignored. However the cashier did proceed to ask the employee if anything was wrong. I approached the cashier and tell her that the sandwich was extremely late and was also cold, comment she acknowledges which such disdain, I FELT EMBARRASSED to have mentioned it in front of the other customers. This was an absolutely terrible and embarrassing experience, I do not come to an establishment to be brushed-off or neglected as just another "assumed" drunk customer, much the less be PATRONIZED and ignored when trying to voice a complaint about the food or services provided. This was an incredibly terrible experience which left me a quite sour taste for this company which I had really enjoyed in the past.'

And a coke.\n\nGood:\n+ Food: So good. Everything I tried was so good. I need to try more. Also, the drinks are a self-serve station (meaning free refills yay!)\n     + The bread was the perfect amount of chewy, soft, crunchy, and flavorful. The cheese was ooey-gooey melty goodness.  The flavors that came all together was just amazing.\n+ Price: I don\'t remember. All I remember is that it\'s worth it. I think I ate this for "breakfast" (at 2pm) and "dinner" (at 2am).\n\nBad:\n- Lines are HUGE for this place. Why? Because it\'s sooooooo good.\n- Lots of seats, but lots of people = limited seating areas.

I can never go to Subway again. When I come back to California, I get depressed if I see a Subway.\n\nTheir sandwiches are so fresh and amazing. They have so many interesting choices like caribbean jerk chicken! From the times I went, each sandwich has not failed to disappoint.

S'Dont get me wrong, enjoyed the food at this place but i do believe it was over-hyped. I ordered the tuna melt with chicken tortilla soup and my bf ordered sthing else i forgot (sorry!) Although the tuna melt was delicious i just didnt think it was worth the 6bucks just b/c it wasnt amazing in my opinion and for size was a lil much. even though yes it is a bargain for food on the strip...and 3bucks for barely a cup of soup? gees...and there was hardly any chicken in this soup...but! it did taste good, i just wouldnt get it again. the people there are rude or seem just tired out...im sure theyre sick of tourists but cmon now if im saying "hello and thank you" to you when you never said either of those to me first...yeah sthings wrong there.\n\nanother day later during this same recent trip to vegas, my bf and i went clubbing at tao..and of course i was one...drunk, two- tired as fuck, three- hungry...so we had to resort to earl\'s since it is in our hotel and its open @2am. these two black chicks in front of us came back from clubbing as well (and i know this b/c when we girls are carrying our heels and walking around barefooted..its from clubbin\')..the cashier was flirting with them and i was getting annoyed bc i was fucking tired, drunk & hungry...and here is this dude with his mini dreadlocks tryna spit game while myself and the line wrapping around the corner are tryna get our food! poor guy didnt get a 2nd look nor their #\'s haha. so when we were finally next, we ordered one jerk chicken sandwich and a cup of chicken noodle soup. i know why did i order soup again? because for me it cures some of my drunkyness for an hr haha. plus i also wanted to see if another of their soup could redeem itself. jerk chicken was ok, wasnt amazing like some people had mentioned..i would say the red peppers helped that sandwich\'s ass out in making it taste at least good. soup was better than the tortilla soup surprisingly.\n\nnot saying its not worth the try, just dont expect so much from it :]'

S'I knew something was off about this location. :| Came on a Saturday evening to grab dinner and of course there\'s a line. We wait diligently as like the other 30-40 people in line. Out of nowhere two gargantuan couple comes waltzing in front of me and orders. Literally cuts the line and the cashier doesn\'t say anything. This happens again when my boyfriend and his group of friends was up when three other guys comes up to them, tries to use a "Have you seen my phone" ruse to cut in line. The cashier once again can see that the three guys were not there beforehand, yet decides to stay silent. Thank goodness the group decides to walk around them to order.\n\nWhat pissed me off was we tried telling management about it, it\'s not fair to all the other people waiting in line. The response they gave: they merely shrugged their shoulders and said "okay". #WTF. They could\'ve at least put line cutters on last or something. They didn\'t even seem to care that it was bothering other customers.\n\nNot to mention their service is terribly slow. We watched the only sandwich cutter take his sweet time cutting the sandwiches as other sandwiches piled up in the oven (since it\'s on a conveyor belt). It ended up being burnt. -_-\n\nIf it wasn\'t for the fact that this was the closet place to cheap eats near Vdara, probably wouldn\'t come here again.'

The Earl Club was amazing. There was a really strong bacon flavor and the roasted turkey went well with the melted swiss cheese. The Caribbean Jerk Chicken sandwich was also very good.

This place is open 24 hours which is fantastic and there is nothing better than to eat than their Original sandwich (roast beef) when you're walking around drunk/hyper-like.\n\nEvery time we've come here the line isn't too bad and the food is served fast.  It's always hot, so I feel assured that it's not sitting under a heat lamp in the back somewhere.  It's also cheap, which in Vegas, is rare.

S"I'm going from strictly memory of my Earl of Sandwich experience.  My fat Hawaiian friend recommended this spot and after building his creditability with the Pizzeria @ The Cosmopolitan, I gave in.  Earl's is pretty easy to find and is right across from the Sugar Factory.  The sandwich shop was pretty busy, but it could of been the holiday, 4th of July.\n\nThe menu is extensive and consists of hot sandwiches, salads & wraps, desserts, breakfast items, and beverages and smoothies.  I opted for a hot sandwich, more specifically the Caribbean Jerk Chicken.  The sandwich is subtle and includes grilled chicken, roasted red & banana peppers, and their signature spicy jerk sauce.\n\nThe sandwich was mouth watering delicious.  The chicken was nicely grilled and seasoned.  The lettuce, tomato, and peppers gave it that crunch, and their jerk sauce gave it that kick without overwhelming the overall taste. The food was awesome, but I do suggest ordering a large or two sandwiches, as I was left somewhat unfilled after my regular sized sandwich.  It's no five star sandwich but it's damn close."

We saw right away that there were 3 sandwiches (not 2) and we were missing the soup. How could they mix that up? We showed the staff our receipt and they gave us the soup.\n\nWhen we got back to the Cosmo to eat, we found that they had given us 2 of the originals (they basically made one of our sandwiches twice).

When I sat down to eat it though, I discovered I had a hair in my sammy. EWWWW! The workers there don't wear hair nets. \nGrossed out, I walked over to the cash register and asked for a replacement. They were busy, but very nice about it, and got my another one very quickly. \nThe bread was cruchy and soft at the same time, and I thought that was definitely the highlight of the meal. The BBQ sause was entirely way too salty. They were kind of skimpy on the chicken. However I thought it was a good sandwich overall, I liked how the pineapple, ham, and the sauce worked together and the crunchy bread gave it texture. \nI only came here cause I was in Vegas and there aren't THAT many cheap easy fast options.

Kinda wish I had read the reviews on what to order first, but I just went with what I was feeling at the moment, which was something not too crazy salty/heavy and I stuck with the Earl Club. Loved it! Your basic club sandwich, but with a chipotle-y sauce and bread that's so soft, warm, yet slightly crunchy that it makes me want to cry. Their bread is amazing! I don't know how they do it, but it reminds me of Mendocino Farm's bread where it looks like the roof of your mouth is going to get some torture scraping against the tops of the bread (which I hate!!), but noooo....surprisingly it's super soft and good!\n\nI also ordered the tomato soup, which I think might have been perfect for sharing because after half a sandwich, finishing the soup wasn't that easy--especially since it's hearty, creamy, and has crunchy bread croutons in it. I'm not usually a tomato soup person, but this really hit the spot.\n\nAlso thumbs up on the prices. Not gonna break your bank for being a major hot spot in Vegas. Love it!"

We particularly enjoyed their breakfast sandwiches, The only reason for the minus 1 star was the service was not friendly-but I didn't expect anything more so ...."

S"TOO LEGIT. Reallly good prices for vegas, open 24 hours, located in planet hollywood...and not to mention they know a thing or two about making good sandwiches. I'm going to make it a mission to try every sandwich on the menu. If you come here definitely pick up one of the toasted sandwiches. The bread is pretty damn good, artisan, baked in house i think. Personal favs are the caribbean jerk chicken and the holiday sandwich (limited time...turkey gravey stuffing cranberries...delicious). \n\nKEY TIP: get 2 sandwiches! save one for later...youll be sure to thank yourself for it when you stumble back to the hotel room drunk as hell at 4am! enjoy"

I was sober and very hungry and thus, enjoyed my Hawaiian sandwich very very much.  I thought that: \n\n1) there was a lot of ham and chicken in my sandwich\n2) the bread had that \'just baked\' feel - crispy/crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside\n3) the sauce was tangy and oh-so-good!\n\nI felt like I ate a Hawaiian pizza!  YUM.  I also thought my accompanying chocolate chip cookie was delicious.  (I bought a country apple muffin for my hubby and he *just* devoured it, pronouncing the muffin as "hey, that was really good!.")\n\nOne of the more affordable options on the Strip and dang, why is there only one location in Vegas, let alone NV?

S'I\'M SO SAD. Earl of Sandwich has definitely downgraded from the glory it used to be!\n\nI came here on my last trip to Vegas, only to find out that Earl is now only a shadow of his former self. \n\nLet me interject with some background history: I frequented Vegas when I lived in Southern California. When I say frequent, I mean at least once a month. I know Vegas like the back of my hand: I can tell you what hotels are located where, and what time each of the nightclubs\' guestlists close. I was very familiar with Earl\'s menu. Drunkenly slurring out an order for the Earl\'s Cobb wrap, debating over the potato salad in the fridge, with my heels in hand at 4 am in the morning - that was my THING!\n\nSo on my most recent trip, I happily approached the cashier at Earl\'s, announcing that I would like to order the Earl Cobb Wrap. This was what I had been looking forward to all night, post-clubbing. Not squeezing myself into a dress, not enjoying the live DJ performing at a million or billion dollar club or whatever, but shoving Earl\'s in my face drunkenly after a night of dancing. \n\nThen the cashier said the words that absolutely broke my heart: "We don\'t have the Earl Cobb Wrap".\n\nI stared agape at him. The wrap that I had eaten loyally for 4 years straight on my every trip was GONE?! Just like that?! \n\nI spent a while in disbelief, drunkenly lamenting my sadness to Mr.Cashier before reluctantly ordering a Chinese Chicken Wrap and making my way down the queue. \n\nWalking through the line, I brightened up at the thought of at least getting my potato salad. I peered into the refridgerator. And my spirits plummetted once again. What was once a generous portion of potato salad (think 6 oz) was now 2-3 oz! The same applied for the yogurt parfait - it was half the size it used to be! And surprise surprise, the prices were still the same original prices.\n\nBy the time I get to the front cashier (where customers pay), I was one sad, drunken lady. I shook the potato salad in Mr. 2nd Cashier,\'s face, demanding "WHY! Why did you make this smaller? What happened!!"\n\nMr. 2nd Cashier responded tonelessly (he was probably used to these reactions), "Corporate happened."\n\nWhen I received my wrap, instead of the wheat pita bread Earl\'s wraps used to use, it was some stupid flour tortilla. Dry and definitely did not soften the loss of my beloved Earl Cobb Wrap. Bleh.\n\nAnd so, I shake my fist as I angrilly write this review. Darn you, Corporate, darn you! How dare you take away what was once magical about Earl of Sandwich!'

S"Ohhh...I could just eat Earl's bread by itself for days....warm, soft, thick and carbo-licious! The stuff in the middle of the sandwich was just the cherry on top. =)\n\nI shared the sandwiches family style with my friends and we tried the the Original, the Full Montague and the All American. I chose the All American because love cranberry with turkey. So delish! The seasonal special was a another turkey sandwich with cranberries and the fixin's. I was tempted to try that too! \n\nAll the sandwiches were delicious and stuffed to the brim with meat and veggies. I'm  not sure which one I liked the best, but I found that the Full Montague and the All American tasted similar. The original had a stronger taste to it due to the horse radish sauce. I totally could have just ate half of a sandwich and been full. The portion size is good. For about $5.99 per sandwich it's a great deal! The lined moved super fast and the sandwiches came out super fast too. They have their system totally down. \n\nJust one thing to note, make sure that you check your recipe after you order and make sure it's what you really want. We originally ordered The Club, but the guy at the register put down the Full Montague on our receipt and we were unwrapping our sandwich when we noticed the mix up. \n\nGood CHEAP eat in Vegas!

S'$5.99 HOT SANDWICHES\n\nThat alone says a lot considering the overly inflated Vegas prices pretty much anywhere else you\'ll go. But you know what else is pretty cool? \n\nTHE ORIGINAL 1762: Freshly Roasted Beef, Cheddar Cheese + Creamy Horseradish Sauce   http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=RF2G1GIdQBuowR5CXppVkA\n\nIf it\'s called the original + it\'s the first thing on the menu, it\'s gotta be pretty good, right? And it was! ... I don\'t even like horseradish actually, but this sandwich was amazingly good. And yes, it was consumed not once but twice while somewhat relatively sober + so I know for sure that this sandwich is legitimately delicious with its thinly sliced moist meat, melty cheese... But what really makes the sandwiches here pop is actually the bread; a good sturdy roll that\'s toasted on the outside + soft on the inside but it\'s too thick that steals the show from the flavorful goods inside but rather complements them. \n\nOther perks to this place are that it\'s right on The Strip inside the Planet Hollywood hotel so you don\'t have to venture off to find a decent cheap meal + additionally, that it\'s located literally just yards from The Strip entrance at front of the hotel / the Miracle Mile shops. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=KT9yRyjLmgbbmm72dBq3dQ As someone who despises winding around for miles through casinos due to all the secondhand smoke, this location was the perfect pitstop for us + I\'d imagine for any drunkies wandering The Strip as well since it\'s open 24 hours. \n\nDon\'t be afraid of the line out front http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=LjjLhCDPTnzkt5g1NmRQGA; it moves fairly fast + gives you time to deliberate over their multiple good-looking options. A couple of my friends tried The Full Montagu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=RX13gt95IhW9qnsPNwYN4Q + The Earl\'s Club as well + said they were really good as well. The sandwiches are about maybe 8" long + they\'re cut in 1/2 so it\'s perfect to share when you need sustenance but don\'t want to be full. They come wrapped tight + in a little plastic bag so it\'s easy to take to-go or to eat in their dine-in seating area. \n\nDoesn\'t get too much better than this any time of day or night when you\'re looking for legit cheap, good food on The Strip in Vegas. Yea, it\'s just a sandwich shop so take this review into context, but it\'s a pretty damn good shop. For sure I\'ll be back.... + maybe to try one of their yummy-looking Ghirardelli chocolate brownies by the register, mmm...   =)\n\n\nMenu board of Hot Sandwiches: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DkYS3arLOhA8si5uUEmHOw?select=6G1HKUGrpTw6A3UG_3HkHw'

If you're anywhere near this part of the strip, staying at either the Cosmo, Bellagio, PH towers/Elara, or clubbing at Marquee, you're more than likely going to end up here at some part of the day.\n\nVery solid hot sandwiches, everything from the toppings to sauce is well balanced within and for $6 its quite the steal in Vegas. With their toasted bread, each bite is paired with a savory crunch along with their simple sauces, making it hard not to fall in love with what you're eating. I personally get the Full Montague when I swing by the first time since another future sandwich is inevitable. Stand out sandwiches include the original and club, and if you're feeling adventurous go with the Caribbean jerk sandwich. Only item I'd skip is the meatball/Cannonball sandwich, its pretty standard and nothing to write home about.\n\nLines can be pretty long but the it moves fast and there's plenty of seating, making this 24/7 spot a great place to grab a bite as you're shuffling your sore feet back to your room."

S"As a local, it would make ZERO sense for me to go to Planet Hollywood for a sandwich. So my 5 star rating shouldn't be misconstrued as me saying I would frequent them all the time, but rather based on convenience and price compared to what you typically find in a Las Vegas casino. At $6 you would be hard pressed to find a better sandwich on the Vegas strip. Is it the best sandwich I have ever had? Certainly not. However, with warm bread, tasty meat and relatively quick service... you can't beat Earl of Sandwich. Added bonus is that it is directly across from the Sports Book... grab a sandwich and go sit and watch a game. \nI agree with Misti that they have a major lack of options for not only bread but toppings and sauces. No oil and vinegar? How does a sandwich shop not have oil and vinegar?\nSandwich is not overly filling, which could be either good or bad depending on how you look at it. Heading to see Peepshow? Probably don't want to sit through that on an overstuffed stomach! Grab some Earl and you will be good to go!\nI order the Full Montague (I believe) which has turkey and roast beef.

It\'s tender, ultra moist, and just tasted like it was meant to exist in a perfect universe. \n\nThe Earl\'s Club was good, but I felt like the saltiness of the bacon was a little off with their "Sandwich Sauce" (which looked like thousand island salad dressing).\n\nThe Original 1762 is a jackpot sandwich of their stellar roast beef, cheese, and creamy horseradish sauce: A rich gooey orgasm.\n\nTuna Melt: Let\'s be honest, fat = flavor, and this sandwich is a saucy mayonnaise tuna-bomb.\n\nHawaiian BBQ is great for those who love things like Hawaiian pizza, but in sandwich form. The science behind the sweetness of the pineapple and the saltiness of the ham has never failed anyone.\n\nThe Caprese is something I personally hold dear to my heart, that combination of ingredients is what I\'m all about. Sadly, I can\'t recall any presence of the tomato. Considering this cost the same as all the other sandwiches and has zero meat, I\'d think twice about ordering it again.\n\nLastly, but definitely not least, the Best BLT sandwich is without any debate THE BEST BLT SANDWICH I HAVE EVER EATEN. My cousin Bryan V. has spoken of it fondly, but now I know what he\'s talking about. It\'s just a savory kingdom of bacon cooled by tomatoes and brought to life by the richness of the mayonnaise.

I suggest this place if you want to grab a quick meal and don't want to spend much (especially in Vegas).  There's also a large seating area so you can also enjoy your sandwich right then and there."

S'If only Earl was a lot closer... 264.8 miles apart to be exact and it hurts because Earl is so darn good and I\'ve been craving it since the day I left Vegas. :(\n\nTo be honest, I didn\'t know about Earl\'s until last year. My guy friend told me about Earl of Sandwich in Vegas and he was ranting about how it\'s the best sandwich on earth. Intrigued, I signed up for Earl\'s club immediately and decide to give it a try next time I went to Vegas, which was this past weekend for my 23rd birthday. :)\n\nI got to Earl\'s on Saturday around 12pm and boyyyyyy, the line was pretty long. But no need to worry because the workers there are super speedy and you\'ll have your food in due time! I knew which sandwich I wanted in a heartbeat, "The Full Montagu". Freshly roasted beef, turkey, aged swiss and cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and mustard sauce. Mmm, just thinking about it makes my mouth water! I want some NAO.\n\nAnyway, Earl\'s sandwiches are nicely toasted, which makes the outside crisp yet they somehow manage to keep the bread moist and soft in the inside. Cheese are hot and stringy while my mustard sauce gave a nice kick to the sandwich. I added some pepper that they had on their dining table, which wasn\'t just regular pepper. It was a little bit herby and tasted bombbbb. My best friend got herself the "Hawaiian BBQ" and she also loved her sandwich, which means a lot knowing she\'s a picky eater hah\n\nAnd the best thing about my first Earl of Sandwich experience was that it was FREE (not that it\'s expensive to begin with). Yay, thanks Earl\'s club for my freebie coupon! I\'ll be satisfying my craving next weekend when I\'m in Vegas again!\n\nOH, ps., did I mention this place is open 24/7? You deserve A+++ in my book. :D'

S'This is a pretty good and cheap place to eat in Vegas! Me and my friends were staying at Planet Hollywood and we all came here twice, the first time when we all took a nap after our long ass drive from Riverside, and house before going back.\n\nIts a simple fast food restaurant concept. You go in line, make your order, and they give you one of those beeper things when your order is ready.  Then you eat your sandwich at the seating area near the casino or wherever you please.\n\nThe sandwiches are pretty good, I tried 3 of them at my first visit. I had the Italian, Caribbean Jerk, and the Full Montague (i believe). The Caribbean Jerk was my favorite out of the three. What makes the sandwiches good is the toasted and warm bread. Pretty good sandwich for $6, and a good portion as well.\n\nAlso, lastly I would like to mention that the Ice Cream sandwiches they serve are really good as well. My friend and I got one when we were stumbling across the Miracle Mile Shops drunk with our friends.... it was soo good and it was huge... only for ~$3.  \n\nDefinitely recommend to anyone going to Vegas, on a budget but hungry for some good food. Oh yeah 24 hours!!'

This is a fantastic deal for a quick bite to eat, quick service and delicious sandwiches.\n\nSince I knew that a single sandwich wouldn't be able to curb a Vegas sized appetite I added on the Tomato Soup which of course is the perfect compliment to any delicious sandwich.\n\nI went for the Full Montagu and Lauren V. ordered the Caprese sandwich.  If memory serves me correct I don't think we put down our sandwich after the first bite nor did we share with each other.  That leads me to believe that both sandwiches were amazing.\n\nEasy solution for anyone thinking about coming here: just do it.  It's a steal for the quality of food."

Right in the heart of the Planet Hollywood hotel sits this cheap ($5.99 per sandwich) little shop pumping out sandwiches as fast as they can.  \nI rocked the "Cannonballs"(meatball) and the "Hawaiian" (bbq chx) sandwiches and was overly impressed at how simple and amazing these were.  \nThe reason that is doesn\'t get the 5th star from me is a matter of simple economics.  "If the line is long, prices are too low!"  This place fits that phrase exactly.  Its possible to see a 100-150 person line at 3am at this place!!!  Even with a fast moving line, lunch still took around 45 minutes to get!  They should really consider raising their prices just a tad...even just $1 or $2 a sandwich because its a little obnoxious that the only affordable place around that hotel is so crowded.'

I had the Earl Club Sandwich; it was so good, typical insides.. I think it was turkey + bacon + condiments. My friends tried the Holiday Turkey Sandwich; it is THANKSGIVING IN YO MOUF. Seriously; turkey, cranberry sauce, gravy. I really like how they slightly toast your buns.. I also wish they could be bigger, but oh well. My girl friends and I ate half before pregaming and ate the 2nd half after clubbing LOL so it was practically like 2 meals!

Turkey breast, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and mayo on the Earl's soft, freshly baked bread. YUM! \n\nThe line moves fairly quickly. You order your sandwiches (or salads or whatnot) at the first register, then move down the line and pick up sides, desserts, or drinks, then pay at the end where you're given a buzzer that alerts you when your food is ready. \n\nCan't wait for the Anaheim outpost to open!"

What else could you ask for? \n\nBreakfast was $3.99 for an egg, cheddar, and ham sandwich on  warm, soft, toasted bread. The bread really makes their sandwiches. \n\nLunch we had the creamy tomato soup ($3.99) which was great. It really was creamy with a nice amount of herbs, garlic and croutons. For sandwiches we tried the Italian (awesome), the club (great), the Full Montagu (good), and the Caprese (tasty, but not my favorite compared to the others). $5.99 for those.  Once again, the bread makes it.\n\nWhat's really cool is everything is packaged to go (including the soup) so it's easy to carry back to the room or to find a place to sit as they have quite a bit of seating.\n\nFor tasty, cheap eats, this is a must stop."

They pack the sandwich full of meatballs and marinara sauce, with lots of gooey mozzarella cheese! The meatballs are juicy and the sauce is really flavorful. Mmmm its so warm and delicious in your tummy, especially at 3am, when you're freezing in a cold air-conditioned hotel. Last time, I also got the broccoli cheese soup with my sandwich.

S"I I initially didn't want to come here because the bf used to eat here for lunch and had told me it 'wasn't worth waiting in that long ass line.' So i thought eh..I'd probably only come here if I was close by. And what do you know..I decided to go to Urban Outfitters this weekend and I no longer had an excuse not to eat here. So here's the rundown of our experience:\n\nThe staff was organized,fast, and friendly. We didn't wait for our food for a long time, probably because it wasn't that busy. We sat on a table that was oddly placed by itself with one other table. And the food? Man I scarfed it down so fast I was almost ready to get another one..but opted to get potato salad instead. The sandwich I got was the tuna melt..minus the cheese, so it was basically a tuna sandwich. The bread was warm,crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. My only complaint was that they could've been a little more generous with the tuna, but it was no biggie. Oh and that potato salad was  oh so good. The bf got The Original which he actually enjoyed. He said it was a lot better than last time but could've used more au jus. \nAll in all, we spent under 18 bucks, including water, and was fully satisfied with the meal. Would I say this is the best tuna sandwich I've ever had? Probably not. But the best tuna sandwich I've had in the strip so far? Absolutely!"

Yelpers were right on with this place!\n\nI ordered The Earl\'s Club (roasted turkey, bacon, swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and their sauce) and it was perfection!  Bread was crunchy and warm and everything in it was good!  The bf ordered Caribbean Jerk Chicken (grilled chicken, roasted red and banana peppers, and spicy jerk sauce) and he enjoyed it too!  I took a bite out of it and it really was good!  I\'m sure the other sandwiches are good too!  I just wish they served fries with it hahaha.  I\'d definitely come back here though!

S'This is by far, my FAVORITE SANDWICH place in the whole country (I think).  Too bad there are no locations near Orange County yet. But I think this chain originated from the original family where the word "Sandwich" gets its name...so, you know it has to be a good sandwich.  Every time I go to Vegas, I make at least one stop here.  I usually get their original and have them add tomato on it. The bread and roast beef are very good and tasty.  I have been going here for about 3 years now and never tire from the taste. If you want a light meal and are tired of the buffets, you should stop here when in LV. And this place is now 24 hours so that\'s a BIG plus for me!'

S"In my view, yet another overhyped restaurant. Earl of Sandwich is a glorified Subway. \n\nThe Food: The chips are greasy and not particularly special. The chicken tortilla soup is pretty standard, the kind of soup you'd expect at your local Panera Bread. The chicken mac'n'cheese was actually quite delicious, with a crunchy texture owing to the crumbs they throw on top (mmm mmm mmmm). And the sandwich itself? Nothing special. I got the chipotle avocado chicken sandwich: The bread was whatever-white-bread, the chicken seemed ok, but not explosive, and the big chunks of avocado were pretty good and fresh. \n\nPrice: Dirt cheap. Under $7 for a sandwich. I understand for the price it may be decent enough. But this is not nearly as good as Ike's in San Francisco. \n\nOverall, this may be a good place to check out if you and the squad are nursing a hangover on a Sunday morning, but I wouldn't go here otherwise. Also, the lines can apparently get pretty huge.\n\nIn the near future, I expect this place to explode into a national chain, losing whatever little cache it had in Vegas as a stop-over spot for hungover peeps."

S'We need this damn restaurant in Southern California! I hate the fact that I\'ll have to travel to Las Vegas or fly out to Texas or the East Coast to get a sandwich from the Earl.\n\nThe web site claims that the Sandwich family (the same family line of the Earl who invented the sandwich), a restaurateur, and a dude by the name of Earl, created this franchise. It\'s easy to brag when you can honestly say that you invented stuffing things between bread. The chain also has the blessing of the 11th Earl of Sandwich and have a charter on the home page of their website. That\'s such great marketing. \n\nI know what you\'re thinking: "franchise" is a dirty word, especially on Yelp!. But no, this is a good sort of franchise, along the lines of Chick-Fil-A or In-N-Out or some other hyphenated chain.\n\nYou\'ll notice that they have images of 18th century individuals and a mug of the Earl himself on the soda cups of the restaurant. There\'s a Samuel Adams-esque quality about the place. \n\nThe sandwiches here are not too large, but the flavors stand out and ingredients are fresh. The bread is amazing, firm, but soft when you bite into it. The spreads were very unique, a cross between a honey mustard and barbecue sauce. I ordered the Earl\'s Club sandwich and I was very pleased to find that the turkey was moist, instead of dry and salty.\n\nI would say that this franchise is a cross among Corner Bakery, Panera and Lawry\'s Carvery. They give you a buzzer (at least at this location) and you come back to pick up your sandwich when it\'s done. Even though the sandwiches take a little longer to make, it\'s well worth it and you can definitely taste the quality. \n\nThis particular location is in the Miracle Mile shops in the Planet Hollywood hotel on the Strip. It\'s like the first thing you\'ll notice when you enter the mall from the south entrance. The seats spill onto the mall corridor and always seem to be crowded, the latter definitely being a good sign of good shit.\n\nSo this great place, along with Dunkin\' Donuts, are institutions that I have to hit up whenever I\'m in Sin City. I don\'t care what it takes, write a damn petition to the Earl himself and have him set up shop on this far-flung former colony I call western America.'

I wish there was one of these near my house!\n\nEvery time I'm in Vegas I always stop at Earl for lunch - I stick with the Earl's Club - but I've tried the full montague, the hawaiian bbq and several others and they're all delicious.  Oh, make sure you get the sauce on your sandwich, usually I never get sauce or spreads on my sandwiches because they're mostly loaded with fat but this sauce is awesome - it's the only place where I don't tell them to leave it off.\n\nI guess this place recently became popular, I've been stopping here for a few years and it was never all that busy.  I was there this weekend and all of a sudden there were huge lines.  Normally I hate standing in lines, but their sandwiches are so good that I thought it would be worth it....\n\nBottom line - this is a great lunch spot in the middle of the strip and the sandwiches are all awesome.  Apparently you need to be ready to stand in line now though..."

S"AWESOME SANDWICHES!!! \n\nWe ordered three sandwiches for three people. The Carribean Jerk, Tuna melt, and Roast Beef. All were delicious but my favorite was the tuna melt. I couldn't get enough. Once i finished my half of the roast beef. We all traded to get a different taste.  The tuna melt was nice and hot. That familiar tuna taste was delicious. It didn't even taste heavy like so it was just perfect. I think it is the bread that makes the sandwich. It just so tasty and just enough crunch (not so hard that it scratches the roof of my mouth). All together with the tuna and cheese is amazing. Mouth drooling right now. So good. The Carribean Jerk chicken was delicious as well. Chicken was plenty, moist, and not tough to eat. The peppers: red and yellow made the sandwich giving that jerk taste. Fantastic. The roast beef was alright. I wasn't such a fan of it. It was alright. I think it needed more flavor or something. It didn't leave an impression on me compared to the tuna melt and the carribean jerk. \n\nI love that Earl of Sandwich is affordable and ummm open 24 hours. I wish we could have stopped by before we left. Sad, we didn't But it is ok. Next time. Maybe it'll be a late night sandwich every night we are there. I'm so looking foreword to it. \n\n\n\n-This is a must GO!!\n\n*Drool*"

Their sandwiches blow every other sandwich chain out of the water.  Yes, I'm talking to you Subway and Quiznos.  They use high quality, fresh ingredients and everything is made to order.  And at $5.99 a sandwich, it's a steal!\n\nI used to think the Full Monagu was the best, but I've come to realize that THE ORIGINAL is the way to go.  Freshly roasted beef, cheddar and creamy horseradish sauce on their signature hot, toasty artisan bread.  *drool*  Don't worry, the horse radish isn't overpowering at all.  I also like the tuna melt, but wasn't really a fan of the Caribbean jerk chicken.

When my tummy notified me that it was lunchtime, I didn\'t have to search far to find a quick grub spot; I was standing right in front of an ad for Earl of Sandwich! Well, that was effortless, thank you Universe.\n\nMy Caprese Salad & a fountain root beer cost less than $9. I so appreciated the very appropriate portion--just enough for one moderately hungry girl--as some portions in Vegas tend to err on the side of REE-diculous. The tomatoes & mozzarella were fresh, but the salad was kind of drowning in its vinaigrette. Overall, it was un-special & really kind of "meh" but I can\'t knock a place that serves $5.99 salads & sandwiches.\n\nWon\'t be a stop on *my* next trip to Vegas, but if you\'ve just lost your shirt at the blackjack table, *you* may want to stop by this wallet-friendly Planet Hollywood eatery.'

Fine by me! I'm usually one of them! But the line does move quickly, and the eating area is clean. It's really not a bad spot to sit and enjoy the food with a few friends. The arrangement of the eating area makes it a little hard to cater to a larger group (if you move tables you block off the walkway, trashcans, etc).\n\nI can't wait to return to Vegas and give this place another try.

They have some tables for seating, and since most people come and go fast, it isn\'t that hard to find seating.\n\nService:\nMostly service is consisted of the cashiers and the sandwich makers. There isn\'t much to say about the customer service for the tabling because that doesn\'t really matter here.\n\nFood:\nAmazing sandwich! I got the hot turkey sandwich because I wanted to try out the cranberry sauce and stuffing since one of my favorite sandwiches is the Bobbie at Capriotti\'s of Culver City. Man... the sandwich at Earl surpassed my past experiences with that kind of sandwich elsewhere! It was very balanced and did not sog up the bread, but it kept it moist at just the right amount. The balance kept the flavor in without an over dryness of bread. My friends got other hot sandwiches and it seemed everyone liked their sandwiches. Some came by again the next day!\n\nOverall: 4/5\nGood place for sandwiches, you should definitely try this place for a small bite when in Vegas.'

Another plus about Earl's is that they are open 24 hours, which means when you are done drinking and gambling for the night, you will definitely be able to enjoy these delicious sandwiches.

I\'m glad they didn\'t name it Duke of Hoagie too.\n\n\nEarl of Sandwich, I salute you.... twice!'

S"Hrmph. I came in with very high expectations and Earl of Sandwich fell a bit short.\n\nOn the way back to the OC, we got an assortment of sandwiches - the grilled ham and swiss, full montagu, original and the earl club.\n\nMy fav out of all 4 was the ham and swiss (although the one at Society Cafe is 100 x better!) I wasn't a huge fan of the full montagu (it tasted overly salty and the meat was kind of bland) or the other sandwiches. They definitely do not warrant the high cost of the sandwiches (close to $10 for one!) or all the hype that this place gets. I mean, the bread is better than average but the other ingredients seem run of the mill.\n\nMeh, just meh."

It's located in the Planet Hollywood shopping mall. We literally spent an hour trying to find this place since we thought it was located in MGM Grand, New York New York, or Monte Carlo. \n\nThe sandwiches are really delicious! I love how the bread is toasted. MmMm..We had the Caribbean Jerk Chicken and the Original. The jerk chicken sandwich had some sweetness to it due to the jerk sauce and the roasted red peppers. It wasn't spicy. I was actually surprised with the Original sandwich. I'm not usually a fan of roast beef with horseradish sauce, but the flavors worked well. The horseradish wasn't overpowering.  The sandwiches were $5-$6, so it is definitely a cheap eats."

When I heard they had put one in the Miracle Mile shops, I couldn't wait to try it again!\n\nWe went this past Sunday night at 2:30 (ish) am and had it takeout in our rooms in bed, breakfast in bed style. I had The Full Montagu and my boyfriend had the Cannonballs (meatball). It was just as good as I remembered.\n\nTheir sandwiches are simple, but that is what makes them so good. And at least with the warm sandwiches, they are amazing at making the bread crispy on the outside but gooey on the inside.   \n\nEarl is also pretty affordable, which is nice since Vegas can get a tad pricy.

It's definitely one of the cheaper items to get in Vegas and can fill you up relatively well. But what really makes Earl's so special is the bread and how it's toasted. I honestly don't know what they do that makes it so good, because it just looks like that roll it through just any regular ole rolling toaster oven! Whatever they do, it works and it makes the sandwiches prety awesome.\n\nThe full montague was one of my faves. Good thing it's open 24/7 because it's great to get as drunk food after a night out on the Strip. \n\nFind me here again? Definitely."

S"Tucked inside the Planet Hollywood Casino, the Earl of Sandwich has received quite the praise from the Yelp community.  However, there is nothing entirely unique about what in my mind really amounts to something that I wouldn't be surprised to receive at Potbelly's or Quizno's.  Sure, Vegas needs cheap food as well, and Earl of Sandwich certainly qualifies.  However, for all the people who are practically nutting about a sandwich that uses good bread and good meat in a wholly predictable manner, I'm just going to have to say that I'm missing the allure entirely.  \n\nI ordered the Full Montague as a hangover cure following a night of extravagant drinking.  It's basically a roast beef and turkey sandwich lined with cheddar and swiss cheese.  Condiments?  A row of lettuce and tomatoes are included along with a line of mustard.  \n\nThat's really it.  There isn't anything magical about it at all.  I'm not going to dock it for my moderate disappointment (after all, it absolutely housed Marilyn's Cafe which was at a similar price point), but I'm not going to pretend it was something more than an average experience.  I'd go here again if I wanted something fast and cheap."

Their bread was chewy and tender.  full mantagu and original has juicy roast beef and tuna was also good flavor. Only the earl's club tasted like ordinary sandwich.  Everything was really good though. \nIf you like horseradish sauce, you have to ask extra horseradish sauce at cashier for no charge.  It will make your taste bud happy for sure.  \n\nLocated in Planet Hollywood. (our group walked about 15 min to try only this place and it was worth it.) \nService is friendly."

Sandwiches are a great price for the taste (and for being on the Las Vegas Strip) -- $6-8.  There's also a variety of drinks, desserts, snacks, soups and a kid's meal.\nI tried the caprese sandwich, tasted great.  Ordered an Earl's Frozen Lemonade.  It was very very sweet, way too sweet.  Felt like I was drinking lemon syrup.  It was under $3 and I was dehydrated, so I didn't waste too much money.  I also ordered a soup, which is also at a low price of about $3."

This shop will definitely make us keep coming back for more.  \n\nIt's the perfect size too!  I think that the freshly baked bread they use is what definitely makes this sandwich stick out.

It is definitely a scrumptious "QUICK BITE".\n\nI ordered the chicken avocado & my husband ordered the full montagu.  First of all, I think any sandwich panini pressed makes it superior.  My husband and I were very quiet while we endulged on our sandwiches.  We didn\'t even offer the other a taste.  I would\'ve came back here another time but I wanted to try out other places while we were in Vegas for 4 days.\n\nThere should be more places like this in east coast.'

S'I need to gripe. \n\nPrevious to my most recent visit, this was my go-to spot for a breakfast of Greek Salad w/ grilled chicken. I would have easily given it 5-stars.\n\nIt\'s cheap and the only place within walking distance that even sells salads this early in the a.m. (they\'re open 24-hours), not to mention that I actually really ENJOY eating them. \n\nSo I\'m staying across the street at the Aria and I make the trek through City Center, across the bridge, through treacherous construction and finally through the PH casino all for this salad.\n\nI didn\'t get my salad. \n\nThe girl behind the counter said they weren\'t available. I assumed they were out of a vital ingredient since I\'ve ordered this salad plenty of times at this hour. She said they might have the salad later that afternoon but I could order a wrap instead. I was mystified by this since they were the same ingredients but in a pita??? After pressing the issue I discovered that the reason she couldn\'t sell me the salad was they were out of the proper container. Seriously.\n\nI asked if I could order it and have it served in cups or any other container they had available, I just really wanted the f***ing salad. She had the nerve to look at me like I was crazy!\n\nShe obviously isn\'t going to win any awards for creative problem solving but she not only lost a sale that day (and the whole rest of the weekend!) but she lost 2 stars as well.\n\nNote to Management: I still really dig your food and will most definitely visit again but you may want to have a meeting with your employees regarding customer satisfaction and thinking "outside the box".'

Some may say there is too much bread when they first look at it, but once you sink your first bite into it, there is a perfect ratio of meat to bread, and the bread is perfectly toasted, not too hard, not too soft.\nPricing is reasonable.\nAdvice, eat it the way it was meant to be eaten.. unless of course you're allergic or will die at the taste of mustard."

For whatever reason, I love to try new buffets and try different dishes that I would never order off the menu. It's like a fun adventure for me.\n\nThe Wynn Buffet is top notch! The wait wasn't that bad, pretty standard at about half an hour. $40 per person is a little steep, but hey! You're in Vegas so expect to shell out some cash. Walking in you will see a whole bunch of colorful flowers, it's a very feminine atmosphere.\n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful, she always checked in with us and removed any plates and refilled our drinks the moment it gets half way, excellent service!\n\nWhenever I go to a new buffet, I always walk around and check out the food selection before I even grab a plate, and that's because I want to keep a mental note of the items I really want to eat, versus the I'm not sure but I'll try it cause it's there kind of dish.\n\nI was very impressed with the cleanliness of the buffet line, it was almost spotless, the food looked beautiful, almost too beautiful to eat. The presentation was classy and made everything looked delicious. By the time I sat back down at the table, I had the following on my plate: prime rib, king crab legs, red snapper, chilean sea bass, shrimp cocktail, mussels, skirt steak, mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, asparagus. All very good, they had a lot of seafood choices and a lot of lamb, which I didn't have any cause I wasn't feeling it that day, but I'm sure it was good.\n\nBy this time I've opened the portal to my second stomach and I'm ready to hit the dessert bar. I have 2 words for you: creme brule Oh Sweet Jesus it was good! I could have eaten at least 2 more plates of it, but I had to leave room for... I have another 2 words for you: homemade ice cream, OK that's 3 words whatever, there's nothing I love more than ice cream, unless it's HOMEMADE ice cream. So rich and creamy, the coffee ice cream will give you chest hair, but it's worth it lol\n\nI'd like to add that they have restrooms just for the buffet guests, you don't have to walk outside to the casino and find a restroom, very convenient. Also, the stalls are very private, it's like you're in your own little world in there, you don't see that very often in public restrooms. You can tell they spent a lot of time considering all aspects of this restaurant and it really shows. This will be my new goto place for a Vegas buffet."

S"8/14/10 \nAfter much deliberation we decided to head out to the buffett for a nice brunch...The Wynn is always a beautiful place to walk around...the air quality is even nice there...versus...the thick cigarette filled smoke in most other casinos...there was virtually no wait in line at 11am...I got the buffett with the unlimited champagne/mimosa/bloody mary for $7 extra and the b got the regular buffet...we were seated in the garden area which is by far the best area to eat in as it has direct sunlight....\n\nIt was our first time there and we were pleasantly surprised and liked all that they had to offer..it was truly more than any person could eat...so we ate in moderation and really enjoyed not going to overboard...the dessert selection especially was pretty nice...\n\nI have to say it's definitely a place to go try out at least once...if you wanna try out a top rated buffet...we thoroughly enjoyed it!"

S"The Buffet at the Wynn is pretty good... for a buffet. It is one of my favorites in Vegas. It is also decorated nicely with lots of flowers. \n\nThey have a nice assortment of food to choose from, all presented in brightly lit displays. There are separate displays for salad, soup, seafood, meat, etc. I ate a whole bunch of crab legs and cocktail shrimp. I would've tried the prime rib, but I was too full. \n\nThey also have a nice assortment of desserts, including crepes, gelato, creme brulee, and a bunch of different cakes. Yum!"

I think I had more desserts than my main meal. \n\nWaiters are pretty attentitive. They were quick to clear our plates for more, refill our drinks ect.\n\nThere's usually a line here so you might want to come a tiny bit before peak time."

S"This was probably the best buffet i've ever had but im not a buffet person so take that with a grain of salt. At $50-ish per person, it isn't cheap but it came comped with my room so that made it a no brainer.\n\nThey've got the typical variety of food but it was all largely very good quality stuff. \n\nWhere as at a typical buffet you might have a salad bar - a Cesar salad and some other run of the mill salad with a bunch of vegetable bins -  here you have your choice of quinoa salads, beet salads, asian chicken salad, etc. Basically its a buffet but the dishes are things you might order at a higher end restaurant so it isn't just higher quality ingredients.\n\nThe crab legs line was out of control, people were loading their plates up to the top with crab legs and then holding the mountain down with the other hand to prevent the legs from flying off. Kind of hilarious..i mean...you can come back for more sooo whats the deal...? \n\nThe dessert station is pretty sweet. Lots of little shooters and little cakes so you can try a dozen different ones without feeling like a fat turd after wards. They were mostly very good too!\n\nThe sushi/sashimi was the only bummer. I don't even remember seeing any sashimi and the rolls were strangely tiny with a tiny bit of fish in there. I ended up skipping it and you should too. No point in filling up on a roll of rice and seaweed.\n\nOverall I wouldnt mind coming back here."

It is sure to induce a "food comma" upon completion of your experience. There are just too many wonderful things to try. I felt like an idiot balancing the copious amount of desserts back to the table. But it was all totally worth it.

S'I\'ve eaten at the Wynn Buffet at least 6x now and I would say its one of the most overrated buffets of all time. Why do I keep coming back you ask? Simply because, I get to eat there for free. I\'ve paid to eat here my first time, and I would never pay again for the ridicoulous price. For $10-15 more, you could easily enjoy fine dining at any steak house in Las Vegas! I don\'t consider myself cheap when it comes to food, but I want bang for my buck, and you definitely won\'t get that here.\n\n-Crab legs are cold and there isn\'t a steamer available. \n-The desserts look wonderful, but everything taste bland IMO.\n-Long lines (thanks to 1000+ Reviews)\n-Kobe beef sounds like one could actually get a lot of their money here, but the way they prepare their meat, their wasting their supposed "Kobe" beef.\n-The Dim Sum and Mexican dishes were also poorly executed.\n\nEverything was edible, but it definitely does not live up to its hype. The long lines are fooling everyone.'

When I was younger, I could eat and eat and eat but on this last trip to The Buffet, not that much looked appetizing to me. This most recent trip was for Sunday Brunch (~$35 after tax/tip.) Not sure if there is a kids price but there is no seniors price haha.\n\n- 70 minute wait (we got there around 10:40am and the line wasn't even out the normal buffet area yet; when we left at 1:30 it wrapped around the corner for who knows how long)\n- you could pay $15 per person to by pass the line, ha\n+ $5 more gets you unlimited bubbly\n+ great servers and friendly staff (very attentive with clearing plates and bringing drinks)\n- what's up with changing out the breakfast items at 1:30pm? did the price change?! I heard breakfast was only $20 hmm\n- the quality seems to go down each time I come here (ie., the crab legs were previously frozen and old; the prime rib was cooked medium and dry; the crepe was premade and cold)\n+ the ice cream/sorbet is always good and I like that they change out the flavors (ie., egg nog was delicious)\n- this is not about brunch but when we came to the dinner buffet last year people got sick, very sick (cough cough)"

We arrived later on a Friday and rather than try to get into a nice restaurant that we could not make reservations for b/c we did not know when we would get into town my wife suggested the Wynn buffet.  She said there was great reviews on yelp for it so against my better judgment we tried it out.  I was completely embarrest the food was so bad. The service was great better than any other buffet I can remember eating at before but again the food ahhhhh!!!!!! I never finished a single thing I took I would have rather eaten in n out burger!!!

Seafood, prime rib, baby ribs, mexican food, asian (what? Congee?? really!), fried chicken, seared salmon (droools), fish, veggies.. hmmmm not to mention..\n\nDesserts!!! They're dessert buffet is a delightful array of various desserts packed into a mini version of original. Talk about tiramisu, chocolatte mousse cake, blueberry cake, tapoica pudding (with mango and peach hmmm!), fruit mouse, key line pies, and much more. \n\nPlus, I ordered champagne for sunday morning brunch. Love it! The server kept coming back to me every time my glass was empty. Felt like a superstar... well not really.\n\nBut the Wynn was worth the $40.

For a lunch price and to get all that food it was a good deal.\n\nThe quality of food was good, both times. I think it's better than the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmo. There was a large variety of food all of which were good. Usually, at Vegas buffets, the sushi is crap, but at the Buffet, the sushi was pretty decent. \n\nThe stalls in the restrooms are similar to private rooms, so you can do your business in semi-privacy.

If you cant get line passes, I wouldn't ever bother unless you like standing in long lines with antsy tourists, usually packing kids, for long periods of time.

S'My husband\'s family has a saying at mealtime: "If you go hungry it is your own fault" and never has this saying been truer than at the Wynn Buffet. Seriously, if you can\'t find something to eat here then you are too picky to go out for a meal. We had breakfast here the day of my brother\'s wedding and it was quite a treat. The potato cakes with pepperjack were little squares of heaven and I could have made a meal out of them if I wasn\'t too busy stuffing my face with pain au chocolate. Lest you think I only carbed it up, I did try the delicious sausage with peppers and the perfectly cooked scrambled eggs. I think I actually squealed when I saw the olive tapenade and crostini and made sure that found its way onto my plate. Sadly, this tapenade left a lot to be desired, the salty tang that I love was missing and it was incredibly bland. But, that was the only misstep in an otherwise amazing meal. \n\nOnly advice? Get there early if you are going to breakfast because at 9:30 the line is pretty long although it moves rather fast.'

S"3.5 Stars. \nQuick verdict: If you love love dessert, the Wynn Buffet is for you! \nIf not, you're better off at the buffets inside the Bellagio, Rio or Planet Hollywood.\n\nFor some reason, I've never really been impressed with the Wynn Buffet.  Sure it's nice, but every time I go (and I don't know why I go), I always come away unsatisfied. Yes, I would expect the Wynn Buffet to be top notch in presentation, quality, and class. Yes, I would expect their food to be good. It's just there's not a whole lot variety to pick from.\n \nSure, you get the usual cuts of meats and crab legs and some Asian favorites, but beyond that I kept wondering where that $42 is going into? By the 2nd trip, I ran out of things to eat and resorted to a slice of pizza - something I was trying to avoid eating.  I was expecting a whole lot more. Also of note, the prime rib came out very rare.  The lamb chops though - DE-licious!\n\nI hafta admit the taste is definitely superb and the quality is tops - all fine and dandy up to the point you realize that the Bellagio can offer just about the same level goodness but provide A LOT more food options to really wring your money's worth.\n\nWhere you're really putting the money into here is what comes after the meal.  If you're totally in it for the desserts, then the Wynn Buffet is for you.  This place has probably the most impressive (and largest?) dessert bar of any buffet I've been to around town. Gelatos, tiramisu, creme brulee, cookies, cakes, bread pudding...you name it, they've got it. All very decadent to commit sinful rapture on your sweet tooth.  \n\nAnd I love my dessert. But I also love my main course dishes too and would expect Mr. Wynn to provide a myriad of electic food items to satiate all my taste buds. For the money, I'd place my bets on the Bellagio or Rio."

S'I do adore the weekend champagne brunch, but not for the food - for the champagne, of course!  \n\nThe food...well, the food is "eh" at best, and inedible at worst.  The buffet is extensive and covers nearly any palette, but because it\'s done in such a mass quantity and left to sit out, is not particularly fresh or hot.  The desserts mostly had a rubbery consistency, save for the tasty peach cobbler and pecan rolls.  The ice cream bar is also a very safe bet.\n\nSteer clear of the shrimp...they were room-temperature and slimy on the skin, so we had to pass after a bite, for fear we\'d get sick.  Most everything was heat-lamped too long and was too dry to enjoy, but if my tip would be to sit at a table with view of the buffet chef - you can watch them put out new dishes and run over to get them fresh.  They won\'t taste delicious, but at least they\'ll be consumed straight-from-the-oven.\n\nI have heard that the dinner buffet is better, but for the price of champagne brunch, I expected that the food quality would suffer, so I wasn\'t disappointed when this came to fruition.\n\nHowever, for the $30 or whatever it was, the ability to sit in a garden-of-eden-meets-Mad-Hatter-tea-party room with the sun streaming in, nibbling some food and drinking champagne was well worth the price tag.  It\'s a great way to spend a Sunday morning at the Wynn.\n\nSo grab a glass, settle in, and, if you really want good food, stick to the fresh-made stations like the omelets, or just go somewhere else.'

Since salad would be a waste of my time and pasta takes up a lot of space, I went for the sushi and seafood area first.  This is the area that would usually make it or break it for me at buffets.  The freshness of the salmon and poke tuna made it!  The spicy tuna mini handrolls made it for me too!  But the selection at the seafood station seemed to be limited.  I expected more dishes.       \n\nMy omelet was made quick to perfection.  The thin crust pizzas impressed me!  At the carving station, it was all about the pepper crusted bacon!  Prime rib was average.  The desserts were not only plentiful, but also were nice to look at.  \n\nI think I got too full too quick because of the drinks.

Finally when we were seated it took a while for the hostess to get our drinks... As for the food, skip the asian section... As for the steak, it was chewy and not seasoned well enough. The smoked salmon was pretty good and the shrimp was solid.

S"ALL YOU CAN EAT PRE-SHELLED ALASKAN KING CRAB LEGS, SAY WHATTTTT?!?!\n\nOh yeah, and there's other food too....\n\nFor $38!!  What a deal!\n\nWe got there about 9pm which I thought would be late and uncrowded for dinner, but there was still a line!  (The city that never sleeps, am I right?)  We waited about 15 minutes and were seated at a cute little table for two.\n\nMe and my BF had planned way before we ever set foot in Vegas that we would eat here, but eat ONLY CRAB for maximum enjoyment and value.  As such, we quickly scanned the buffet lines for anything that looked worthwhile...I picked up a few pieces of sushi for carbs...he got some prime rib...and bee-lined straight to the crab station!  We piled high a full plate of crab legs each, poured ourselves some hot melted butter, and took an additional plate for all the shells.\n\nNow the FANTASTIC thing about THESE crab legs from THIS buffet is not only that they're Alaskan King Crab....but they're also pre-sliced, in half, down the middle.  That means no shelling, cracking, digging, biting, griping, complaining, etc.\n\nAnd we feasted!  And when we were finished, we went back to the buffet for another heaping plate of crab legs each, and of course, more hot butter.  When we got back to our table we noticed that our dirty plates had been cleared away!  Yay for service!  And we feasted some more!\n\nI don't have to explain how delicious the crab was because everyone already knows.  I will say, however, that the sushi was nothing special, and anything else that my BF tried at the buffet he described as mediocre.  CRAB is the only way to go here, baby!\n\nIn the end, my BF went to get some desserts, while I basked in all my crab-eating glory and relished the final taste of crab and butter in my mouth.  No dessert required for me!  We tipped generously and left on our merry way, happy, beyond satiated, and ready to swear off crab for a full month."

S'Its freaking amazing. Unlimited king crab legs!!! Prime rib, lamb, everything you can think of, a ceviche bar, sushi, pizza, you name it its there, crepes they make for you on the fly, a huge dessert section, and all of it is very good, not your typical buffet. My only issue was the pricing. The Wynn really likes to ream you anyway they can even in this economy. I will post a Wynn Hotel review later. I would go here, but it is 40$ a person so prepare to spend a little for a buffet.'

S"By far my favorite buffet in Vegas. Yes, the 2 hour wait was painful. Watching people get the delicious food while your tummy is empty could be a killer. This buffet can appeal to everyone with different preferences in food. Once we were seated, I went straight for the seafood station. King crab legs and shrimp were fresh and nicely prepared. Compared to the other three buffets we tried during the trip, Wynn is elegant, but worth every penny you pay. Dessert was a splurge when I already had food up to my throat. If it's your first trip to Vegas, make sure you give this place a try."

S'My best friend and I headed to Vegas for a relaxing weekend away and stayed at the Wynn hotel for our long weekend.\n\nOn Saturday we chose to hit up the champagne brunch at the hotel. WOW! It was great! Awesome selection and variety! They had everything from fresh fruit, hot and cold cereal, eggs benedict, fresh "create your own" omelets, prime rib, hand carved roasted bacon, enchiladas, seafood and ceviches, dim sum and a tantalizing dessert bar! \n\nFrom the outside it doesn\'t look all the big inside but it\'s really huge and have these fun topiary like chandeliers hanging in the center of the restaurant. I especially liked that we got to bypass the HUGE line of people because we were hotel guests! \n\nHere\'s what I tried:\nMini belgian waffles- YUM! YUM! They\'re about 2" x 2" and you have a choice of warm maple syrup, strawberry or blueberry compote. I had a couple with the blueberry compote....soooo scrumptious! \nFresh fruit- very sweet!\nEggs benedict w/ tazzo ham- yummy but it didn\'t stay warm and luke warm eggs and hollandaise is not so appetizing.\nSalmon w/ capers- Delish! \nBBQ Pork bao- not the best I\'ve had but not too bad either. \nBreakfast pizza- a bit unusual but good nonetheless. They all were on a crispy thin crust, with eggs and cheese and either veggies, sausage or plain. Gives an all new meaning to having pizza for breakfast! \n\nDessert! They have a whole separate room devoted to desserty goodness! From danishes and breads, mini cupcakes, cookies, eclairs and scooped gelato and sundaes. So much desserty goodness! \n\nOne of the better buffets I\'ve had. When in Vegas a must try!!!!'

S"I've been to the Champagne Weekend buffet in the past, and it was delicious!   The place is as beautifully decorated as before, with lovely light and bright buttercup walls.  It always feels super clean and posh. The tables and chairs/boothes are very comfortable and the servers were attentive.\n\nThis time, we went to a weekday breakfast buffet ($20.99 pp) and despite lack of seafood (no crab nor shrimp on the Friday buffet) I enjoyed it immensely.  I knew that it it was a smaller buffet going in, so I felt fine about the other options. I did a walk by all the food to best prioritize, and am happy to report that 98% of all I tasted was great!  \n\nHighlights that I'd recommend: \n+Smoked salmon \n+Corned Beef Hash \n+Small Fruit parfaits (one watermelon and whisky) other Caprese - delightful\n+Blood Orange Sorbet!  It was so refreshing and full of intense citrus flavor.\n+Dessert selection was amazing... pity I had no more room to indulge.\n\nInteresting tastes that I'm happy I tried, but perhaps wouldn't go for again:\n-Blue corn pancake with berry butter topping- healthy, but it got cold fast, even though it is made to order at the pancake station.  I'd probably go for good ole buttermilk next time - with the berry butter. \n\n-Candied Apple. It looks amazing - a glossy candy red apple.  But it was difficult to eat and I had to really put some effort into cutting it with my knife.  Chew with care as the candy shell is rock hard.  Hubby would have preferred a Caramel Apple.\n\nBottom line:  a beautiful buffet.  I'd be back anytime."

S"Out of this world.  Very fresh ingredients and high quality food.  Well worth the money. \n\nI spent 3 hours there with 2 friends.  We enjoyed every minute and every plate with rests in between.  The fruit was wonderful.  They had a cheese and cold cut area we didn't have room for.  I did not try the pizza because there were so many other amazing things.  \n\nI overheard one girl complaining she was going to ask for her money back.  Her friend explained she was a vegetarian.  She must have been a really picky eater.  I saw a ton of things she could have enjoyed. \n\nThey change the menu from brunch to dinner at 3:30pm.  I highly recommend coming in the late afternoon so you can enjoy both varieties.  At dinner, they put out these mini salads to die for including one with roasted pears, grapes and candied pecans.  Amazing. \n\nI paid $50 for the meal including $7 for all I could drink and $8 tip.  Well worth it!"

S"I have to start off by saying that the Wynn is gorgeous! The entrance to the hotel and the indoor garden is beautiful! I truly wished the food was as beautiful as the decor. The buffet had high expectations through the past reviews that we read before choosing to go the the Wynn Buffet- we should had gone to Wicked Spoon.\n\nThe service was okay- we has stacks of plates sitting at the table for at least 15 minutes before one of the waitstaff came to pick up the food.\n\nThe red snapper was left out for too long, had a fishy smell, and was hard on one end for being under the heat for so long. \n\nThe egg whites were watery and had the texture of cottage cheese.\nThe smoked salmon was out for far to long  as well and also had a really bad fishy smell. \n\nThe only saving grace for this buffet was the dessert station- filled with delicious mini pastries and delicious pretzel bars!!! \n\nMy suggestion is to avoid Wynn Buffett  and head to Cosmo's Wicked spoon due to the quality, service, and overall presentation- not to mention it's cheaper than the Wynn buffet"

S'Skip the brunch!\n\nI heard great things about the Wynn buffet, so we headed straight there on the drive in from LA. We got there about noon on a Saturday, so it was brunch. The line at least was short- we only waited about 15 minutes. But the buffet itself- what a disappointment! Aside from the prime rib (which was good, but not amazing), fried chicken, and a salmon dish, there was very little meat for the size of the buffet, and also very few vegetable dishes. We try to eat low-carb, so I actually ate less than I normally would have at a buffet. The omelette station was good, but I could get a good omelette anywhere for $10. Oh, and the eggs benedict had hard yolks - yuck! (the $13 buffet at the Palms even got the yolks runny!) The dessert spread was impressive, but nothing was amazing. I was pretty excited about the mini cupcakes, except the vanilla cupcake had mint frosting, which was odd. Overall, everything was good, but nothing was super-memorable. Definitely not worth the price, at least for brunch.'

S"All of the restaurants on the Wynn property are ridiculously overpriced.  The Buffet is no exception.  As reviewed many times here, the meats were mostly dry and flavorless, especially the sausage.  The Kobe meatloaf was horrible.  The brisket was fine, though.\n\nThe sushi rice was very cold and hard, as is stated many time here.  You'd think they'd fix that.  The seafood crepes were cold, even though they had just been put out.  The lamb meatballs were OK, but wild boar risotto was dry and not well seasoned.\n\nThe variety is great, the dishes are somewhat exotic, but they taste and preparation of the food was very very disappointing.  However, if you want to sample a variety of mediocre food and don't want to pay the crazy prices at the other Wynn restaurants, your $40+ here will get you more quantity."

S"I've heard a lot of hype about the buffet at Wynn and I had to experience it myself to see what it's all about. Without a doubt in my mind it didn't meet my expectations considering there are lots of choices when it comes to food. For $87 for two people I'd expect better selection. \n           \n            The only foods that I can remember I liked was the King crab and the pot stickers, everything else was just mediocre. The dessert selection was just terrible, kinda like the Golden Corral quality. Common, what's all this hype? I've tried just about every buffet restaurant in Vegas at the major casinos and only one stands out above all and that's the Bellagio hands down. They even give you silverware. The worst part of the Wynn buffet is the dessert selection, compare it to Bellagio, $27.95  and it'll speak for itself.  Why waste your money and not get what you pay for?  All in all It depends on what you like. \n\n           Everyone runs for the crab and prime rib and that's all there is to talk about there on the main meal. I was told there was gelato! what gelato? I know what gelato looks and taste like and they did not have any. Some people are making false statements about the food at the Wynn. They must have been too hungry to know the difference in food qualtiy. Sushi? ha, it was a total joke!  Your local grocery store has better. Common, are people supposed to be taken this stupid? They should leave out foods they do not know how to make. It leaves a bad taste to remember. Someone mentioned the food quality at the Wynn is better than the Bellagio! are you serious! you can't be serious. No way is it even close. I'm sure most will agree. \n\n              From the start, Bellagio compared to the Wynn. Better meat selection, better sushi (although I see it sub par), best in dessert hands down, better service, and of course better pricing. What else is more needed? Still think the food quality at the Wynn is better? NO WAY! That's like saying the Pontiac Fiero is better looking than a Ferrari, well, that just depends on the individual right?"

I'm a huge sweets person and it's not exactly hard to make some delicious desserts, right?  I don't think I enjoyed a single dessert at the Wynn."

S"Richard Pro here with another review.\n\nMy first time to the Wynn buffet, and it was extraordinary. We waited about thirty minutes and were seated in the atrium in the buffet, It's probably the nicest area in the entire place and I'm quite surprised we got such a prime seat. \n\nSunday brunch was pretty expensive but ultimately, you get what you pay for. The desserts, quite simply, make you drool because there are so many varieties and they're quite pretty. Someone will hand scoop gelato for you if you so desire. Everything is beautiful and arranged perfectly. \n\nYou'll find a delicious array of delicacies like smoked salmon pizza, an antipasto platter, muesli, a cranberry/cheese ravioli, and thickly sliced cuts of meat like turkey, roast beef, bacon, and ham. The bacon was my absolute favorite. It's not supermarket bacon, but a delicious hunk of goodness.\n\nInterior--extremely bright and inviting. You can probably sit for three hours, which is what I did.\n\n5 stars. Best buffet in Vegas."

S'This place always came up when talking to people about where to go for lunch, so my expectations were high when we headed to the Wynn. \nWe got in a couple of minutes before lunch prices kicked in, so we got the cheaper breakfast rate, which was a plus.\n\nThe place is probably good compared to other buffets, but really why even go to one in the first place. None of the dished were very good. The pizza was bland, the ceviche fairly uninteresting, the kobe beef sliders disappointing. Sure, the roast beef was ok and there was a lot of food, but honestly if I had made any of those dishes at home, I would have been disappointed about the outcome, and I would definitely never serve it to someone else.\n\nSave your money and go to a real restaurant.'

S"Wow!  Talk about food overload.  This is not your typical buffet that you would think of in Vegas.  We ate here once for both breakfast and dinner.  This place has lots of high quality food on the buffet, much of which is home made.  For breakfast they had a fantastic pancake station, along with omelette's.  For dinner, they have a pasta station where they will make pasta with any kind of sauce you want.  They had some very different dishes like jalapeno and cheese chicken sausage.  When you go here you pretty much just want to grab a bunch of different things and try it.  Don't try to eat it all, because it's not possible.  For dessert, they have home made ice cream, cake, cookies, brownies, and at dinner they even had a crepe station.  This is unlike any buffet you will go to.  I highly recommend it if you are staying at the Wynn or Encore.  While it may seem a little pricey for a buffet, you'll understand why once you get inside.  Like anything else, you get what you pay for.  If you want the cheap $8.99 buffet with low quality frozen food, go downtown."

S"Now, don't let the simple name mislead you - this is a quality buffet.  It definitely runs more towards the high end like the rest of the Wynn, but you certainly get some quality for your money.  Both times I've been here, my friends and I came for brunch, so I'm not really sure what the dinner menu is like.  However, if their brunch is any indication, I imagine it's pretty good.\n\nBeyond the usual breakfast dishes (scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, etc.), they included less common items like grits and eggs benedict, and there was even an omelet station as well.  As expected, the food was pretty diverse (American, Asian, Mexican, Pizza, fruits/salad, seafood) and there was the usual butcher station, but I was really impressed that they had congee.  I mean, it wasn't great congee, but it was still decent enough for a buffet.  My favorites were the eggs benedict and the prime rib though.  A little heavy to eat that much meat to start the day off, but it was delicious.\n\nMy friends seemed to think the desserts were pretty good, and I've seen a number of reviews mention that the creme brulee is something to try, but I can't say for sure myself (I was too full for dessert).  Overall, the food is great, but it's not cheap (about $37 a head?).  In comparison, I think Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan had more good dishes to offer (and was a bit cheaper), but I think Wynn is a little more consistent (not many misses).\n\nYou know, even though Vegas was a while ago, there are still times where I feel like I'm still full from all the eating on our trip."

Wait, I take that back, they are dANGEROUS.\n\nAnd worst of all, they are extremely bad for people like me who run in there pushing down anyone in my way to get a look at the vastly large circle of food all smelling delicious and looking might good as it glistens in the light.  and go early to avoid the line.  we went at 4pm and stayed till 8pm.  Even reloaded.\n\nAs i walked passed the desserts to my table, I found myself at the center in front of the roast station with the seafood to my left and italian to my right.  It was like being a kid in a full on candy store, and knowing that I could eat as much as I want, was dangerous.\n\nSo what did I have?\n- Seafood - large cocktail shrimps were a little bit tough as if they were frozen for some time, but i do like me some shrimp (the ocean called, they're running out of shrimp).  The alaskan crab was excellent and we each got a cup of butter to go with each of it.  (you'd think, a cup of butter?  is that necessary?  but its all to make it easier to dip)\n\n- Chinese - The Siu Mai was good and the egg rolls were hard to look away from.  Normally I'd tell myself to only eat the stuff that are worth and not found anywhere else.  This rule doesn't always work.\n\n- Roast - My FAVORITE DISH was the lamb.  I kept going back for 3rds and it makes me very happy that several pieces of this was in my stomach which made me full.  Somehow, they managed to make it very tender and it tasted like butter as you bite off the meat.  The prime rib was alright, I didn't even finish my entire piece.  skip the turkey\n\n- Grill - the veal short ribs were another favorite of mine here.  even scored me some asparagus on the side which was nice.  The kalbi shank had a nice flavor, but still somewhat dry.\n\n- Dessert - I think the creme brulee was well worth getting above everything. Or maybe get some fruits since if you're like me, you fear that you eat so much that my diet is going to not like me.  \n\nFor a buffet, it's definitely good, but some small things got me dissapointed.  Still worth $40 tho!"

I wasnt bad, but it definitely is not worth it anymore.\n\nThe price for dinner was $39.95 (which is like $4 more then last time I visited) and they no longer had king crab. For essentially a $50 dinner, I expect king crab, but they had snow crab which tasted old and not very good. The shrimp cocktail looked disgusting.\n\nThe other stuff wasnt bad.

S'My husband and I love this place! Inside, you do not get a feeling of being at a "buffet" dining establishment. Lots of whimsical decor to match the Wynn theme is brought inside. Food is good here...we are seafood eaters mainly and the ample crab legs keep us happy. The dessert area is so fun....really upscale desserts and so tasty. Their gelato variety is few, but extremely one of the best gelatos.....definitely, better than Jean Phillipes.'

S'After you come to this buffet, any other buffet just plain sucks.\n\nThere is Elk meat here! That stuff tastes sooo unique, it kinda tastes like duck, but more flavorful and more distinct.  Its hard to explain go and try!\n\nThere are lots of alaska king crab legs here, and a butter dispenser.  \n\nCreme brulee, I ATE 100 of these before i left with a candied apple.  \n\nThis place is food heaven.  I wish it were my kitchen at home.\n\nI started lining up at 3pm?  And paid for lunch but it turned into dinner, sooooooo plan your time wisely!  Eat all day!'

S"Yes, I'm in love with this buffet. There's nothing better than feeling absolutely full when you're surrounded by such a rich atmosphere (haha!). \n\nWhy'd it get knocked down to four stars? 2 reasons: #1 This isn't your everyday buffet - make sure you save up because it is mighty pricey! But use the frequent buffet-goers tip: come in toward the end of lunch time (=lunch prices) and stay until dinner is served (=more awesome dinner food). #2 The line was long! I was already starving when I got into line and more than a half an hour later, even hungrier!\n\nTry a little bit of everything because I did and it was ALL awesome! Then go back for seconds of what you really liked. Then when you're already full, hit the deserts which put you over the top. Oh, the deserts - their presentation is absolutely amazing and makes you want to grab one of each cake, pie, mousse, cookie, sorbet, gelatin, and any other nifty little desert they had out. I wouldn't suggest grabbing one of each though, unless you want diabetes from one meal. \n\nIt's been a few months since I went, so I can't quite remember everything, but a few things that stand out in my memory are:\n- a curry station. i think that's what it was. we got to choose the vegetables, the meat, etc and they cook it for you. it turned out really really good!\n- salads in a cup. they had small portioned prepared salads of different variety - all looked really good! the one i got was good good good!\n- and their desert bar/room/area thing. oh yea, i already mentioned that one.\n\nThe ambiance is very clean and upscale. What did I say, you get what you pay for. The only thing that bothered me was the couple next to us. Only the man would get up and get food while the girl just sat there like a princess. Hmmm, guess it was her loss cause she didn't explore the buffet herself!!"

S"I think this place is good, though not as amazing as it's hyped up to be. I found the Italian fare to be my favorite. Some of the meats are good and some are mediocre, but I felt that the portions were all too big! The king crab legs are good. Unfortunately, most of the fish I had was too dry. \n\nThe dessert bar had a bunch of yummy selections. My party and I highly enjoyed the chocolate crunch cake! The creme brulee, orange tapioca, and chocolate dessert in a cup were also quite good. The chocolate gelato was our favorite! The chocolate flavor was intense, like getting punched in the face by a giant chocolate bar! \n\nI give the food 3.5 stars. Four stars overall because of the lovely ambiance and quick service. Luckily, we came at 5pm and only waited 30 minutes!"

S'Compared to a lot of buffets, this one is pretty much on top of the list. I havent tried Bellagios yet, so that one is next. \nGourmet food, and totally worth paying a little bit more for. We went for dinner on a Thursday night (cheaper then fri or sat), it was $33 per person. This is a great price considering a meal at any Vegas Restaurant is usually $50 per person, at least. \nSuch amazing food, good selection, KING CRAB already peeled with TONS of things to choose from. Everyone should try this buffet at least once.'

S"To review Las Vegas buffets I've broken it down into 4 sections.\n\nAppetizers:\nA decent selection, but what Wynn focused on is quality.  Exceptionally well laid out Shrimp and especially the crab legs.  I was surprised by the level of quality of the available seafood.  They may not focus on a large variety but appears to have the best quality. \n\nSalads:\nVery good selection of veggies and really tasty dressing here as well.\n\nMain Entree:\nNot much variety but they definitely focused on quality.  They attempt to provide the best quality dishes in a buffet setting. \n\nDesserts:\nI personally did not care for their offerings but did have things like refreshing gelato being served.\n\nAgain, this place does not provide the variety of other Las Vegas buffets, but  they do offer a high consistent quality buffet.\n\n\nDecor: 5 Stars (very tastefully decorated)\nService: 4 Stars (friendly staff)\nAtmosphere: 5 Stars (friendly)\nFood Quality: 5 Stars (great quality)\nQuantity of Food: 5 Stars (its all you can eat)\nPrice: 4 Stars (worth the high price)\n\nFor a Grand Total of 5 Stars."

S"I had heard from a lot of people that the Wynn Buffet was a must-try. So during this last trip to Vegas, I made sure that we would FINALLY try it. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. \n\nWe were in Vegas for EDC weekend and our last meal was a couple tacos from Del Taco 24 hours prior to our trip to the buffet, therefore.... I was beyond excited for this buffet - I was starving for it! We arrived shortly after 3:30pm, so we ended up having to pay $40+/per person for the dinner buffet. I was more than happy to pay this, expecting an epic meal to satisfy my hungry tummy. There was a small line when we got there, but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. \n\nOne thing's for sure, this buffet is beautifully decorated. The ambiance is great. Eating here, I definitely felt fancy. Just wish I felt the same about the food. For the price we paid, the selection wasn't that great. The food was good, but I wouldn't say it was worth the $80 we paid. The server was pleasant, but we had to ask and wait for her to bring us napkins and water refills. \n\nThe dessert selection was amazing, though! Lots of items to choose from! My boyfriend had tapped out and was passing on dessert so I had to tackle the dessert section on my own. If I could afford to, I would definitely have gotten one of everything. But, instead I chose a few to share -- passionfruit tapioca pudding, rocky road cake, blueberry cheesecake, and my fave, creme brulee! All so delicious! If I had more room, I would have definitely loved to try the gelato and made-to-order crepes. \n\nOverall, it was an okay buffet. I could go back to this place, but it wouldn't be my first choice."

S"Five stars? But it's a buffet!\n\nWell, I give it five stars because it far exceeded any expectation I had of what a buffet is.\n\nAt roughly $45 per person, this is hardly a bargain. However, if you have a couple of hours to kill and you are disciplined enough to pace yourself, you are in a for a treat after treat after treat.\nThe best time to come on a weekend is at 10:00am. Any later than that and you'll be waiting in line for over an hour; almost two hours at around 12:00pm. Nothing is worth standing in line for that long.\n\nThe dining room is bright. The chairs are comfortable. There's elbow room and plenty of room to walk between your table and the food stations.\n\nI prefer bite size servings at buffets, so Asian dumplings, Vietnamese spring rolls, Chinese stuffed mushrooms and things of that sort are a favorite way to start the meal...I then work my way up the line.\n\nAvoid foods like potatoes, any type of pasta, bread, sushi, or the classic carving board offerings...or salad, for that matter. You can have those any time. Stick to the less common stuff and you'll still not be able to try it all. \n\nBy the way, the little transparent cup with the red and yellow filling topped with a raspberry on the bottom right of the desserts image is a tropical fruit pudding/jelly/custardy thing that made my toes curl with joy...just sayin'.\n\nI am feeling a bit guilty for giving a buffet five stars...but I have to stick to this one. It really is as good as it gets for a hotel buffet."

S"I was entertaining my friend from Japan and we came here specifically to sit in the garden and enjoy our buffet in the Alice in Wonderland like surroundings. It's a fantastic place for photos. If it wasn't so cute I would have probably chosen the buffet at the Cosmo because the food there looked like more foodie deliciousness but the ambiance added a lot to our experience here.\n\nWe had timed it perfectly arrived around 10:30 and were there for the tail end of breakfast and the beginning of lunch for the breakfast prices. Unexpectedly awesome! So that meant we ate twice as much because there were twice as many things to try.  Ugggh we were such fattty's we didn't leave till 2 lol then we had to stroll down to the pool and nap it off. \n\nHighlights for me were the smoked salmon, the fruit soups for breakfast, the pea risotto, and the steak they had at lunch. My friend had eaten at the red rocks buffet earlier in the week and she said they didn't have steak on their buffet and she was there for dinner. Gasp! She enjoyed the red meat and the numerous pre-made salads in the cute little serving cups. \n\nWe both liked the cream puffs and I couldn't get enough of the creme anglais. I could just drink that straight out of the container it's so delicious and many people don't use it because they don't know what it is. What a shame. \n\nSatisfying buffet. You do have to wait a bit if you want to sit in the garden area but I'd say it's worth the wait. Our server cleaned away our plates but he made sure I saw him clean it every single time. He would come over and chit chat with us before taking away our old plates which I think was nice."

S"The line for the Wynn buffet was super long at around 10:40 am when we got there. The hotel was heated, although a little too much for me. I was impressed with the hotel, and the design of the buffet. The buffet was more than I'm used to paying for a lunch buffet, but then again, it's the Wynn. I was impressed with the entrees and appetizers, but I was disappointed by the desserts. The selection of food was awesome- I think I had a bite of almost everything- I particularly enjoyed the fish selection, and the sushi hand rolls were surprisingly good too. I liked the mini prepared salads in the little cups- I tasted flavor combinations I've never tried before. After stuffing yourself at this buffet, you can walk across the street to the Las Vegas Fashion Outlet and walk it off."

S"Hands down my most favorite buffet in Vegas and anywhere else for that matter! It's exceptional. We have eaten here for lunch and for dinner. Dinner, obviously, had more food then lunch and I would say is the better option. I think it was like $34 or so a person and is well worth that. You get your money's worth. The place itself is beautiful and kept immaculatly clean. The buffet area never got too crowded where you felt annoyed, the waitresses do a great job of clearing out your old plates and bringing drinks, and the food is excellent! I don't think I disliked a single thing I ate here. You can choose from Chinese, American, Italian, salad bar, seafood, and more....the deserts were awesome, too. They have a sundae section where you can pick out different toppings to go on whatever ice cream you want and then not to mention all the cheesecake, carrot cake and cookies you can imagine! It's really over the top and a must-do I think if you are visiting Vegas. The hotel itself is a site to see, it's really spectacular. I highly recommend it."

S"I had dinner here tonight. It was $43+ in total with tax, before tip. I felt that if I were staying at Wynn, I would eat there for convenience but I would not make it a destination. I really want to rate it more like 3.75 stars. \n\nDecor: The decor was comfortable and nice. They have many different areas, some nicer than others. You may be seated in a larger area than one of the smaller more luxurious areas. \n\nThe Service: Very respectible. From the minute the valet took my car to the return of the car, the staff were all very helpful and accomodative. \n\nThe Food: \n\n- It was good but lacked the more gourmet items of Bacchanal (Caesar's), Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan), and even Bellagio Buffet. \n\n- They also had less of a variety than Bellagio (The Buffet), Cosmopolitan (Wicked Spoon), Bacchanal (Caesar's). The delicacy of items was also kind of lacking. \n\nSome examples:\n\n- For meats, they had no lamb. Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon had a great lamb which is custom seared to your liking. \n\n- For shrimp, they had good but not so great shrimp. Caesar's (Bacchanal) had large tiger shrimp. \n\n- For oysters, well, they had no oysters of any kind. \n\nCospmoploitan's (Wicked Spoon) had cooked oysters but no raw ones. \nCaesar's (Bacchanal) had raw oysters.\nAria had raw oysters. \nBellagio (The Buffet) had no oysters at all.  \n\n- No smoked salmon or any kind of salmon. Bellagio had smoked salmon at dinner. Others may have had too.\n\n- The sushi area was limited. There was no sashimi, mostly sushi rolls and one eel sushi. I tried none of it. \n\n- For desert, they had a good selection, but nothing like the giant strawberries at Bacchanal (Caesar's). I will say that the desert section was better than the rest of the buffet. \n\nIt's very good overall but I can't see going back to it. It's good but lacks the higher-end / wow elements of some of the others, but avoids the mostly fried Planet Hollywood fare."

S"I'm not a huge fan of buffets so I'm a little biased. \n\nThe buffet is average.  Service sucked, but that's to be expected.  You can't really judge a buffet by the service.  Price is high.  They also split us up because if you have a party of 7 or more they automatically add 18% for tip. We said it didn't matter and we could sit together, but they said they had no room for us and that it was really busy so they split us up anyways.  Oh well... It didn't really matter, but it wasn't that busy :)  I have been for dinner but this review is for both but mainly for lunch.  \n\nFood was average (at least it was edible) \nMost of the meat was overcooked and dry (maybe I came at the wrong time)\nAhi tuna seemed frozen, definitely not fresh or it was soaked in a weird cucumber sauce.\nSeafood selection was minimal at lunch.\nMy mom had the sushi and thought it was dry... I didn't even go near it.\nThe chocolate ice cream had small pieces of ice in it, but it wasn't bad.  Just made it less creamy and a little crunchy.\nThe lemon and apple desserts were good.  Most of the others were not (too generic... very sweet, but no depth)\nI liked the Caulifower, but the brussel spouts were tough.  \nCheese selection was minimal but decent. \n \nNote: I hate wasting food so I try to finish most of my plate. In a buffet, I'll take a small portion of what looks good and try it and go back if I like it.  I can't start with a huge plate and barely eat it... I've learned traveling its wrong to waste food.\n\nThe only time this buffet is worth it is if you have picky eaters or starving crazy large appetite friends or family members.  The price for lunch is too much for what they service.  Dinner is more, but the food seems a little better... However, for the amount you pay, I'd rather be served a meal that they spend time cooking and amending if needed according to my taste.\n\nHonestly, everything looked better than it tasted."

I didn't like the fact that they required you to tip beforehand and wrote on your bill how much you were tipping the server.  This seemed ridiculous to me as a tip is dependent on the quality of service you receive.\n\nThe second time we went to the buffet, it was not as good as some of the food was cold and some of the food didn't appear as fresh.\n\nI would like to see more fruit choices and some lower calorie dessert options like some of the other buffets have."

It was an enjoyable experience, we were looking for good sushi but I'm not sure if that can be found in a buffet. \n\nThe gelato was the best desert but the second time I went back to get it the almonds and coconut slivers tasted pretty stale.

They do have some nice gimmicks though. Like the crepe station and the ice cream thing. Aladdin pre-Planet Hollywood had a better buffet than Wynn, no offense. When I got to the dessert area I was like WTF this is it. I don\'t even remeber if they had carrot cake which is one of my requirements for a good buffet. I think I ate it but I don\'t remeber cos I guess I couldn\'t get over the fact of the $39.99. Only place I can really compare it too is Bellagio which I think is much better on many different levels. Ok if they charge like $29.99 I would have given it an extra star. Haha and I thought the holiday $26.99 meal at the Mandalay was pricey. That doesn\'t even compare. Oh and you can\'t really compare the whole king crab leg thing anymore. Most hotels have the king crab legs. I wonder if going to Vegas on some presidents day is a holiday.'

S'What could top the Bellagio? Wynn right?\n\nEek! Methinks not. \n\nWas there for Brunch/Dinner.\n\n37 per person on a weekday for brunch? Strike one.\n(before anyone asks, it was a few days before christmas so the prices were inflated - Holiday weekday brunch)\n\nSo, what was the seasonal awesomeness that bumped up the price?\nPumpkin ravioli? Super sweet and cinnamon-y pumpkin pie filling wrapped in pasta. Yeah... what else was seasonal... beats me.\n\nThe buffet is quite a bit smaller than bellagio, and the selection was comparitively small. they had hand rolls with spicy tuna which = cone of nori with tons of rice and a small ball of spicy tuna. Took one bite and dropped the rice bomb back onto my plate. The rest of the sushi rolls were kinda meh..\n\nThe majority of stuff was pretty boring. Nothing really stood out, and most of the food trays were mislabeled. After the changeover to dinner (we weren\'t there long, we got in about 30 minutes before the changeover) many of the signs were still wrong, the food was still unimpressive, and I was still disappointed by all of the "Wynn is the end all be all buffet"  comments. \n\n1) the buffet is BEAUTIFUL if you\'re seated in the small sky-lighted garden seating area. Otherwise you\'ll be seated on ostrich skin in a boring pastel shaped room. I preferred the seating at the Bellagio since we didn\'t get the nicely lit outdoorsy section. \n\n2) The food was on par with Bellagio. What stood out?\na. King crab legs (Bellagio had snow crab legs) again, waterlogged cold flavorless mush. Why people lined up and walked away with 20 legs per plate still confuse me. I had 3, and I only finished them so they didn\'t go to waste. \n\n3) Sweet Gulf Shrimp time.. How I missed you. These were larger than the ones at Bellagio, which were larger than the P-Ho ones. They were all about as tasty and snappy in texture, just slight size differences. \n\nConsidering this was the most expensive of the 3 buffets, I also ate the least here. I just wasn\'t that impressed, and there wasn\'t much that I really wanted to eat. It saddens me. \n\nService was not on par with Bellagio. Where Bellagio made all the dishes disappear, at the Wynn, the plates sat on our tiny little table. Our drinks were served in smallish cups, and were not refilled for quite some time. Empty drink glasses weren\'t taken away with the places until I put them on top of the plates. Wierd, considering the motto that everything is better at the Wynn. \n\n2 stars. I wouldn\'t have been impressed if I was charged 20 dollars instead of 37. I still would have chosen Bellagio. The fact that I did pay as much as I did would make this a 1 star considering the other options. No Food Poisoning and Food on par with Bellagio (but a much smaller selection) gives this place an extra star.\n\nI\'ll try it again in the future I guess, maybe, but I don\'t have high hopes for this buffet. Bellagio FTW.\n\n\nAs I read through the comments, Laurissa Y. sorta summed up my feelings of this buffet. She also reminded me to mention that it was the "Holiday weekday brunch" that I paid for. I\'m glad I didnt have to deal with a line when I went. No line... actually I should have taken that as a warning...'

S"Mmm.. buffet.  The Wynn was the most highly recommended buffet in Vegas, and since this was my first time in Vegas, I had to go to at least one!  Dinner, however, seemed too expensive and breakfast seemed too expensive for breakfast food, so we decided to go for lunch one day.\n\nBottom line: it was worth it!  With tax, it comes to a bit less than $25, but you get sooooooo much food.  And it's good!  Asian, Italian, Seafood (ceviches), American, and so much more.\n\nMy favorite part was the sea bass which was cooked perfectly.  Incredible.  I could eat more and more and more of that.  I also liked the beef flank steak, and some other things.  I didn't get to try everything, but I came pretty close.  Then, to finish it off, I saw the dessert bar.  So.  Much.  Dessert.  I got one of everything that sounded remotely good to me, and tried it all.  The flavors of the desserts were pretty intense.  My favorite, surprisingly, was the oreo chocolate cake thing.  Usually don't love Oreo (though I don't dislike it either), but it was delicious!  I'd suggest getting a large spread and trying bits of everything and sharing with some people.\n\nThe only complaint I might have is that I was too uncomfortably full afterward.  Why, Wynn, why?!"

Prime Rim is the best, unexpectedly tender. Pasta Station is wonderful, good portions too. Sushi and Chinese stations are mediocre. Sea Bass and other hot seafood dishes are delicious, served in tiny bite size for better sampling. Save your appetite for deserts too. Creme Brulee, Tiramisu are on the top of my list.

But when we got in, we made the most of our $35 meal ticket.\n\n3 girls + 12 Alaskan King Crab Legs + a foolproof strategy to get the best food first = Simply Amazing!\n\nWe grabbed our plates and went for the food that mattered - red wine braised shortribs, shrimp cocktail, the aforementioned crab legs, lamb lollipops, ahi tuna, prime rib and about 6 desserts. The variety of food was superb, but stray away from the cooked fish. It was too dry. The best items were the crab legs and the lamb lollipops.\n\nYes. Happiness! This buffet is beautiful and the hotel is impeccable - I do recommend it even if the price is a bit high.   \n\nWalk around the hotel and casino afterward to help your meal digest.

S'I have been to the Wynn Buffet 2 or 3 times before this past visit  a couple days ago. I feel the need to speak up as I can no longer hold my silence here! This buffet was once pretty decent but I think it has gotten complacent and it reflect on the food. I had 3 Buffets on my recent visits to Vegas, Wynn Dinner, Treasure Island Lunch and Mandalay Bay Dinner and Wynn Dinner was worse than the Treasure Island buffet. By the way the Treausre Island Buffet I feel is VERY UNDERRATED!\n\nThe Sushi station at the Wynn was a HORRIFIC SITE, think costco freezer sushi 10 times worse! I could not tell if that was RICE on the sushi or white jello?\n\nCrab Legs, I know about the bulk buying but these Crab legs had no meat and was starting to smell?\n\nI will say the Prime Rib was quite decent and that is what the one star was for! However, I would say if Wynn is going to Charge $39 bucks , having one good item is not enough!\n\nAnd service was NON EXISTENT! No drink refills! I had to find the guy to take the plates!\n\nI read these glowing reviews and I just wonder if these people are too drunk to know their crab legs taste like my fish tank!'

But you know the saying - when in Rome - so when I saw the absurd amount of reviews for this place, I knew we had to check it out on our trip to Vegas.  For science's sake.    \n\nWe opted to do their breakfast buffet as our final stop on the Vegas-Food-Debauchery train before heading back to LA.  I figured it would be the best timing, thus ensuring we wouldn't need to eat anything on our journey home.  I was right.\n\nThe verdict?  I've never had such an overwhelming desire for more gastrointestinal real estate.  The food was delicious and, honestly, I was downright sad I couldn't eat more.  I was also impressed that they offered a number of gluten-free and vegan options among the 18 different pork products and the pastry/pancake/dessert mega-stations.  \n\nRemember to show up early and ask nicely to be seated in the atrium.

Also as far as buffets go, the Wynn was pricey. But considering that an overindulgence such as this ended up being a whole day's food intake, maybe the price isn't so bad after all.

S"Went here over the weekend for their special Friday/Saturday night dinner menu and there was barely anyone in line.  We normally go to the Bellagio buffet but this time we wanted to try something different.\n\nPros:  The desserts were good, definitely on par with Bellagio.  The prime rib was juicy and the au jus was good.  I'm weird and usually pour the au jus in a sauce bowl to dip my prime rib in instead of pouring it on top.  The rack of lamb was spiced up and a little spicy.  Different than the traditional spices at Bellagio, but good nonetheless.  They also did a lamb t-bone where the first piece was perfectly tender but the second piece was dry.\n\nSpecial Tip:  We like our crab legs hot and they serve it cold here.  I just take the crab legs and shrimp to the grill station and they turn out wonderfully grilled and warm.\n\nCons:  The crepe station was not worth the wait since everything just seemed cobbled together.  Our waitress didn't check on us often.  They only have one place for the king crab legs so there's usually a line.  It seemed like all of the fish dishes were heavily spiced, some to the point where it overwhelmed the fish and that's not good."

Every time I come ,  there are always new dishes I have never tried before....even new exotic meat.   One station I never pass is Alaskan King crab legs and jumbo shrimp cocktails.

Don't forget the mint jelly as condiment for the lamb.  \nLast but not least, SAVE YOUR TUMMY FOR DESSERT!!!!!   try their variety of pastries,  creme brule,  banana foster, and gelato.   \nDo I think $40 worth it??   Yes, every single bites of it.    The other buffet that rivals Wynn's is Belagio's.   \n\nSo.....why 4 stars..not 5?    On our last visit,   the host J@#@y  (not the waiter) wasn't that friendly.

We get there, and the line was long, wrapping around in a loop as if you were in an amusement park. (Tip: Get there early.) Good thing, I had cool people in the line with me to talk to which made the line and the time go by faster. \n\nI went there on a Saturday night, so I believe the prices are bumped up over the weekends. Expect to pay $41 per person. No senior discounts, since my mom qualified. Boo! Was it worth it? Ummm... I'm a vegetarian, so NO. But this dinner was not for me, it was for my mama. My mom liked it and she would go back if the prices were reasonable. \n\nThe setup was all right. I guess you can say it was setup more like a cafeteria style, where you get in line and wait for people to get their food. There were a variety of cuisines to choose from. So food-wise, there was a lot! Okay, so now to the desserts. I was excited when I saw that they make fresh crepes. I had the chef make me one, and I was not satisfied. It was horrible. I sampled pretty much all their desserts, and most were too dry or just didn't hit my palette the right way. Even though they had a wide selection of desserts, the only thing I liked was the coconut ice cream, the cr\xc3\xa8me brule, and one cheesecake. \n\nI like to try new things, so I'll try the buffet over at the Bellagio next time I'm in town."

Well....you would be WRONG. The applewood smoked bacon, chicken and apple sausage, delicious hash browns, and out of this world cheese blintzes were only a small sneak peek into how incredible this buffet was.

S"OK, here's my try at a comparative review of the Bellagio & Wynn dinner buffets - the two highest rated of the Vegas casino buffets (& the priciest). Was lucky to try both during my trip - reading previous reviews, looks like food selection varies slightly daily. My review is based on what I ate - there was alot that I did not try.\n\nPrice\n- Bellagio is cheaper ($30) vs Wynn ($35)\n\nInterior/Atmosphere\n- Liked Wynn better - garden decorations, more airy brighter & comfortable, less noisy. Bellagio layout seemed more packed & noisy.\n\nService\n- Wynn servers were faster & more attentive and efficient (refills, plate  removal, coffee). \n\nFood\n- Crab goes to Bellagio. Wynn only had split King Crab. Bellagio had King Crab & Snow crab. Both served the crab split & cold - straight from the box (Wynn server kept refilling the buffet straight from the box, they could have done this better). Flavor of both about the same, both very fresh tasting. Wynn provided drawn butter - Bellagio did not.\n\nShrimp was tie - great at both places.\n\n- Red Meat goes to Wynn. Wynn prime rib was seasoned better - Bellagio tasted like any other buffet. Both offered leg of lamb but was dry. Bellagio offered Kobe sirloin - not memorable. Wynn offered lamb t-bone & osso bucco, both dry.\n\n- Sushi goes to Bellagio. Wynn did not offer. Bellagio also offered Steak tartar - was not appealing or tasty.\n\n- Salad/Fruit/Cheese/Cold meats - tie. I did not eat any green salads or fruit. Salad layouts looked great - I'd rate them a tie. Wynn had cold meats - very nice. Cheese at Bellagio was very nice (esp for dessert).\n\nDesserts goes to Wynn. Preparation of the deserts was better & more variety - loved the mango lychee tapioca. Wynn had more variety & was nicely presented in individual plastic flutes. Coffee was hot at Bellagio, Wynn was warm.\n\nIn summary\n- Close Tie based on food alone. After trying both, I'm happy to report that both had very nice buffets & can highly recommend them both. If you are crunched for time & need to pick one, go for Wynn - based on atmosphere & service."

But quality was just so so. I tried everything, tHe only thing that was ok was the fried chicken breaded in a maple pancake dough or something. That was definitely different. It was free with our hotel. But if you have to pay it is way too much. It is like 86 for too people that is crazy. I think they price it high to keep people who are not from the hotel out.'

S"Went here with my mom and my aunt to eat dinner after our gambling round. I heard from a lot of my friends that this place was good, and i wanted to try it. We've been to other buffet around vegas before, like the one in rio and excalibur (i was too small back then to remember or review so next time) but yeah so this would be my first vegas buffet review.\n\nSo for dinner on a wednesday was 35 dollars per person. They had different types of food like asian, italian, indian, american, and DESSERT! The asian selection was eh...nothing special, the italian section was pretty cool cuz there's this guy there that could cook your food or you can just grab the ones that are already cooked on the side. The indian selection had hummus and some pita bread i think and curry salmon i think (soo good), Mash potato were awesome and some random meat and game. They had this pork slice which i liked but i didn't want to try other meats because some of them were really red. They had cool salad selections in a cup or you can make your own which was awesome!\n\nOh the crab legs or lobster legs or something were okay, they were cold though....i usually like them hot but my mom said only asian buffet serve the legs hot. DARN! \n\nBut the ultimate winner for me was the dessert area. OMG did i get every freaken thing in the area...well not everything but i think 70% lol. I had the tiramasu, the cookie and cream cake, the chocolate cake, the crepes (they make it for you!), Ice cream, cream brule? i think i spelled it wrong and tapioca pudding...i can't even remember them all but i brought every item to the table for my mom and my aunt and of course myself to eat off.\n\nYeah so the story.....buffett okay, wish they had more food (maybe it's just the weekday?) but the dessert won me over for a three star"

S"Normally I avoid buffets like a bad plague, but whenever I'm in Vegas, I try to stop here at least once, for one thing... the creme brulee.  I love it here, it's unlimited. It's not overly sweet, yet, has a nice caramelized top hiding a liquid creamy center.  I've eaten 8 in one sitting... in addition to prime rib, roast lamb, cocktail shrimp, easy split king crab legs.... you get the idea.  To mitigate the saltiness of crab legs, I peel a pile of them first and let it soak in lemon juice.  I love how the crab is so easy to peel!\n\nClarified butter, great salad selection, in clean colorful surroundings.  I'd give this place 5-stars, but it's just a bit too expensive compared to the other buffets around.  \n\nDessert has a grand selection, though half are bit too sweet for me.  But again, creme brulee is great, and I love the ice cream.  I get the coffee flavor with sliced almonds.  \n\nYou get lots of choices.  I'd avoid the Asian stuff... none of it was to my liking at all.  \n\nMy friends also enjoy coming here, but it might be wasted on a girl with a small appetite."

S"I'm not usually a buffet person, but when in Vegas, it seems it's the thing to do.  As far as buffets go, this is the best one I've ever been to, in Vegas or anywhere else.  I've only been for breakfast/brunch, but I can't imagine that dinner isn't on the same level.\n\nThey literally have EVERYTHING you could possibly want.  There is traditional breakfast food , fresh fruit, these amazing little hash brown balls with chives in them, an entire bakery in the center (try the cinnamon rolls!), omelettes made to order, Asian food, Mexican food, seafood, a carving station, and the list goes on.  Both times I came I happened to be at breakfast, on the cusp of lunch, so I got to try both.  When lunch came they put out mini sandwiches, marinated steak tips, all kinds of salads, pasta, cheeses...it would be overwhelming, except each station has a huge sign over it telling you exactly what it is so you can easily navigate your way around.\n\nThe service was excellent, with our dirty plates cleared each time within minutes.\n\nObviously it's a buffet, so there aren't going to be too many culinary suprises, but everything they do, they do well.  It's all fresh, hot, perfectly cooked, beautifully presented, and most importantly- delicious."

S'I am a bit confused by so many four and five star reviews on this buffet?! Have these people never been to a buffet before? Are they just mesmerized because they are at the Wynn and it looks pretty? Possibly they are just blindsided by the price they just paid? Whatever the case may be, this is the most overrated buffet in Las Vegas! Come on they couldn\'t even come up with a name for it, did they really think it was cute to call it "The Buffet"?\n\nThere is not a great selection of anything and yet they charge you like you are going to be feasting on miles of delectable tastes and treats. Once they get you in, it\'s pure let down and you can begin at the frozen snow crab and room temperature sushi. But hey if your not a fan of seafood that\'s okay because you can always try the pasta bar, I hope you like penne or rotini because that\'s all the pasta they have and if you like barley warm sauce that taste like its  from a jar then you\'re in luck, they can serve you up the best pasta ever! Let\'s just say my days of making fun of the Olive Garden\'s fettuccine alfredo are no longer after this experience! If you still haven\'t found something that looks tasty, then just hit up the tried and true salad bar, because like at any buffet there is always the salad bar where you can make a giant salad and pile on the toppings, except of course here they have even managed to ruin the salad bar! They have the smallest salad bar ever with no selection of anything, which really sucks if your a vegetarian because almost all of the very few options that they do have at this buffet have meat in them! So mashed potatoes and veggie tamales for me it was. What topped off this dismal buffet was our dismal server, not one soda refill and he was nowhere in sight all evening.\n\n\nAt the end of the night I was just grateful that Mr. Wynn only took us for $30 to experience all that is The Buffet, because if I would have had to pay full price for my family of four I may have shot myself!'

YEAHH.\nFood:\nPrime Rib - tender as ever can be\nLamb Racks - so much flavor\nOysters -  ehhh, but w/e its oysters\nAlaskan King Crab - so rich and succulent\n\nThose were some of the main highlighted food at this buffet that I would eat for the rest of my life. All the other foods are just as good as well.\n\nTheir desserts are outta this world too. The strawberry sorbet and other gelatos are really good. The key lime pie mousse is crazy too should try that one out.\n\nThe food is without question great. The only thing holding this back from 5 stars is that the service is just ehh and the tables are extremely tight. They fit 4 people into a really small square table that can barely fit more than 1 plate per person. And with the drinks and other condiments on the table as well, it's pretty tightly packed.\n\nOther than that, the ambiance and atmosphere is great inside the Wynn Buffet. A must try if you're in Vegas. Might as well gamble for 5 minutes less, take that $20 and spend it here!"

S'I\'ve been reading some of the many 3 star or less reviews and I must say that I am flabbergasted by the unwarranted criticism. Not only did this buffet meet my lofty expectations, it blew them away. \n\nThe decor is spectacular. The hotel is as classy as they come (you can buy a Ferrari for crying out loud). And, the food. My god the food! I\'ve never in my life had such delicious cuisine. \n\nWhat I ate:\n\nI started with a salad. It was some kind of kale concoction. I\'m not usually a salad man, but this was really quite good. \n\nAfter whetting my appetite, I headed to the soup section. I tried the chicken soup which was delectable. \n\nI then proceeded to the sliced meats area where I picked up some prosciutto. It was pleasant. \n\nFrom there I visited the seafood section. I tried some fish which wasn\'t mind-blowing, but was still perfectly edible. However, I also had a seafood pot-pie which was exceptional. The flaky crust was complimented by a subtle cream sauce that made this dish a favorites for me.\n\nHaving tried seafood, I stopped at the Italian area where I tried the cracked egg and ham pizza, and lasagna. Both were to die for. The pizza may not sound appetizing, but believe you me, it is.\n\nFrom there I continued my gluttonous tour by visiting the sushi/crab area. I picked up a bit of tempura shrimp and a mound of crab legs. The sushi was merely adequate. But the crab legs were amazing. I could honestly have eaten 2 or 3 more plates full. \n\nFinally, I discovered the dessert area. I began this stage with an ice cream sandwich. But this was no ordinary ice cream sandwich. The mint chocolate chip gelato (one of many gelatos on offer) was placed between two gourmet chocolate chip cookies that tasted like heaven. \n\nNext I sampled their creme brulee. It was made to perfection. \n\nI also had a cream puff, some vanilla gelato, and a bit of carrot cake. All of these were of high quality as well. \n\nNow, I know what you\'re thinking. This man couldn\'t possibly have eaten all that! I assure you that I did. I am 6\'3" with an appetite to match my stature. Honestly, I could have eaten much more, so delicious was the food. But, I didn\'t want to make any more of a spectacle of myself. \n\nAll in all the experience was phenomenal. As for the reviewers giving negative feedback, I can only surmise that their expectations are completely unrealistic.'

It's just how I feel...cruise buffets, casino buffets, asian buffets....the most any buffet would get out of me so far is 3.5.  This is a solid 3.  I came here on Chinese New Year.  My friend had heaped praises on this particular menu, so I decided to give it a try.  We happened to arrive near the end of lunch, and so got a better deal for our dinner.  The lunch was not all that memorable.  The food was all very solid.  I enjoyed the lox.  The candy apple, though indeed very pretty, was not that great.  Neither were the madeleines.  None of the other desserts were outstanding.  The dinner didn't seem very asian-ified to me.  It was more like they threw in a few asian dishes to their normal fare.  I think that this buffet is comparable to the Bellagio's and better than Paris Casino's buffet.  The M Casino buffet better suits my taste.  There were many items there that I thought were good."

Pretty much everything was old. I'm eating with 3 people who all hate their food as well. Even buffets with shitty food are usually ok in some ways but this place has nothing good to offer. The food doesn't even look appetizing to start with. The only thing that looks decent is the desserts but I haven't tried them just yet so 2 stars for that.

I understand that they have to pay their employees more during the holidays but it doesn't mean they have to take it on their customers. In my point of view, they could have not charged more than the regular price and they probably would have had double their sales through the holidays. Let's give back to the community eh?

The Chef personally showed us what was Vegan and what they can make for us.\nLike:\nPizza, We only wanted one slice from that big pizza so it seemed kinda a waste so we took 2 each. I was walking around and found few more people that were vegan so I didnt feel too bad after that.  My first vegan pizza was just alright. It had so much veggies on it so i had to take all the bell peppers off. Also vegan cheese for the first time... it was very different and ... slimy =/ but it was good. My Vegan friend didnt like the cheese or the pizza. it was just alright.\n\nThe next personalized food was the soup. They gave us tomato soup. I thought it was just okay too... bland and my friend doesnt even like tomato soup! HAHAHA.\n\nSo since i was the meat eater I just had to try a little bit of everything haha! well i felt bad after cuz i got so much just to try and it was thrown away after one bite =(\nat least the piggy will be well fed lol. Some food was good and some were dry =( \n\nDessert was alright too, the hard candy apple was soft in the middle (not crispy) so ew.

That's really the only reason why it's not a 5.

I had dinner here with my family the night before Christmas eve. We got in line at about 8:40 and it took up probably 40 mins to get in from the line up. I'm not gonna go into too much detail since there's already about 900 people who wrote page long reviews before me.\n\nMain point: This buffet is not the most expensive I've been to nor is it anywhere close to being the most extensive.

If you don\'t want to wait, go to Treasure Island and you\'ll go in with no wait... you whiny bitches.\n\nThe service was great.

I have to tell you, if you\'re on a diet, \n1) BREAK IT FOR THIS!\n2) ... why are you in Vegas?\n3) Then again, if you are, eat wisely. They have tastily-prepared vegetables and sweet, fresh fruits to balance your gorging. (:\n\nHonestly, not everything will be perfect. There will be a few things that are just okay. Some are good and great. And the rest? Those foods were crafted to perfection. \n\nIf you\'re a seafood person, you should definitely line up for their ginormous pile of fresh king crab legs. I\'ve only gone to this buffet twice, but both times, there are tons of people who are willing to wait in the lines and fill up an entire plate or two with them (although, people like that, such as my parents, regret getting so much a bit after they remember there are other well-prepared foods surrounding them lol).\n\nI\'ll be honest, when at buffets, I don\'t do the whole "eat all I can" thing with the appetizers and entrees. For me, it\'s all about the desserts. They have their homemade ice creams/gelatos/sorbets. Not only were there cookies and cakes... there were candied apples! They looked beautiful, but I was past my stomach\'s limit to sink my teeth into them. \n\n5 stars for variety, taste, service, and cleanliness.'

S"Went to eat at the Wynn Buffet and it was worth the 40-minute wait. Then we joined the Encore's Red Club, played slots and blackjack, won $475 and got comped two free buffets. We pleaded with the player's club rep and he gave us two VIP front of the line tickets. I haven't felt this happy about skipping a line since I got a Magic Express pass at the Magic Kingdom!  \n\nIs it worth the wait anyway? Absolutely yes! I greedily piled on the King Crab legs and peeled shrimp. Talk about being treated right: good-sized shrimp and they even split the crab legs so you don't have to wrestle with the poor creatures. One surprise--no drawn butter.\n\nWe sat both times in the nice courtyard by the entrance. More peaceful than in the main rooms, although there is the guilt factor of being able to see the hungry people waiting in line. Other advantage is that we had to walk past the desserts on the way back to the table, so we grabbed something each time we passed. Formula for success: Eat a course, eat desserts, repeat! And what yummy desserts, better than any other Vegas buffet. \n\nWas it perfect? No, but pretty close for a buffet. Staff was attentive and friendly. List of foods and desserts we liked would be too long to describe here. Highlights for us? Mushroom soup, grilled flank steak, bread pudding, creme brulee, tiramisu, and on and on.\n\nWhat didn't I like? On the first visit for brunch, seemed like food could have been hotter. Char siu bao (steamed pork buns) had very little meat and very little flavor.  Tried the prime rib carving. Yuck! Way too much fat and no meat. \n\nWould definitely go again. Would really liked to be comped again. Would really like to win $475 again."

S"My husband and I were staying at the Venetian, vacationing in Vegas for the first time. We wanted to try some of the best buffets. We came here based on the Yelp reviews.\n\nWe came for dinner on a Sunday evening around 5pm. We walked from the Venetian to the Wynn. Didn't take long. However, we waited in line for about 15 minutes. \n\nCompared to the Wicket Spoon, this place didn't have enough variety. It also wasn't as big, hence the wait. The food was good however.\n\nThe decor is beautiful when you first come in to the restaurant. The Wynn is a beautiful place overall. Reminded me of something from Alice and Wonderland. I recommend The Buffet, but try the Wicket Spoon as well."

We gorged on rice porridge (Asian style) with preserved egg and youtiao, bacon, ham and cheese, cornbread, mixed greens, brunch items, ceviche, lettuce wrap, etc. We coincidentally stayed through 3:30 where they switch to dinner almost instantly. We managed to get some crab legs and ribs (which I heard was really good but I was too full to try it out). I had some melons and a mint cake for dessert. The food was heavenly and I can see why it's the place to go. Might be the best buffet I've ever had."

S'I eat at a different Las Vegas buffet once a week. This was my 2nd dinner at Wynn Buffet and second disappointed. Currently Wynn Buffet offers worst value in Las Vegas. Most of the food they have is great except for crab legs which were small and dry, though there may be some dry spell on those because Planet Hollywood had the same problem with crab legs recently. However, the main issue is simply lack of food selection. No ribs, no roast, no brisket, no mushrooms, no fruit, and no many other things that I enjoy at other local buffets, not even strawberries that other reviewers mentioned. I could get filled up with mashed potatoes and prime rib, but that\'s not why I\'m paying $35 for a buffet. My family also couldn\'t find much to eat, which was a huge letdown. We all much prefer Spice Market Buffet at Planet Hollywood, Green Valley Buffet, and others at lower prices.\n\nBTW, people serving Caesar salad at Wynn look just ridiculous. I saw two customers  trying to explain how much salad they want to squeeze on their already half-filled plates, and going back and forth "little less", "little more", instead of getting themselves as much salad as they want. Come on, is this place so snobby that patrons wouldn\'t know how to handle their own salad? This might be great bit for a next comedy blockbuster though.'

S"I came here on a Sat night for dinner. I've been reading about this buffet as being as the ultimate buffet in Vegas, not to mention its constant comparison to the Bellagio buffet. Sadly, so sadly, bf and I were so disappointed with their food selection. I guess we should not have joined in so much on the hype. I mean, I even planned days to drive to Vegas just to eat here, I know, right.\n\nAnyways, here are some of the things I remember having:\n-Crab legs, what's new.\n-Shrimp tempura sushi and california rolls-- that's it! wtf? For 40 bucks a person, they should at least have some nigiri.They also had smoked salmon, which I'm not fan of. The rolls were typical buffet rolls, stale and weird.\n-Naan and curry- these were good.\n-Sea bass\n-That's all I can rmbr. It was not that significant.\n-No oysters for all you oyster lovers.\n\nFor dessert, they had the typical.. gelato.. creme brulee.. cookies, etc. They didn't even have french macaroons! :(\n\nSo basically, they did not have a great food selection. I loved Spice Market at PH, Paris' buffet and Studio B at The M 10x better than this place. Definitely will not be returning, especially at their ridiculous price of $40/person."

My girlfriend who had creme brulees in Paris said that these were even better.  In terms of variety, this place definitely has variety.  Almost all buffets are similar to another in Vegas.  The usual seafood section, the usual asian food and american food, pastries and dessert and etc.  However, the difference in the quality and the food here by far beats out those at the other hotels like Mirage, Luxor or what not.  The only place I really have not yet compared it to would be the Bellagio buffet.  \n\nI was disappointed that the costs was kind of pricey.  I'm not sure if it was the season prices or what not, but I remember it costing us around $40 something for each of us when we went between christmas and new years.  And it would've been better if there was lobster, but even without it, the food here is as good as it gets."

S'Buffets should end with you smiling and patting your belly, after having unbuttoned your pants to fit in one last round. When u find yourself at your table sharing the same look with your friends: that blank stare out to nowhere, playing with your food and wondering why you didn\'t spend that 25 bucks on the Monopoly or Sex and the City slot machine or all red, you know u ain\'t happy. \nWhat sucks is that, we came here as our last hurrah lunch before heading home, having eaten many delicious meals- we were pretty disappointed.\nI should have listened to my gut feeling after seeing rates of this place dropping in their latest yelp reviews.  It wasn\'t unsavory looking as the lower end "buffet of buffets" buffets, but it certainly made me wonder what i would be getting if i spent that 40 bucks for dinner on a peak day. Would it be that much better? Or more of the same stuff... A whole station devoted to tortilla chips with only red and green salsa was a bit of a turnoff. \nThe dishes i did enjoy were some pork slider thing, leek dumpling, bacon, and hashbrown ball. They had a small selection of Thai and indian food which you dont\' find everywhere- but they were ordinary.  What we found ourselves doing, was mixing up some of the dry dishes with the saucy items to make things more interesting... eating our cookies with the icecream or frosting off the cupcakes. The mini cupcakes were cute http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=uJVqblRmMmvsl3P6pkU_KA, frosting was ok, but i am not a huge fan of glitter on my cupcakes. but since we were in vegas, where glitter is a common accessory- i ate it anyways. Frosting was not bad!\nAtleast it was very pretty in the atrium where we were seated!http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=VIoLtKLPGWmd-H5HZBNDRQ\n\nWicked spoon is still better and i need to go back to M Buffet, which i remember was pretty good a couple of years ago. \n\n*UPDATED PRICE INFO FOR BUFFET: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2weQS-RnoOBhb1KsHKyoSQ?select=IAjMHTukj1EFSbL6WILEgg'

We had the special NYE buffet, which included steamed LOBSTER!\n\nHubby and I proceeded to devour plate after plate of steamed lobster, king crab legs, and cocktail shrimp.\n\nI have to say, it was the best buffet experience I've had in Vegas. And Hubby agrees. Another bonus was that we didn't even have to wait in line at all, which almost never happens at the good buffets in Vegas.\n\nNeedless to say, we both had massive food coma and had to go up to the room to digest (him) and pass out for an hour (me). I did wake up in time to watch Jersey Shore and see Snooki get punched in the face, and eventually I was able to crawl out of bed to watch the fireworks, but the food coma ensured that watching fireworks was all that we had the energy to do for NYE.\n\nAdvice: Just because it's a buffet, even if they have steamed lobster, doesn't mean you have to stuff yourself until you blow up."

Dinner comes with king crab legs that are cracked for you. Prime rib cut to taste, sushi, fresh shrimp, veal shortribs. I can go on and on but you get the point. The deserts are phenomenal with creme brulee and crepes and candied apples. No sense in wasting money on any other buffet when you have this one.

The decor in the place is really beautiful and airy; reminded me of an upscale English cottage with the color scheme. Although it's a buffet, you still get table service (for drinks and such), so you'll have to tip extra if you do actually order something. \n\nThe food itself was ok, but lacking something in my opinion. We scoured the pictures on here before coming and it all looked amazing. While the food all looked pretty and there was a large selection to choose from, it wasn't as tasty as I had hoped. I'm more of a quality over quantity kind of person. Of course, I still ate enough to feed an army. Hey, it's a buffet. \n\nLunch on a Monday ran about $50 for the two of us. Add $10 drinks each with tip for the table service, it was too much for a Monday buffet lunch. It was a nice experience and left us in satisfying food comas, but I'll probably try a different buffet next time I'm in town."

No, guys, the Wynn Buffet is not cheap, but it is, in my opinion the best buffet on the strip, hands down. \n\nThe minute I walked in, I felt like I was in heaven. I walked straight to where the king crabs legs were at, and filled my plate to the rim. For a lazy person such as myself, I'm so grateful that they minimized the work for me and sliced the legs in half, and all had to do was pull the meat out. Seriously, all of the food were delicious, especially the prime rib! And, omg, their desset section is to die for! I literally grabbed everything because they all looked sooo good. Their creme brulee, omg... it's like orgasm in your mouth.\n\nTake my advice, stop by here on your last day in Vegas, because you'd want to eat and stuff yourself and get your money's worth, and by doing so, I doubt you'll be able to fit into your clubbing dress after, so if I were you, I'd eat here on my last day in Sin City, because I know I don't have to worry about trying to fit into my clubbing dress later that night, haha."

S"Was here most recently during 4th of July weekend.  I think the Wynn buffet is one of the best in Vegas, up there w/Bellagio.  Like most LV buffets, there is plenty of variety (Italian, American, Asian, seafood) something for everyone.  It's somewhat pricey, but if you are into buffets then you'll probably like this one.\n\nThe pasta dishes were pretty good, though I tend to stay away from such dishes at buffets.  The prime rib was good, not dry, and the medium rare piece i requested was actually medium rare!  They also served rack of lamb, beef tenderloin, fried chicken, and other meat dishes as well.  The dinner menu includes crab legs, and the line gets long once the legs are brought out.  Besides the crab legs they have sushi (avg at best), various fish dishes, prawns and cocktail shrimp.  Except for the sushi, all the seafood mentioned above were good.  Don't even need the butter for the crab legs.  I also liked the beef ribs, very flavorful, tender, falls-right-off-the-bone goodness.\n\nThe dessert area also has a nice variety:  creme brulee, candy apples, an ice cream bar w/various flavors and toppings, pastries, cookies, fruit, various slices of cakes and pies."

S'The environment was good, but unfortunately the food was completely opposite. For the money (Diner-$38+/person)  I would much rather have gone elsewhere. For starters the sushi was inedible the rice was all mushy and the variety of sushi was disappointing. The next issue was the prime rib, it was so tough it felt like I was chewing on old bubble gum. The tri-tip was more tender but, it was fairly dry. There were no fish items present but, there was mushy shrimp and crab legs. The Italian food consisted of pasta and pizza. Both were ok but, certainly not excellent. Lastly the dessert selection was very bland. I felt that their only good dessert was the gelato. \n\nOverall my experience was satisfactory but, I definitely expected more from a world class hotel.'

The rest of the seafood was also excellent, particularly the jumbo shrimp. Red meats were pretty good: I liked the prime rib a lot, though others thought it too rare and/or fatty, preferring the lamb dishes (rack and leg). I thought the salads were better than the cooked vegetables. Desserts were poor: I found only the ice cream to be passable.\n\nBest strategy might just be to grab what's been freshly cut."

S'In a word: disappointing.  After reading some reviews that placed this consistently in the top five buffets, we decided to give this a try.\n\nWe went on the 26th after Christmas for an early dinner to avoid the crowd.  The line was about one hour (3:30pm until 4:30 when we were seated).  $200 for four adults.\n\nBy appearances it could be nice with 15 or so stations with a lot of variety.  Unfortunately no coffee station for the price!  \n\nSalad:  not appetizing or original at all.  Skip.\n\nItalian: the lobster ravioli was okay, polenta not good, gnocchi no good.  \n\nThe grill:  prime rib okay, lamb chops adequate (a fresh roast came out and that was good, the first one was tough and dry).\n\nChilled seafood:  probably the only thing that was worth it.  Oysters, crab legs and shrimp cocktail.  Difficult to mess up.  \n\nSushi bar:  sadly inedible.   The rice was the wrong texture and fish not fresh.  Ahi tuna poke was not sashimi grade fish -- this would not have been served in a good restaurant anywhere.  The grilled calamari with lime dressing was okay.\n\nDesserts:  not bad but it was disappointing without a coffee bar.  Some highlights here:  a profiterole, creme br\xc3\xbbl\xc3\xa9e, various small cakes.  Avoid the bread pudding.\n\nAll in all, this would have been good for $20 with no wait.  For $50 save your money and just go to a good sit down restaurant.  \n\nWhen we left the line looked about 2+ hours! oh sorry.  Their disappointment was probably way worse than ours.'

None of that quantity over quality stuff.  It's all quality here at the Wynn in Las Vegas. If that isn't enough to convince you to give it try, they say you have a 2 hour time limit. However, that is only if they are packed with people. If there is enough seating then stay as long as dinner permits (3pm-10pm actually) or until they kick you out.\n\nIn general anything you get here will taste above average; however, that may be an understatement, it is gourmet food after all. I feasted on endless amounts of crab, shrimp, prime rib, rib eye, lamb, and sorbet. YUM! The meats were cooked medium but you can ask for it differently and boy were they juicy. The seafood was awesome, and the sorbet was amazing as well.\n\nOverall: the service was friendly, the decorations look like you're in Wonder Land, and the food was amazing.

S'Two schools of thought exist for this place: it\'s the best, and it\'s not the best but far from the worst. This is quite an achievement for ANY business, especially a food service business.\n\nLet\'s be quite frank: food service sucks. Working in it sucks. Waiting in line to pay $40 and being anything but thrilled or compensated the expectation you thought you deserved...well, sucks!\n\nThe facts are that the food on loan to your stomach has great variety and first quality. I had the most buttery prime rib ever, and you can wait in line to get shrimp, octopus, crab legs (pre cut, in half, and easy to feed on) and other seafoods.\n\nAs my second visit in about 3 years, I couldn\'t recall if there was an Indian food feature the first time I went, but this time they had the most unsightly Indian food section ever. It certainly didn\'t look like Indian food. They used supermarket pita bread, all the wrong food dyes, and like the rest of Vegas, it just seemed to be contrived.\n\nHowever, it tasted AMAZING. How did they pull it off? If you are reading this review on your cell while waiting in line, and have a hankering for "dahl" (lentils in a kind of pea soup), save some room in your stomach.\n\n4 stars for quality disregarding price (too much, hit the Paris buffet for a cheaper experience with a greater array of foods), and waiting in line for at least 1.5 hours on a weekday. Those prior two reasons are why it\'s not a full 5 stars.\n\nBe not mistaken: the Wynn buffet is overrated. But that\'s not their fault. Nobody\'s going to say the food sucks, and that\'s what makes this place so phenomenal.'

Be prepared for a very long wait no matter what time of year/day.  \n\nI actually preferred the taste of the "cheaper" stuff; the risotto, pheasant, and corn cake were tastier to me than the raw seafood (king crab, seared tuna & scallop). Of the desserts, the macarons were surprisingly good and the caramel ice cream was perfect with chunks of candy bar mixed in. \n\nOverall I thought that it was ok; I\'ll be trying the Bellagio buffet next time, which I remember being better.'

However, they served some items from dinner to breakfast the next day...same with their dessert..they have a massive selection but some items were like mainstay...so if we eat here 4 times for 4 days...we will not see much difference from the menu..'

S"The Buffet, what a perfect name for the obvious.  Haha.  I got there around lunch time and it was $25.  Had to wait in a line but it didn't seem to take forever.  What made it nice was looking into the beautiful atrium room.  I overheard someone say that's for the high rollers, IDK?  But either way it was very pretty to look at.\n\nNow the buffet.  It was one of the largest I've ever been too.  It was like the length of a Walmart.  International food selections, Asian, Italian, American, Mexican and dessert.  \n\nI really enjoyed everything except their pizza, so gross!  I made sure to portion out my food so I had enough room for dessert.  Tried their gelato and tiramisu was my favorite dessert.  Interestingly my favorite was making a spring salad.  It tasted so good.  Yes everything else was bomb to eat, but those were my favs.\n\nBathrooms, expect a line.  But you get your own private stall with doors covering from floor to ceiling.  Make all the noise you want.  Just run with a blushing cheeks as you face the next person who has to smell your after buffet results.  Get er' done, it's Vegas, and it stays in Vegas Baby!!!!"

S"Very posh for a buffet! The real/synthetic ostrich skin material covering the walls/seats/benches of this buffet is really over the top. All the surfaces are clean-very refreshing for a buffet.\n\nLooks like the trick for all these buffets are to arrive at the meal switchovers so that you can get lunch/dinner menus at the lower lunch price. We waited a solid 1.5 hours for dinner but it was worth the wait.\n\nI was surprised that the variety of food selections wasn't mind blowing, but rather each item seemed to be pretty high quality. The prime rib was excellent. And of course can't forget to mention the crab legs. This is where you can try to make up the cost of entry, which was $98 for two. Also make sure to save room for dessert!!!!\n\nquick sum: great quality buffet but pretty pricey. worth trying at least once!"

S'Holy moly.  I must have been shuffled to the a parallel universe or something.  I think this buffet was terrible.\n\nThere\'s hardly any meat.  There\'s prime rib and bacon (fancy, I guess) for the carving table.  There was some seafood laying around.  Tiny bits of chicken.  The "Asian" section had lotus leaf sweet rice, super dry white rice, congee and chau sau bau (sp?  pork buns).  Very lacking.  Overall, the problem is that there is a lot of fancy bits but it is prepared pretty poorly.  Lots of dry food with poor taste.  As for the sushi bar... please all you would be sushi chefs and buffet managers... IT\'S THE FRICKIN\' RICE!!!  IT MUST BE PREPARED PROPERLY AND NOT MUSHY AND EXCEEDINGLY VINEGARY.  Bad rice will completely counteract even the best and freshiest fish in the world.  I can\'t stress how important the preparation of sushi rice is!  Are you listening Clubhouse of Costa Mesa?  \n\nThe dessert station reportedly had only four desserts.  I was too busy choking after a taste of the super dry rice that got caught in my gullet to check it out.\n\nOn top of that, it was $33 for a Sunday brunch (no champagne, it is a few bucks extra) and the wait was reportedly an hour and a half (at 10:30am on a Sunday morning).  If I wasn\'t partially comped and given a line pass to bypass this horrific wait, I probably would have been pretty pissed off.  Even still, paying 33 for three still made me feel ripped off.  It sucked that bad.\n\nI actually think some of the "lesser" buffets are much better, such as Harrahs, Bally\'s etc.\n\nIt is too bad since the place is looks nice and the Wynn is a pretty classy joint.  I don\'t know what happened, but the first year the Wynn was in operation, the buffet was through the roof.  For some reason, it has gone down hill steadily and has now fallen off a cliff.'

S'I was at the buffet a few years ago and it was fantastic.  I remember lamb chops, baby back ribs, and white anchovies for the "made to order Caesar salad."  Maybe because my recent visit was on a weekday the selection was limited and was not what I expected.  I felt that $40 was way too high considering the men u items.  Yes the prime rib was "good" and the turkey was excellent but everything else was what I would expect from any buffet.  There was Kobe Beef....."Meatloaf???" and bland Indian food.  The 3 dim sum selections were fine as was the offering of 2 sushi items.  There were other fish selections as well as pork tenderloin, and would have rated higher, but did not think that the spread was $40 worthy.  I gave three stars because the deserts were excellent and loaded up on those.  I would have'

S'For all you "foodies" out there, I think you could be bold to label this place heaven. I don\'t know what beats great food - oh yeah - great food in a buffet! That my friends, is what The Buffet at the Wynn is all about. \n\nMy friends and I went during a Saturday night. For all of you out there, please take note that Friday and Saturday nights are the better nights to go because in these two nights, they put out on the buffet RACK OF LAMB - and yes my friends, you can eat all the rack of lamb that you want. I had no shame to ask the carver for 5 pieces in my first showing at the station. Then there the make your own risotto station.\n\nHonestly, you WILL stay 2-3 hours here because of all the food. Its worth every minute and every dollar you spend. As Joey says in the Vegas episode in FRIENDS, "This is where I win all my money back!" Well, you may not win everything back, but at least you\'ll leave satisfied and craving a few hours later, for more rack of lamb.'

I love coming to this buffet because everything is also kept super clean.  I always see the chefs behind the counts wiping down the trays and counters from the mess we make while serving ourselves.  \n\nThey have a wide variety from sushi, seafood, the grill to Italian. \n\nEverything here is very tasty and great. I always judge the buffets by their shrimp cocktail since that's always my favorite thing to go for... and they always have jumbo, clean and perfectly cooked shrimp ready. \n\nThis is the place for some perfect hunger filling up to do. \nMy one complaint, the people working the front counter taking your money, they're always so moody and rude."

S"The Buffet by The Wynn fell short of buffet perfection in many ways.  The interior of The Buffet feels dated, from the furniture and lighting to the large fake flower show pieces, I was reminded of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, the 1971 version.\n\nThe quality of the food was mixed. I really enjoyed the carved beef and roasted brussels sprouts, but couldn't find any fruit except the grapes that were garnish for the charcuterie station.  The salad station was very poorly managed.  All of the prepared salads were picked over or empty both times I went by and the desserts were nothing special, a little dry and mostly too sweet.\n\nIf you do try The Buffet, take your time and find the things you want to eat."

I went for lunch, but was able to stay past 330 when they started bringing out dinner food (hahaha).  For lunch they served huge jumbo shrimp, ceviche (even the shrimp in the ceviche was big), cali rolls, prime rib, asian food, etc.  For dinner they started bringing out the big daddy king crab legs, and lamb chops.  the lamb was smokin delicious.  In total, my friends stayed there from 1:30pm to around 4pm.  The service was excellent as well.  Highly recommend it if you're ready to stuff your face in some good food."

The crab legs/shrimp section was a bit of a hot mess too with a line of people suspiciously eyeing anyone they thought might be trying to cut.  A carafe of warmed butter for your crab legs? Oh my!  \n\nAlthough the crab legs were huge and pre-split, which I love, the meat was very wet and tasted like it had just been defronsted, which is yucky.  Unless you can eat your worth in crab legs/shrimp, I don't know that it's worth coming here.  It may be a better bet to try a normal restaurant."

S'Not the ordinary buffet that you\'re expecting.  I asked the lady up front, "Is this quality or quantity?"  She said, "Mr. Wynn only expects the best in his hotel."  She was right.  You really get more than 6 themes of food that range from average to above average in taste.  We\'re talking Chinese to Indian to what I like to call the Thanksgiving section.  The most impressive part was the dessert area.  It had almost everything you could thing of.  ex. crepes, ice cream sundaes, creme brulees, and the list goes on.  I was bummed that there wasn\'t lobster, but they did have snow crab legs.  Definitely worth the money!!!'

S"They should have a big ass sign on the left stations that says in big bold letters: BEWARE OF ASIANS LOADING UP ON CRAB AND SEAFOOD.  \n\nThere's something for everyone at the Wynn buffet - I've been here enough times to know that the following items will be awesome and worth the price of admission alone:  the cheeses, charcuterie and olives, smoked salmon, gelato, creme brulee (note how shallow the dish is? that's deliberate so as to maximize the caramelized sugar to custard ratio), sauteed morning glory.  \n\nWhat mostly keeps Wynn from five stars is the fact that I'm usually not that impressed by the prime rib and other carvery. Often I get stuck with the brown ass ends.  I'm probably not AZN enough to swoop in when the meat is pink and glistening.  \n\nAlso, the attempts of the buffet to represent various ethnic cuisines is admirable but come on, this is Vegas!  You really expect baba ghanoush made by an assembly line in the 702 to taste like the real thing? There's a ton of other stuff in the buffet that they might as well just not even try to make - they just look sad (ie., the million cerviches, pastas, and other misc. filler cafeteria style dishes).  \n\nOn the other hand, the smoked salmon is the best I've ever had - there is not even a trace of fishiness and there's a million accouterments that can accompany it. And the other before mentioned things are really really really damn good.  \n\nSave some room for dessert! The crepes and gelato are a lot of fun."

S"Went here twice last weekend. Yup, it was that good.\n\nIt is pretty pricy, but if you are a big eater, you can definitely take advantage of this awesome buffet.\nFor dinner, they had Prime Rib, Lamb T-Bone Steaks (two kinds.. one with a dry rub and another with sauce), Alaskan King Crab Legs (a bit hit!), ribs, Kobe Beef Meatloaf (WHY did they make it into meatloaf), and few other meaty options. For an extra $10, you can get UNLIMITED champagne, mimosas or (I think) Bloody Mary's. I finished a mimosa every 10 minutes while we ate there, and got a pretty good buzz by the end of our meal.\n\nFor Saturday brunch, they still had the Prime Rib, they had some crazy pepper crusted thick cut bacon (forgot which sauce came with it, but it was so peppery that it overpowered the sauce), and some amazing Salmon! They always have Smoked Salmon here, a Chinese food station, and a Mexican food station. The dessert section is crazy!!! It's like a separate dessert store. Numerous choices of dessert and 6 flavors of Gelato too!! Wow. I could go on about what other options were there, but it was awesome. Go. That's the bottom line.\n\nIt is really, really busy here during regular hours..so either go at opening time or just cope with waiting in line. A full line (out to the entrance) will go through in about 30-40 minutes. When they are busy, you will probably have to wait a bit to get a refill on your waters or mimosas. While you wait... eat! :)"

I have been fortunate to dine in several of there restaurants and cafe.\nMy boyfriend and I went to the lunch buffet, 2/5/13 as one of his events for his bday. He had been to the dinner one about 6 years ago. He absolutely loved which is why we decided to go.\nWe started with sushi side...one word yuck!. All of the rice was hard. The tuna ceviche was nicely presented but the dish didn't have any flavor.\nAfter the first disappointment we decided to continue to other sections, the Asian, the meats, Pasta, Italian pizza all had the same problem. Something was missing for taste, salt, pepper, love. Again everything looked great but the,taste was not there. On top of that some of the hot food we would get was salad cold by the time we sat. Given we were seated up close and personal and were only going per section so the food was on our plate for no more than a minute before we sat down. \nAfter courses of disappointments we decided let's get full with desserts, I mean there is no way those good looking desserts must be good. Well think again, we tried tres leches, Madeline, chocolate cake you name it we tried it, again sugar or something was missing. \nFinally we couldn't help it but  complain to the manager. Which than brought out the Executive Chef. Both were friendly, the chef was willing to make anything we wanted how ever we wanted. We would have done it but we were too scare at that point. Than the manager said because we had been there for over an hour it becomes iffy. So they have us free espresso. At that point I just didn't care anymore. So we drank our sorry espresso and went on our way. Still love the Wynn but won't be going to there lunch buffet  ever again."

Few of us were turned away after learning the actual prices (about $34 per person for Sunday brunch) but some of us endured. After waiting about 45 minutes in the line, we were finally there. \n\nThe first thing you notice when you went in is the beautiful decorations of the area. Its area made us fill warm with joy and the vibrant colors really make you feel hungry. Next, the selection of food is very widespread. Prime rib and the crab legs are main eye-catchers, but other honorable mentions is the omelet station, salad bar, and desert station. There was also an area with different types of cheeses and dried meats if you're into that kind of food. Asian cuisine is also available, with steamed buns and few types of sushi.\n\nService was absolutely great. If you choose to, you can pay an additional $7 per person for unlimited bloody mary's, champagne, or mimosas. Otherwise, all other non-alcoholic drinks are included with the buffet price. Our server was able to keep all our drinks almost full at all times and made sure any extra plates are collected quickly.\n\nWorth it.

Disappointment.\n\nDesserts: Have had better elsewhere as well. Creme Brule was too liquid-y. Fancy-looking desserts in shot glasses were just mere pudding. They had a crepe maker person. I didnt try it but my husband did. It looked alright. \n\nThere were a lot of people there & we all felt so claustrophobic! Tables are small & only fit like 3 plates."

Yes, it is in a terrible location, but over years I've never had a problem in the parking lot. The interior ambiance is well-lit, classy and cheerful. The service is the reason I didn't give 5 stars.

S"[Note: review is solely for the lunch buffet]\n\nLotus of Siam has the best lunch buffet in Vegas, hands down.  Not because the buffet specials change daily (although tasty variety is nice); not because the ginger tofu dish is tart and spicy in a way that you know they are using fresh ginger; not because the fried sweet potato curry puffs have made me ditch my diet more than once (although, I could honestly pig out on a plate full of those things--crunchy and sweet with a dash of spice . . . mmmmmmm).\n\nNo, it's because each dish under the heat lamp is fresh.  In contrast to most of the buffets in Vegas, Lotus of Siam does not leave their buffet dishes under heat lamps for hours.  Each dish is fresh.  Hell, there's not much chance for the dishes to sit for long since the place is always packed for lunch and the kitchen needs to keep cranking out food to refill the buffet options.  \n\nOh, and the buffet dishes are properly cooked.  An overcooked chicken can ruin a Pad Thai, but you won't find that here.  It's tender, it's seasoned and it's wonderful.\n\nAnd they do a good job of catering to the full spectrum of spice lovers.  The dishes on the buffet aren't overly spicy, but there's plenty of hot sauce and dried hot pepper to stir in if you want to raise the heat level.\n\nAll around thumbs up."

S"Best Thai food I've had, and I live in L.A.  Unlikely city, unlikely location, a nondescript strip mall on a run-down stretch of Sahara Ave., but oh the food!\n\nI've been here several times now (try to make a couple of visits every time I'm in Vegas, sometimes twice in a day, it's so good).  Great beef salad, excellent curries, grilled chicken, wonderful homemade ice cream.  We've tried a lot of different dishes and everything we've had was great.  Ask for recommendations from the waiter also: that 's how we tried the catfish and the Nam Kao Tod, crispy rice with pork sausage.  They also have a great selection of Northern Thai dishes that you rarely find in other places.  \n\nOnce, we tried to order the mango with sticky rice but they warned us beforehand that the mangos weren't fully ripe and gave us a sampling of the mango to test whether we really wanted it.  It tasted OK, perhaps a little less sweet than a ripe mango in-season.  We decided to go with some of their home-made coconut ice cream instead.  I think this anecdote really shows the detail and care they put into their food.  \n\nThey have a lunch buffet on the weekends (geared more toward the locals or the typical tourist) which I wouldn't recommend, but you can still special order dishes during that time.  They apparently have a world-class wine list as well, but I haven't tried it; with the heat of Thai food, I always find myself craving a beer.  \n\nDespite all the fancy, big-name restaurants in the city, the meals I have here are always the most memorable."

S"I was forced to check this place out during my recent trip. My friend had seen it on some travel show and also had an article highlighting it from a magazine. It was said to be the best Thai restaurant on the west coast. Well after I heard that I had to see if this was true.\n\nWe called to make reservations however they don't take reservations. We took a taxi from our hotel and let me warn you that this is off the beaten path. When we arrive it was about 8PM and I honestly thought we were in the wrong spot. It's located in an old strip mall. \n\nUpon entering we found that the restaurant was packed, that's always a good sign. We sat down and proceeded to order a bottle of wine, Rudi Pichler Riesling. It went very nice with the spicy red curry. I am not a big meat person and would rather not touch the stuff. I do make exceptions and this visit was one of them. My friends and I usually opt for family style dining when we go out. It's no surprise that meat is ordered but I tend to leave them alone. \n\nWe had the Tum Yum soup (I remember this because yum= yummy) which had a little kick but was excellent. Next came the entr\xc3\xa9es, forgive me because I don't have the names. Red curry sauce with duck, and Pad Thai. Remember what I said earlier about meat? Honestly the duck dish was prepared and presented beautifully. I had to take a nibble. The meat was tender but the outside was breaded lightly. Great texture. The red curry was perfect because it wasn't overwhelming and went very nice with the duck. Pad Thai was the best because the noodles were not mushy as some places tend to over cook, and the flavor came alive in my mouth! (I need to go back, my mouth is watering just writing this.)\n\nAfter dinner we finished with some Tozai snow maiden sake and some banana dessert. Both were an amazing finish to a perfect meal."

I started out with some Satay, which was juicy and well seasoned and even included a delicious sweet cucumber salad. My entree was a pork stew, which wasn't hot, yet still filled to the brink with spices. I would absolutely recommend getting the sticky rice with it. I also had a couple of spoons of Tom Yum Koong soup, and it was delicious but way too hot for me, probably the hottest one I have ever had, felt like a wildfire was building up in my mouth. If you like hot food though, you should give it a try. I was too full to get dessert, however I had some nice green tea that was done exactly right, so I left Lotus of Siam smiling happily and am planning to return next time I am in the area."

S'Despite the reviews cautioning against dreadful crowds and long waits, we had no trouble getting seated immediately at 7 pm on a Friday night. This is probably the most spacious Thai restaurant I\'ve ever been to - in addition to accommodating multiple large party banquets at the time of our dinner, the restaurant was also serving patrons seated at the full bar (a traditional Thai restaurant with a full bar - classic Vegas; complete anomaly). \n\nDespite the strong fight put up by the drunken noodles and the tom yum noodle soup, I ultimately went for the pork larb ($8.95) with a side of sticky rice ($2) per my waiter\'s recommendation on the basis of both popularity and healthiness. According to him, the larb - consisting of "lean" ground pork mixed with red and green onions and cilantro bathed in a spicy/fishy chili lime dressing, accompanied by a few cucumber slices and a petite wedge of raw cabbage - is prepared with no fat and is one of the most popular menu items. While the dish was undeniably tasty, I found it to be wildly underwhelming on the whole - the flavors tasted exactly identical to the seasoning packets used in Mama brand ramen (which I love but don\'t need to pay restaurant prices for). The biggest disappointment of all was the dismally poor quality of the pork. Contrary to my waiter\'s word, the meat was EXTREMELY fatty, and I found myself picking out the visible chunks of fat as I ate. I definitely should\'ve gone for the shrimp instead, but we were in a hurry and didn\'t have time to wait for a new dish to come out. The sticky rice was a more moderate disappointment - the rice used is a longer grain than what I encountered in Thailand, so it was more fluffy than sticky. Save yourself $1 and just order the regular steamed rice. \n\nEven though I wasn\'t impressed with what was a solid 2 star meal, I attribute that more to mis-ordering than bad establishment. Service was fantastic, and you can tell the chef takes great pride in the restaurant and cooking/her food in general. I\'m not sure along which basis people can claim this is the best Thai food in America, but I\'d be interested in returning if I ever get the chance to try the more specialty / creative menu items, such as the drunken noodles and various seafood offerings - I\'d just recommend staying away from the pork.'

S'Read so many great reviews on yelp we decided to visit while visiting from Los Angeles. We were party of 3, two Asians and one Caucasian. We had reservations for dinner and were seated promptly.   We love Southeast Asian food and have been to lots of Thai, Laotian, Burmese restaurants in California and Asia.  There were about 100 other diners in the restaurant when we arrived. There were many things that ended up being unique about this restaurant, unfortunately the quality of the food was not one of them. First, about 99% of clientele was Caucasian. This is never a good sign at an Asian restaurant. Everyone had a bottle of wine at their table. That\'s another oddity at an Asian restaurant.  Despite these two warning signs, we still felt we would be in for a great experience, based on yelp reviews.  We really weren\'t looking for ambiance, wine or decor. We were looking for "the best Thai food in the US, as promised in these reviews.  We ordered the Northern Thai soup, which was ok but not balanced and way too heavy on fish sauce.  We had Nam Prik Onn, chili dip, which is a peasant dish popular in Northern Thailand and Burma. It usually  contains a bit of meat or fish in a very salty sauce into which vegetables are dipped.  It\'s eaten because meat and protein are rare and expensive in parts of thailand and Burma.  It gives a bit of taste to cheap veggie meals.  Here it was 10 bucks for a few tablespoons of something that tasted like middle america spaghetti sauce, a few vegetables to dip, and a handful of packaged chicharones (pork rinds) straight from the chips section of the local supermarket. We had Laotian style papaya salad, which was good. We also had crispy duck in chili mint sauce, deep fried fish in chili sauce, northern thai sausage.   We also had a combination dessert with coconut ice cream, sticky rice, mango, and banana wrapped in wonton wraps and deep fried.  Overall food was acceptable. Nothing was great. We had to add another dish at the end because we were still hungry at the end, portions were so small. No drinks except water. Bill came to $120 for 3 people. Add the $35 round trip cab fare from strip.  Absolutely ridiculous for mediocre Thai food. We went to a fantastic Laos / Northeastern Thai restaurant in East Oakland California a month ago and had almost the same things, with much better quality and larger portions for $39!  Of course there wasn\'t the huge wine selection, but who goes to a Thai restaurant for wine. That would be like going to a French restaurant for rice.\nBig disappointment and way over-priced.'

S"Having the unique perspective of being raised in Thailand coupled with 15 years in the food business, one could say I am qualified as an authority on Thai food, however, really,  the true authority on anything to do with food and drink is the taste buds of the person eating. And most folks who eat here love it. Having said that, I just don't get Lotus of Siam. Sure, it's good; the curries are balanced and the salads, and noodle dishes are tasty, but I feel that this is a place that is more concerned with it's reputation as the premier Thai restaurant in the area than the menu. They have tailored their dishes for farang, (foreign), meaning our milder,  palates. What is with the wine obsession? I have never experienced a Thai restaurant anywhere that directs such focus on wine. Not that it's a bad thing, I personally enjoy a glass of Pinot Grigio with a Glass Noodle Salad, for example, but it comes off to me as a little snobbish. The staff are courteous, but seem harried and too busy. The service is good, but I like to chat in Thai to my server and or hostess, and they just don't seem to have the time. Those who are seeking authentic Thai food should try some of the other Thai restaurants in town. Each one is different and I don't really have a favorite, although the beef salad at Pin Kaow is excellent, the curries at Komol Kitchen are mind blowing, (the pastes are made from scratch), and the Larb at Ocha is the best I've ever had anywhere! Order it with sticky rice. There are a few Thai places in Vegas I've not tried, mostly because of their location relative to my home, but for my money, eating Thai means enjoying the personality of the restaurant, the proprietor, & the food. In these areas, Lotus of Siam is little better than average, and the lunch buffet is the only thing I eat there if I'm on my lunch break and am in need of a quick Thai fix. I can get in and out of there in a half hour, and make it back to work on time."

Several of the people in our party were very concerned while looking at the menu because so many of the dishes are listed with chicken, beef, or seafood, but like so many Thai restaurants, almost anything on the menu can be made vegetarian.\nMy friend and I shared the spicy beef salad, the roast duck curry, and the northern larb.

With that being said, all is forgiven for these delicious eats.\n\n It\'s quite a daunting task for most restaurant establishments to place the correct order, number one, let alone place it and not forget to bring it all to the table at the same time.\n\nMy take on food quality is this. Quite tasty. Being oh so unoriginal, I ordered the Pad Thai and vegetable fried rice. I know, I know.. for someone so creative there is a lot to be said about my creativity while dining..but I digress.\n\nThe Pad Thai was exceptionally delicious, not dry, noodles cooked to perfection. Dislike: the server did fail to ask me at what heat level I would like my dish therefore I was left with absolutely NO spice what so ever. I may be unoriginal in dining dish decision making, but I do like to spice things up..with spices.\n\nIn closing, Lotus of Siam\'s exceptional customer service, attention to detail (& ability to overcome clarical errors), and hell attention to our large party in general would have us coming back for more.'

S"My husband and I thought this place was great. We came with no reservations, and the hostess took our phone number so we could either go to the bar or leave during the 45 min wait. \n\nThe waiter was probably what really made this place special. He had a great grasp on the extensive wine list (I ordered a bottle, and he confirmed that I knew what it was I was ordering...I did, but nice that he checked) and gave great recommendations so we could share dishes and have everything still pair nicely with the Riesling. I had the Panang Curry (at an 8, which was perfect) with noodles and my husband had the crispy duck with chili mint leaves. The noodles made for a messy meal, because the curry splashed around as I ate the noodles. The crispy duck was something I've been craving ever since.\n\nThe food came quickly, and our waiter was always nearby if we needed anything. He also came and brought a bucket of ice for our wine - something unexpected at a Thai restaurant. When I ordered the mango with sweet sticky rice (a staple at most Thai places), I was pleased when he advised against it due to the mangoes not being fully ripe.\n\nWill definitely be eating here again."

S'Must try the Nam Koa Tod (#14). by far the best thing we had there, and better than the "Best Thing I Ever Ate" pork dip dish. It\'s crunchy, spicy, sweet, and every bite gives you a different flavor profile. All the food looked great, but duck with drunken noodles was a 10 as well. Hidden gem and a great reason to get off the Strip.'

S'I absolutely adore spicy food, and Thai food obviously can fit the bill.  I do not live in Las Vegas, nor do I visit very often, but I do know good Thai food when I see it, and this is pretty solid.  What makes it 5 stars vs 4?  The wine list!  Amazing selection of German wine for very reasonable prices.  A perfect companion which cuts through the rich and intense flavors of many of the dishes here.  The menu is huge and I cannot claim to be an authority as an infrequent tourist, but the Nam Kao Tod is a fabulous appetizer.  Any variation of the Pad Kee Mao (particularly with crab) ordered spicy is amazing, but the my favorite dish here is the duck panang.  They fry strips of duck breast (breaded)  until crispy and then drizzle with a rich and distinctive panang which is far spicier than many editions I have had elsewhere.  Combine with a Donnhoff riesling and coconut ice cream to finish, and you have a fabulous treat of a meal...  Do not miss when in Vegas if you like Thai food.'

The shrimp are always fresh, good size and perfectly cooked.

I\'ve been here a number of times; probably every other trip to Vegas for me.  \n\nIt\'s not actually that far off the strip, but it\'s in this really terribly run down strip mall that feels really sketch.  It\'s hard to see from the front, and you\'ll think "am I really in the right place"????  Well, you are.  And you really did want to go here.\n\nThe food is frankly fantastic.  Every single thing I\'ve had there is some of the best Thai food I\'ve had, and I\'ve been there with several people who have spent time in Thailand, and they said it was some of they best they\'ve had as well.  \n\nMake sure to not skip out on the Northern Thai / Burmese food that\'s on the menu as well.  \n\nLast time I was here, we were in a rush to get to the airport, told the waiter, and the food was on the table in 15 minutes flat; it was amazing how good the service and speed was.  \n\nOh, and did I mention it\'s cheap?'

S"I came here on a Friday night at 9:30pm with a party of five!  The menu is immense but we did some research before hand so knew what we would be ordering ahead of time.  We had reservations and were seated right away!\n\nTom kah Kai - (3.5 stars)  broth was amazing!  The lime accent was perfect and the coconut was not too overwhelming.  The chicken however did taste old.  If the chicken was more fresh and tender this dish would be a five!  Maybe it was an end of the night issue.. chicken sitting for to long in the back in the pot.\nSea bass drunken noodles - (4.5 stars) the Seanad was super tender and the light breaking was perfect.  The drunken noodles were delicious and the combination was supreme. \nCrispy duck in panang curry- (5 stars!) It had a nice crispy exterior and the meat was tender but not at all fatty. The panang curry sauce was a great compliment to the duck. We finished off the sauce by putting it on everything we could find at the table! \nGarlic prawns - (4 stars) my first prawn was very good with a very nice garlic sauce.  However my second shrimp was very fishy.  So much so that I could not get the taste out of my mouth.  Everyone else that had one said theirs were great so not sure what happened with that one:-(\nNam prik ong - (3 stars) we were super excited to try this as we saw it featured as one of Ming Tsai'd favorites. While it was tasty, the after taste really reminded us of ground beef. Also it comes with a number of veggies for dipping which wasn't as tasty as the pork rinds that also came with the dish. \nKhao soi braised Short rib - (4.5 stars) meat was tender but the real star was the sauce and noodles.  Yummy!\nThai iced tea - (4 stars) very good typical thai ice tea\nFried banana - (3 stars)  ok, not great.  Would not order this again.\nMango and sticky rice - (4 stars) we asked for two orders and they brought them out on one plate.  The mango was delicious but not enough sticky rice\n\nWe were a party of five and they added gratuities on our bill which I found off.\n\nService was ok but not great.  Bus boy was  much more attentive then our waitress.\n\nWe will definitively return!  Our bill ended up being around $40 pp including beers and tip!"

S'Food is Northern Thai style and you can get things that you normally would not be able to get in other Thai restaurants. If you want Pad Thai, they have it but I would get something more adventurous. Tried the curry noodles, papaya salad, pork Hunglae curry, northern style sausage, and crispy rice salad. MY least favorite dish was the crispy rice salad but overall the food was very good, and just as good as the places I eat at in NYC. They have a ridiculous wine list, so if you are in the mood for wine, take a look at the list.'

S'Best Thai restaurant ever - don\'t worry these guys really do live up to all of the hype.  Why else would semi-inebriated foodies from around the country quietly ask their cab drivers to drive down E Sahara blvd for dinner.  "The Sahara hotel miss?" - no cabbie, I said the creepy dilapidated shopping center on Sahara Blvd next to the discount wig shop.  \n\nOnce you enter LOS the restaurant itself is much nicer than the location would suggest, and the waitstaff could not be nicer or more attentive.  Best bets include the crispy rice with sour sausage appetizer.  It is literally a party in your mouth - so many different textures and tastes.  There are a bunch of fresh herbs, deliciously crispy rice, cubes of sour sausage, cucumbers, peanuts, chillies, and red onion.  I only wish they would serve it in a giant cereal bowl with a big wooden spoon.  I also love their chicken wings with garlic and pepper.  They are so crispy and addictive, a perfect starter.  For main courses I love all their noodles and curry.  Friends have raved about the scallops as well.  However my favorite dish came on my last visit and was the drunken noodles with giant prawns.  The noodles were wide and spicy atop of lettuce and had a huge portion of perfectly fried shrimp on top.  The dish was amazing if no a bit pricey at $20 - but the portion was very large and included 8 prawns.  \n\nFinally the perfect ending is the mango, sticky rice and coconut ice cream for dessert.  I do not exaggerate when I say this is my favorite dessert of all time.  I have never had better mangoes than those I have at LOS.  Legend says that the chef rejects 75% of the mangoes they receive because they do not meet his standards.  They are the most perfect and sweet mangoes you will ever have.  Best of all, the fine staff at LOS will call a cab for you as you are finishing dessert so that your transportation is waiting for you at the end of your meal.  Truly a wonderful experience, and well worth the cab ride off the Vegas strip.'

You really can't see the restaurant from the street, but once you turn into a plaza and notice a huge empty parking lot, you are definitely getting warmer. \n\nI went with a lot of choices as advised by yelpers- the prawns with drunken noodles, the crispy duck in panang curry (it's been weeks since I've been but the name has stuck with me) and the last was a beef dish that I don't quite remember the name. The prawns were gigantic and cooked with such a nice crunch to them. The noodles that comes with it is a perfect accompaniment, even with your white rice! I also loved loved loved the duck. Great crunch on the skin and the curry had a reasonable kick to it- loaded with flavor. Both of these dishes I would no doubt get again. The beef dish- while the beef was cooked nicely was not a favorite of mine. It was doused in something that resembled BBQ sauce that I wasn't a huge fan of (and notice how I said doused, they probably put too much on the meat).\n\nAll in all, it was a delicious meal. It is on the pricier side for lunch but, I personally think it is worth every penny. Don't be shy and ask for more rice if you need something to soak up all that curry. Truly a 5 star for me!"

S'Lotus of Siam is a bit off the strip, and sits in a sketchy area. There is nothing special about this place, inside and out. After reading so much about it, and hearing Andrew Zimmern rave about this place, it was on top of my list for my last Vegas trip. It goes to show, all of the top restaurants aren\'t inside the popular casinos and resorts. Most of them are all commercialized and owned by restaurant groups. Lotus of Siam is one of one. It makes it unique and special, and is a part of Vegas as much as any of the popular resorts.\n\nWe started things off with something exciting and new. The Koong char num plar, raw prawns marinated in seasoned fish sauce was a favorite of ours. With the spicy fish sauce, fresh garlic and roasted chili paste, the dish definitely had flavor. Ironically, I used a bunch of that fish sauce to get rid of the rawness and "fishy" flavor. Spiciness met sweetness from the shrimp. The texture of this was spectacular. A bit on the sticky side, the texture took some getting used to. Still a great way to start.\n\nMy personal favorite was the Nam Kao Tod. It was a crispy rice mixed with minced sour sausage, green onion, fresh chili, ginger, peanuts, and lime juice. Texturally different from the raw shrimp, this had a nice crunch, and the crunch played a great role in this dish. The ginger flavor popped and the citrus was key. It was delicious and refreshing.\n\nThe dish of all dishes-the one to get here always Is the Drunken Noodle Prawn. Thick rice noodles are on fried with deep fried prawns. The shell I kept on and the frying process makes the skins edible. The special blend of garlic sauce and Thai basil was perfect. The prawns were cooked perfectly and the crunch of the skin was amazing. This dish is pretty hard to pass up -- a definite must order here.\n\nTo end everything, we ordered the coconut ice cream with sticky rice. It was a great neutralizer form all that garlic, shrimp, and spices. The coconut flavor was mild and not too overpowering. My favorite was the sticky rice. Everything just had such a delicate flavor and nothing was overbearing.\n\nBack home in Los Angeles, there are a bunch of Ktown style Chinese restaurants that have pretty good food. From spicy seafood noodles to fried pork and beef dishes, they are all delicious, but you won\'t find any of these in China. The menu hasn\'t changed ever since the first time I went, and that is the quality of the places. You know what you will get, and its the same no matter when you go. Lotus of Siam is kind of like that. The menu hasn\'t changed in forever, and the food, though may not be genuine Thai renditions is delicious.'

S'Do not let the dilapidated, East side Vegas shopping center deter you from walking into Lotus of Siam.  Behind the nondescript entrance intoxicating aromas entice you with an overabundance of simple yet exquisite Thai cuisine dishes.  The impressive, reasonably priced wine selection would put a Cheshire grin on the portly mug of Bacchus himself.\n\nJonathan Gold - food writer/ LA Times, said Lotus of Siam "is the best Thai restaurant  in North America".  I concur wholeheartedly.  Chef/Owner, Saipin Chutima implements the finest quality ingredients and melds flavors reminiscent of my experience of true Thai cuisine.  Chef Chutima opened Renu Nakorn in Norwalk, California although has since sold to family members.    \n\nMy dining group and I were punctual for our dinner reservation (dinner reservations are highly recommended) and were promptly seated in full view of the acclaimed wine cellar collection. \n\nAfter perusing the vast menu and conferring with our waiter we methodically choose  dishes from various regions in Thailand.  We found the Northern region to be the most interesting.  Even with a filled to capacity restaurant our server delivered our food in a timely manner.  \n\nA main staple in Asian cuisine, garlic prawns are deep fried in the shell and served with a pungent sweet-salty garlic sauce. The Soft Shell Crab salad combines fresh chiles, lime and peanuts.  The small crab, with a light and crispy outer shell was tender and moist inside - a crustacean lover\'s delight .  A popular Northern dish is the Nam Prik Noom - gently roasted sweet green chilies, fresh garlic and tomatoes are pounded to a flavorful pulp in a mortar and served with pieces of crackly pig skins and sticky rice.  We requested Chef kick up the Scoville units for some serious classic Thai chili heat.  The result, HOT and delicious.\n\nAfter enjoying two bottles of crispy white wine and traditional Sticky Rice with Mango for dessert it was time for my satiated dining group to depart Lotus of Siam.  As I waited for our taxi to arrive I visualized future trips to the neglected shopping center where star Chef Saipin Chutima passionately awaits those who savor traditional Thai cuisine.'

S"Amazing food!!! If you're in vegas this is a must. Best thai food in the Western Hemisphere! Be sure to make reservations in advance!!! If you like spicy #35 spicy shrimp salad is SPICY!!! Loved the catfish cakes, and they had a real yummy coconut chicken soup. The roasted duck curry is amazing. I ordered my meal from the back northern menu. Letter G a pork style stew. Don't be afraid of the congealed pork blood. This was amazing. Wish I lived closer. If I'm back in vegas I'll be back to eat at this joint! This is not a place to be missed!"

I will now be ruined for any future Thai restaurants - that's how good this place is.   \n\nThe restaurant is a hole in the wall, no ambiance but the servers are friendly and attentive... Here's what we ordered:\n\nTom Yum with Prawns (med spice) - the spice level was perfect, continued to build after each bite (or slurp).\n\nTod Muh Plar - fish cakes with cucumber salad, I would actually order the cucmber salad alone (its fabulous).\n\nKang Omon - catfish in a curry sauce, not as liquidy as a normal curry but delicious\n\nNorthern Thai - Khao Soi - noodles and beef (great - I had never tried N Thai food before)\n\nFried banana with honey and coconut ice cream for dessert - I could eat it everyday!\n\nThe food was great, the best Thai I have ever eaten, servers were friendly...

I've recently become a really big fan of thai food, although I've been a HUGE fan of pad thai for quite some years now.\n\nAfter seeing that the Lotus of Siam was on the food network, I knew I had to give it a try. I've been there about 4 or 5 times now and have been satisfied every time.  I mean, it wasn't THE best thai I've had, but I can see why everyone's raving about it.  Next time, try to be a little brave and order a little something from each category and try it out...you won't be sorry.\n\nI started talking to the waitress and she said that the reason why the food was so fresh is that they make a trip to LA TWICE a week to get fresh ingredients for their dishes. TWICE A WEEK! If that's not passion, I don't know what is."

S"I took a group of 12 friends there based on the recommendation of a friend.... It was some of the blandest Thai food I have ever had. \n\nThe Panag Nua was tough and lacking in flavor. It was a true Panag curry but it just seemed watered down. The meat had been just sliced and tossed in. Normally good Thai places have nice chunks of beef that they let stew in it all day so the sauce permeates it and the meat just falls apart. \n\nThe Yum Yai salad had almost no sauce and what litte sauce it did have lacked in any flavor.\n\nThe Tom Ka Guy soup was watery and heavily lacking in taste. The chicken in it was dry and huge chunks that were just not right for a soup. It also lacked a decent amount of mushrooms.\n\nThe Kow Pat Moo was totally flavorless for a Thai fried rice. It was more like over priced panda express Chinese fast food rice.  This is a huge failure. I mean how hard is it to toss nam plaud and sugar into some rice? \n\nThe Phad Thai was soggy and had more the consistency of spagetti with marinara then a thai fried noodle dish. \n\nThe saving grace was the moo sautee. It was nice and small like you would get on the streets of bangkok. It did taste good but then again that's the staple of Thai places and you would have to go out of your way to screw this one up.\n\nAll this being said my friends liked it BUT none of them have ever tried Thai food before much less GOOD Thai food. I think this must be the case for a lot of the positive reviews here. An other negative reviewer pointed out that there simply no Thai people in there this does tend to be a good indicator as to if a Thai place is good."

S"Their most recent exposure on Top Chef: Masters had an out-of-town friend wanting to check this place out.  After our first visit  many years ago, I figured it would be a nice treat to go back.\n\nAfter making reservations for a Thursday evening, they told us they would only hold the reservation for 5 minutes because they are that busy.  Okay.\n\nWe were a party of six - four adults and two kids.  \n\n* Chicken Dumplings ($6.95) -   Basic deep fried wontons with chicken and vegetables and served with a sweet chili sauce.  This order was mostly to satisfy the kiddies.\n\n* Our friend recently had a Crispy Catfish Pieces Salad ($13.95) at another Thai place and wanted to try their version.  When he saw the presentation, he was immediately disappointed.  The pieces were a bit larger than he would have hoped and it was just an okay salad taste-wise.\n\n* The Husband was certain about one dish in particular - the Crispy Duck Curry.  (He loved it before and that's all he could remember.)  When the waiter heard this, he insisted we order the Crispy Panang Curry instead and assured us we would LOVE it.  (It also cost $20.95.)  I asked him if he was certain we really would and he said yes.  We thought it was just alright...and not really worth the $21 cost of it especially.  Sure, it was tasty but I've had better panang curry in Vegas for a fraction of the price.\n\n* We also opted for something from the Chef Specials - the Red Snapper.  Sure, it was a whole snapper at market price, which ended up being $35.  Our friend couldn't believe it when he discovered how much they charged for it.\n\nWhen the waiter initially took our order, he asked what our spice level choice was.  We wanted the salad and curry mild since the kids would be eating it.  However, it was far from mild and we were unable to serve it to the children.  As we neared the conclusion of our meal, we wanted to add another dish.  We asked the waiter for some suggestion and he mostly focused on things from the Chef Specials that were market price or didn't appeal to us.  We ultimately decided we were done with the meal.  \n\nI did take a quick peek at the dessert menu hoping for a saving grace but there was nothing exciting on there and our visiting friends were done with their Lotus experience at this point.\n\nOverall, it was a disappointing visit.  Sure, they have all the fame they could ever want but it just leaves us wanting more. Maybe we ordered all the wrong dishes?  We probably won't be coming back here anytime soon."

Really good quality duck cooked perfectly, with a wonderful basil sauce that accented the dish without overwhelming the flavor of the duck!!!\n\nCrying Tiger.... I do have to say that though the flavors were good, the steak was over cooked! It was medium well almost well done.... we didn't finish the steak or take it home..... this one was disappointing!\n\nDrunken Noodles with chicken.... good... not great... flavors were good, but I ordered spicy 5 thinking this is my first time here and 5 would be spicy but safe.... no... not spicy at all... and for me, I need some spice with my thai noodles!\n\nAll around though, it was very good!

The Thai fried rice was average but everything else was delicious. The drunken noodles had sea bass which was crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside with sweet and spicy noodles. Perfect balance of sweet and spicy along with crunchy and soft. The Curry was very creamy with chicken and bamboo, I usually don't like bamboo but this was amazing. My only complaint was that four dishes cost $80....Delicious food but fairly expensive. The serving sizes are also not very generous...."

They are closed from 2:30p-5:29p, and reopen for dinner at 5:30p-10:00p (I learned this the hard way because I was actually craving their food today and went at 2:45 only to find out they were closed... wahh! My excitedness got the best of me because I didn't even bother checking their hours. WOMP WOMP WOMPPP!)\n\nWHAT: Prior to coming here for the first time (Yesterday, December 9th), I have always passed by, heard from other people, and have actually seen them on TV! Thankfully one of my best friends has been wanting to come here, so we made it a Date!\n\nWe came for dinner (I heard they have a buffet for lunch *wink wink*), and waited about 15 minutes to get seated. The restaurant was pretty huge for what I thought it would be, and it was definitely ON AND POPPIN' because every single table was taken.\n\nWhen we were seated, our server helped us to a glass of water right away, and constantly checked if we were doing okay. My friend and I finally got to ordering:\n\nWe both got cups of soup, which I love, because not a lot of thai places offer cups of soup! =D (Or at least the ones that I have gone to). My favorite soup ever is Tom Kah Kai (because of the coconut milk added). My friend got a tamarind base soup, which was remarkably soothing on a cold winter night.\n\nFor our main dishes, we both got curries. I tried the Musaman curry with veggies and tofu, which was extremely tasteful, my friend got the Green curry with a kick of spice- really good as well!\n\nThere were so many other things I wanted to try on their menu, but I think my eyeballs were playing tricks on me because I for sure wouldn't have finished it all!\n\nSo... GO, GO, GO! I'll probably be back in a few days because I want to try their CRISPY DUCK. MUAHAHA!\n\nGOOD LUCK, GET THE CRISPY DUCK! =)"

S'"Pick your spiciness level on a scale of one to ten for any dish you desire." Hell, yes!\n\nWe would have walked the ~1.5-mile distance from Circus Circus, but it was unseasonably wet (and cold) outside. We gave up and took a taxi, which set us back by about $15 round trip, including tip. Our taxi driver asserted that the shopping center that the Lotus of Siam is situated in is the first shopping center in Vegas. I haven\'t fact-checked him, but it did seem like it\'d been around for quite some time, especially the funky parking and overall traffic layout.\n\nJon A. and I picked out three dishes (with the help of our server), and I opted to try the Thai lime drink. The dishes included a bowl of Tom Yum Plar Dook (hot and sour soup with catfish, lime juice, lemongrass and straw mushrooms), roasted duck curry, and beef Khao Soi (Northern Thai egg noodles in curry sauce and coconut cream with your choice of beef or chicken, served with a side of with sliced red onions, lime, and pickled vegetables). Including Jon\'s soft drink, we ended up $45 lighter, including tax and tip.\n\nEverything was delectable, but we suspected that they may have mixed up our spice-level orders. Jon\'s spiciness tolerance level is much higher than mine, so we ordered the communal soup and my roasted duck curry as a six, and the Khao Soi was to be a ten. However, after profusely sweating through the catfish soup and hoping I\'d be able to handle my curry, we realized that the soup was probably the ten and the entrees both ended up sixes. Oh, well: everything was delicious, and I\'d go back and order that soup at a ten again. The heat from both temperature and spiciness really hit the spot! And the Thai lime drink? Well, it was a little too sweet for my tastes, but it was nice to cool off with while working on that soup.\n\nDon\'t expect much from the atmosphere, but that hardly matters. The crowds spoke by filling up the place by 7:30 PM on a Thursday evening. (Luckily we arrived before the swarms did. And the swarms had a wait of 45 minutes when we were leaving.) The service is pretty good for an Asian restaurant, but don\'t expect utter perfection.\n\nThe verdict: Excellent Thai restaurant! It ranks up there on my favorites. Not sure when I\'ll be back in Vegas, but if I do find myself on the Strip, then I\'ll be sure to stop in at the Lotus again.'

They even said our orders would be placed first and indeed it was; we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering and the bill was brought during the end of our meal which was excellent since we had a show to see.\n\nThe food was excellent, i had duck curry at spice level for 1/10 which is mild to medium spice for an average person. last time I was here i got 5 which is basically insanely hot so I recommend going low if you haven't been here before.

So, make reservation.\n\nWe ordered the special crispy duck with panang curry sauce, Thai fried rice, chilli mint catfish, ground pork, chicken curry, and stuffed chicken wings.\n\nThe crispy duck is really really delicious! It is a must try! We did pay $20+ for 6/7 small slices of duck meat tho. \n\nThe spicy chilli catfish was just ok.  It cost us $15 for literally 5/6 small pieces of fish.  The chilli mint ground pork tasted good but the serving portion was so small that we were almost upset.  Seriously, ground pork costs nothing.  Fried rice was good but nothing special.\n\nWe did have the sticky rice and mango dessert.  It is to die for.\n\nOverall, food is decent but prices are not acceptable for Thai food.  I would suggest you go for the Chef's specials such as the crispy duck and beef stew.  They are all over $20 a dish but at least they are special.  Don't order the typical Thai food that you can get it somewhere else at a much cheaper price.\n\nWe probably won't go back because all we really did was loading up on steam rice so we didn't have to leave hungry."

That being said, the food was really authentic, the shrimp were fresh and huge, and the service was warm!\n\n1. Thai Iced Coffee - Oh My Heaven, I would\'ve chugged this all day if I could have!\n\n2. Garlic Prawns - yum! I\'m don\'t always love fried shrimp, but these are perfectly golden fried (not greasy), are tender, and have a subtle seasoning\n\n3. Chu Chee Shrimp - Oh my goodness NOM! This was similar to a Red Curry but was super fresh and light tasting. \n\n4. Kao Soi - I\'m not in to soupy noodles, but my friend ordered this. His mom was raised in Thailand and he has had the dish at home and in Thailand many times. He thoroughly enjoyed it!\n\n5. Thai Iced Tea - this was fine, though I would\'ve preferred a stronger tea flavor (it was a little bland due to too much milk)\n\n6. Mango Sticky Rice - I suppose it\'s hard for this dish to ever really blow anyone away. It was good, and the seasoning on the sticky rice was a nice contrast to the sweet mango\n\nTip: make a reservation for dinner to avoid a 2+ hour wait. You should be fine for lunch though (we have no wait at 1:45pm on a Friday).'

I tried the food and it was good, but I have tasted better Thai food at few other smaller restaurants in Los Angeles. In my opinion, the reason that this restaurant has received so many awards is because this restaurant by far serves the most extensive menu. I don't rink there is any food left in Thailand that is not served at this restaurant. \nStill, I expect this restaurant to serve a better Thai ice tea than serving a ready made one bought in the market. \nI relatively eat spicy food in other restaurants, but I can't handle any Thai food with spice level rated more than 3, while they serve food up to spice level of 9. The spice numbering system is very tricky and the servers need to warn the novice customers when they order the spice level of the food higher than three."

S"So after dinner I had a huge discussion with my friend Angela who lives here in Vegas about this place.  I mean, this place has gotten crazy reviews from everyone about being the best Thai place not only in Vegas but also North America.  And I walked out of this place thinking it was good, but definitely not amazing.  And I went on a Friday night.  We were thinking that maybe I didn't get their best chef-but who doesn't use their best chef on a Friday night?\n\nWell, I went with 4 other friends and we ordered a lot of different types of food.  We started with Tom Kah Kai which is a traditional coconut chicken soup almost every Thai restaurant makes.  It's ok.  Not great.  I've definitely had better.  I was a little surprised.  And I got myself a Thai tea.  Same thing, wasn't great.  Have definitely had much better.\n\nWe then got a spicy salad.  I don't remember which one.  This I liked more but only because it was really, really spicy.  Spicy and salads is a rare mix and it worked out with this salad.  But most my friends couldn't handle the spice.  I could barely handle it myself to be honest.  \n\nWe got a pad thai noodle dish, a pineapple fried rice and a fried sea bass dish.  Maybe, we got some more things though honestly I don't remember the rest.  Really tells you something when I can't quite remember what we ordered.  It's simply because the food wasn't that remarkable.  The sea bass was crazy disappointing.  I though we were getting an entire sea bass and only got a small cut of it.  I almost flipped the table over when they served the sea bass especially as it was the most expensive dish we got. $30 for this one plate.  Crazy, absolutely do not order this.  Completely overpriced.  You go to any other authentic Asian restaurant you're getting a whole fish for that kind of price.  Actually, you're getting a whole fish for less than that price.\n\nSo overall I was not impressed with this place.  Did I get the wrong chef?  I don't know.  I doubt different chefs are going to give you different portions of the fish-this is for sure.  So I thought the food was good and I wouldn't tell people to avoid this place.  But at the same time I don't think I'd come back here unless I was going with someone who'd eaten here multiple times and knew exactly which dishes to order and which ones not to."

I love this place.  I also have an infatuation with their fried prawns.  I always come as soon as they open.  That way I can be seated immediately.  I always leave room for dessert.  Can\'t go wrong with coconut ice cream, unless you hate coconut.'

S"Lotus of  Siam is great American-style Thai cuisine. Unfortunately, the previous reviews on yelp don't really say this, or maybe I didn't read enough of them. Either way, now begins the review.\nLotus has hands-down the best Orange Chicken I have ever had. If this was 15 years ago, I would've given this place 5 stars. But just like I am no longer a chubby teenager, my taste for fried, overly-sweet, food has passed. The chow mein and pad thai were both good, but their respective sauces were too rich. Or something. Just not 4 stars on yelp good.\nMyself and my eating partner both got the buffet at lunch for $9.99, so discussing the portions is dumb. Let's move along. The service was fast (for a buffet) and water was brought to the table promptly. The used buffet plates disappeared in less than a minute when pushed to the edge of the table.\nLotus is great if you prefer less-than-traditional Thai food."

S'5 stars for food, 3 for service... average 4. \n\nService... not so good. It took them 20 min to take our order (it wasn\'t we weren\'t ready they just never came by). However, the waiters were serving this big table next to us. As someone who used to wait tables I know it is easy to neglect other tables when you have one massive party to attend to. \n\nI\'m def. willing to give it another chance though as my friend said she never has bad service there. \n\nThe food was excellent. Most Thai places I\'ve been too felt "cheap"... this was the only Thai place I\'ve been to that felt "expensive" if that makes any sense... like the got high quality ingredients and didn\'t skimp on the spices. They get an A++ for having a dish with assorted seafood that *GASP* wasn\'t overcooked or previously frozen for an extended period of time (i.e. rubbery seafood). We had the drunken noodles with assorted seafood as that\'s what yelpers appear to be having. We also had that peanut sauce beef (beef rama) and fish cakes. All were good. The fish cakes were interesting... little better than normal but had a lot of chilis... probably the most underwhelming of all the dishes... This place has so much though that if I\'m in Vegas again I\'ll try some more!\n\nFunny though that only some things are marked spicy while some are not (i.e. fish cake and drunken noodles). People who can\'t eat too spicy food be warned... I can handle pretty spicy food and the DN were surprising (though good). I\'m sure my friends who don\'t eat as spicy food were dying (or as she said, crying, lol) inside. I wonder how spicy the dishes marked spicy are then!'

We went Sunday night at 5:30 right when they opened for dinner. The place was half full when we sat down. By the time we left, the lines were out the door and it was a zoo. Make a reservation."

S"@FoodieBear and @katfishkh did me a solid by recommending this place after seeing me check-in on @Yelp at another Thai place (Archi's, decent in their own right).\n\nI have driven past this sorry looking, God-forsaken strip mall a few times over my many trips to Las Vegas and never once thought about stopping in.  As you drive by on Sahara it looks like sketch all the way.  Major sketch.  With graffiti on top.  From the back.  You see the back of the strip mall.  Not sketch from the back, that's gross.\n\nWhen you turn in it's not much better - people of Vegas, would you please patronize these poor businesses up in here?!\n\nBut once you enter Lotus of Siam you feel like a sprightly lotus blossom yourself.\n\nWell, you feel like you're on to something good.

S"Wow, it's been awhile since we visited this restaurant.  But, we hadn't forgotten about it.  We always thinks about the Garlic Prawns (Chef's Choice).  Since this was an impromptu trip we didn't have a set plan for anything special, except to have Garlic Prawns.\n\nWhen we reached our hotel we immediately called the restaurant only to find out they are completely booked this evening and tomorrow evening as well. They said it could be up to an hour or more wait.  We decided to chance it since we wanted our guests to try the Prawns. My husband went into the restaurant and place our names on the waiting list.  we decided to cruise the strip thinking we had at least 45 minutes, well, within 20-25 min we got a call saying they are ready for us.  I was thankful we didn't drive further into the strip , we may have lost our spot if we didn't return on time!\n\nTo not make this any longer, we got our prawns and we were pleased just like the first time.  Our guests enjoyed it just as much.  We enjoyed the Peking duck curry, yellow curry, nam sod, and fried banana and coconut ice cream for dessert.  Everything was excellent, including the customer service.  \n\nOh, how I long to return already!"

S'Heard a lot of great things about this place and finally decided to check it out. It\'s located in an odd spot in one of Vegas\'s older strip malls... if you\'re dining here at night you\'re in for an adventure, there\'s definitely a lot of unique neighbors. I came here on a Thursday night at 8:45pm with two of my friends. They were pretty busy but not packed and we were able to get seated immediately.\n\nIt was an interesting place; in the middle of the restaurant they had a huge wine selection concealed behind a glass wall. Additionally like a lot of popular asian restaurants there always seems to be more Americans than asian patrons. \n\nAnyways... after we were seated our server Jim, (I don\'t think that was his real name), was a phenomenal guy. He must have been working there for a while because he knew everything and anything about the menu! Jim made some great recommendations from the menu and always checked back to see if we were doing fine. \n\nWe ended up ordering quite a bit of food, but my favorites were #14. Nam Kao Tod, which was rice flavored with lemon, it was very savory and #13B Moo Dad Dew, which was the best beef jerky I\'ve ever had.\n\nOverall it wasn\'t a bad experience. I would rate this place 3/5 but we ended up finding hair in the drunken rice and that was an immediate red flag. Especially the way the server had handled the issue. Our other server, (not Jim), wasn\'t even sure how to go about it. His first response was to bring us a new plate; we pretty much had to send back the entire dish until they removed it from our check.\n\nWe ended up spending $44 for 3 people. (That was after the drunken rice was taken off of our bill).\n\nLotus of Siam is definitely your typical mom & pop shop, there were handwritten "out of order signs" on paper place mats near the restrooms and you could clearly see the cleaning supplies in the restroom. Also the seating in the restaurant is a bit crowded, there\'s tables randomly scattered everywhere. You can literally place your arm on someone else\'s table if your not careful!\n\nTips: This place is a bit overhyped, the food isn\'t bad but it\'s like any other traditional Thai restaurant just with more reviews.'

S'After reading yelp reviews, I decided this place was a must-visit. I went there on a weeknight at 8:30pm, thinking I was late enough to be able to get in without waiting, but found out I had to wait FORTY FIVE MINUTES! That is how popular this place is. I ended up leaving and making a reservation for dinner 2 days later. If you want to eat here at dinner without a wait, you MUST call in advance!\n\nOur waiter was extremely helpful in explaining the menu items, since nobody in my group was familiar with thai food. He was very patient and gave us helpful suggestions, and our water was always promptly filled. Thank goodness for that, because the food was HOT.\n\nMy group likes spicy food, so we asked for our dishes to be prepared to a 5, 7, and 8 on the 1-10 spiciness scale. IT. WAS. INTENSE. Hence my drinking 3 glasses of water, and thank goodness my waiter was prompt in refilling my water because I might\'ve died otherwise. If you ask for a number higher than 5, know what you\'re getting into: A 10 would be practically nuclear. \n\nI can\'t recommend the fried catfish enough. It\'s one of their specialties, and for good reason. We ordered fried catfish with basil. The catfish pieces were so tender and flavorful, they tasted like a much more expensive fish. Any of the curries is also delicious. One dish I do not recommend is any of the dips. For $10, all you get is a plate of blanched vegetables (which are pretty fresh, to their credit) and a cold "dip" which is often more like a salad. But the other items we had more than made up for this miss. \n\nI always imagine dives like lotus of siam to have giant portions, but the servings here are small, rendering the restaurant more expensive than the menu prices would suggest. It\'s enough, but you probably won\'t have leftovers. \n\nAll in all, this place truly impressed me. I\'ve never had thai food better than this!'

Curry is my faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaav. *drool*\n\nThey pretty recently renovated and doubled the size of the place, which I was very happy to see because when I first started going, there was usually a 45 min wait for dinner.\n\nI suggest you high-tail it there asap.'

S'Simple: \nNOT WORTH THE WAIT \n\nDetailed: \nThis place has all the tidings of PF Changs or Beni-Hana; it is a pseudo-Asian restaurant, clad in intrigue for us white people with its not-steak-and-potatoes dishes, but which in reality has zero comparison to truly authentic Thai flavors. Really, no comparison at all. Walking in (after waiting for hours, yes, hours) and witnessing an entire wall of wine selections was all I needed to sense the intended audience for this restaurant. Tasting the dishes just reinforced that opinion....descriptions like uninspired, bland, devoid of passion, and check-minus come to mind. Thus it seems all the hype stems from a captive audience (ie vacuum of Thai restaurants) in Las Vegas and, judging from the amalgamation of stickers in their window, what appears to be some sort of metacritic savant and/or interwebs wizardry.\n\nExecutive Summary: \nAre you somebody who considers a trip to Panda Express an exotic and adventurous night out?

S'Lotus of Siam is a tad bit overrated. During my experiences, I had to admit I was a bit disappointed at the service and the food. The server managed to mess of a couple of orders at our table and the food was just okay. I did go in having high expectations since I had heard from others that this is the "best thai food in all of vegas." Well at the end of the day, I could see how that opinion was formulated, as there are not that many great asian restaurants in Las Vegas...period. Vegas is more of an Italian, French and Sushi type of city. \n\nI have tried garlic chicken wings, which are supposedly "sauteed with a lot of garlic, black pepper, and seasoning." UM these were just plain old dry chicken wings. There were some flakes of salt, pepper and garlic on the side which wouldn\'t even stick to the wings. I tried one bite and was finished...dry and flavorless.\n\nI also tried the drunken noodles which were just okay. Maybe 3 of our 5 stars at best. Some of my friends ordered some dishes off the Northern menu, which were actually decent. \n\nOverall, this is an average Thai restaurant and I would not return!'

The banana blossom one was, are there words? No. I don't think there are. There wasn't a bad one in the bunch. Some were requested hot. And we got Thai hot. Which is blow  the top of your head off good.\n\nWe moved on to several soups which were amazing as well. I especially liked the shrimp with bok choy? I think it was bok choy.

Located in a dumpy strip mall off of Sahara Boulevard, it serve astonishingly good Thai food; in fact, the chef won the James Beard award last year! Best of all is an award winning wine list where many of the wines are priced below retail. We put our group in the waiter's hands, and he delivered eight or ten terrific appetizers and shared entrees, each better than the last. I took the opportunity to pillage the wine list, and although some of my selections couldn't be found, we ended up with some stunners.

There was a curry dish or two that I have never tried before but I think I missed out not ordering off of the menu.  \n\nIf the popularity of this place is doubted, just show up at 11:20 to see the people waiting out front for it to open.  It's located in a weird strip mall location.  You can't tell from the road that it is actually more of a business complex than a strip mall.

S"3.5 stars\n\nLotus of Siam has probably become one of the most famous Thai restaurants in the country, if not the most. Not too long ago, it was one of those hidden finds off the touristy Las Vegas Strip. Thanks to rave reviews from people across the country, as well as attention from the James Beard Foundation, the restaurant is squarely on everyone's radar.\n\nGARLIC BLACK PEPPER CHICKEN WINGS - These were very crunchy and probably a bit overcooked. Surprisingly, I also found them rather bland. I'm curious if perhaps we received the wrong order, as there wasn't really any noticeable black pepper.\n\nSTUFFED CHICKEN WINGS - These wings were better, stuffed with some pork. Really meaty with a nice, light crunch to them. These weren't as moist as I thought they could've been though.\n\nTOM KAH KAI (Bangkok Style) - I'm actually not at all familiar with this soup, but it was popular on Yelp. It didn't look like the most appetizing thing, but it was pretty good. There was a little bit of heat here, balanced by some lime juice and the coconut milk. Kind of reminiscent of a Chinese hot & sour soup. Kind of.\n\nCOMBINATION BEEF NOODLE SOUP - My mother was craving some soup noodles, however this was a little too spicy for her. It had a lingering spice that seemed to compound.  The broth had a lot of beefy depth, and I really liked the noodles here. Comforting.\n\nSEA BASS DRUNKEN NOODLES - Wonderful dish. The sea bass was excellent. Lightly fried, the fish was moist and flavorful with just a little bit of crispiness. The noodles were very good as well, with some heat from the chili and a nice herbal sweetness from the basil.\n\nI don't know a whole lot about Thai food so it's hard for me to really draw comparisons. I found this to be a pretty good meal, with the drunken noodles and sea bass to be a big highlight."

S'The most overrated Thai restaurant in the country welcomes back Dan P.!  I was encouraged by the likes of Ryan D. and new acquaintances at Khoury\'s to give the "best" Thai restaurant in Vegas another chance.  So I made my third visit.  Today, Lotus redeemed a star.  However, I am sorry to say that its still overrated and I doubt I will return for a fourth visit.  We had the roast duck curry, the green curry with beef, and the pad see ew.\n\nMy favorite was the roast duck curry.  This is the dish that has inspired other restaurants like Thai BBQ and Stick E Rice to make the Americanized red curry with cherry tomatoes, grapes, and pineapples.  I think they both do it better.  The curry was sweet, but had some flavor to back it up.  The portion was ridiculously small, and the duck meat, while good quality, was skimpy.  This is an above average, Americanized duck curry that I guess I would recommend if you aren\'t familiar with authentic Thai food.\n\nNext up was the pad see ew with pork.  The pork was a bit tough, but nothing to complain about.  What little Chinese broccoli there was in this dish, wasn\'t rotten this time, so that was a plus.  This is a very saucy pad see ew, and sweetened.  Good for the general public, I suppose.  Not a bad dish, but I prefer a drier pad see ew.  You can get a much better version of this next door at Komol with huge portions of fresh Chinese broccoli.\n\nAnd on to today\'s joke, the green curry.  This is one of the weaker green curries I have had. The beef was a little on the tough side.  There was potential with well balanced and interesting spices in the curry, but the curry itself lacked any real backbone or character.  It was quite watery in taste.  I had to add chili powder to make it enjoyable.  If you are a fan of green curry, you might want to skip this one.  Again, the portion was small.  \n\nAs with most Americanized Thai restaurants, don\'t be afraid to order really spicy to have a bit of heat.  I could eat a 10 here and not break a sweat.\n\nLoS gains a star for not having rotten Chinese broccoli, and taking that terrible Northern Red Curry off of their new menu.  Unfortunately, this place is still on the bottom of my list as far as Thai restaurants in Vegas go.'

They sold us on a buffet they closed 20 minutes prior but did not mention it. We paid for a half full buffet they had no intention of re-stocking and didn't care when we asked about why they didn't tell us. \n\nWe paid $30.00 to not eat here.\n\nSo disappointing!"

Food is the best, they are really consistent so you can come back anytime and the food would be the same, that what get the score. You don\'t want to come back a month later and the food taste differently, at Lotus of Siam, they give you the "wow" expression when the foods come out. When you see the waiters bring out the food to other people, it just makes you want to order the whole menu because how beautiful and tasty the foods are. I would give this restaurant 5/5 because the foods are amazing and extraordinary'

When hubby and I arrived, we were rather dismayed to find ourselves standing outside the rather shabby exterior, flanked by questionable businesses in a sketchy strip mall.  However, all reservations dissipated when spotting the many photos of celebs on the walls and smelling the yummy smells within.  The four of us chose the pad Thai (with chicken), snapper, drunken noodles with tofu, and the northern style sausage.  All were excellent: not drowning in sauce, no bad aftertaste, just flavourful food that made us overeat.  :)  Service was especially good: attentive, patient, yet unobtrusive.  Prices are mid-level (around $12-15/entree) and portions were generous, not ridiculously so.  We will definitely come again.'

S"Best thai food i've ever had.  The menu is hugeeee, over 100 different items. It took me at least 15 minutes to decide what I wanted to order because everything sounded so good.  There was sooo much stuff that I really wanted to try.  I ended up going w/ some spicy catfish over lettuce (forgot what it was called, but it was good).  We also had a spicy catfish soup and stuffed chicken wings.  The portions are pretty good sized, so it was a lot of food.  The 4 of us were stuffed.  After the appetizers before our entrees came, we decided to order their crab fried rice too (which my friend told me was awesome), they took our order for that and our entrees came out.. and we got full halfway through eating it.  We could barely eat anymore... luckily our waiter knew that and didn't put the order in yet, thank god.  \n\nThe food here is VERY spicy, watch out for how spicy you order things.  It's from 1-10, and the 7 is extremely hot, even though i eat spicy food all the time.  The soup we ordered was 7, and i was dying and sweating non stop.  I asked if they had milk to cool down the spicyness, and the waiter laughed at me :( (as did everyone else at the table).  then i asked if i could change my entree from a 7 to a 2, and he said no too late, and laughed again :(.  But i was soooo happy he was just kidding when he brought my entree out and they changed it.  I think the next time I go, i'd probably go with a 4.\n\nThe wait was kind of long though, about 45 minutes, but well worth it.  We tried to make reservations, but it was a Friday night and they said they didnt take them that night.  \n\nThe service was awesome... The waiter was really nice and friendly, made lots of recommendations, checked on us all the time even though they were extremely busy.\n\nPrice wasn't bad, they have lots of entrees between $10 - $20.  For the four of us, with drinks, entrees, appetizers, and soup, it was $140 total w/ tax.\n\nAlso not only is the menu huge, the wine list has a very large selection too.\n\nI'm definitely coming back here the next time I'm in Vegas."

You can have amazing really gourmet Thai fare, or you can go for authentic simple peasant dishes. Both amazing in their own right; simple and delicious or complex. I actually like their salads and curries. They'll put together anything you want if you don't see exactly what you want on the menu. They are very accommodating. I almost always order their seafood and it really just perfect. There is a newer section to the restaurant that I am not as fond of for seating. It pays to make a reservation and specify you want a quiet corner, if that is what you  are looking for. They will take good care of you.

The chicken was a little dry and the soup was missing the depth of flavor that has always put it over the top for me in the past.\nFor other starters, we had the Issan sausage that gets raves from other reviewers.  It was good, but not a new favorite.\nThe entrees were far better, with the Sea Bass on Drunken Noodles being my new favorite.  The fish was so perfectly cooked and buttery that I won't be able to return here without getting it every time.  We also had the Nua Nam Tok, which was one of their many charbroiled beef options.  They do a good job with their beef and it had a great flavor with lots of heat.\nI do wish after all these years, the restaurant would improve its website.  The site has changed a few times, but it always seems to be hit or miss when I visit.  Stop with all the fancy stuff and just give me the basics: menu, hours, reservations.  Thanks"

S"Hallelujah, I think I've finally been converted to a Lotus of Siam fan. I have been to Lotus of Siam on two previous occasions and have not been impressed. I'm the first to admit that I don't believe I ordered the right things on my previous visits, so I take ownership of that. \n\nI came here this evening with my fella. It was his first visit and he was excited to finally try the famous Lotus of Siam. He's a big fan of Komol, so he wasn't sure Lotus could top it. We arrived around 8:45 and there was an estimated 30 minute wait. We were seated in less than 20 minutes, thankfully. Once seated, our server was extremely attentive and friendly from start to finish. There wasn't a moment that our drinks went unfilled. He checked back on us often, so that helped give them an extra star as well. \n\nOn to the food. Having had two previous less than spectacular visits here, I was on a mission to find the right food to eat here. I had heard so many great things about the nam kao tod, so that was a must try. We also ordered the drunken noodle with prawns and the choo chee duck. The food came out quickly and the food portions were incredibly generous. The spice level was no joke. I had heard they were famous for spice, so we ordered a 5 to stay on the safe side. We typically order a 7 or 8 at other restaurants, but we were very glad that we erred on the side of caution. The flavors were amazing. The name kao tod had the perfect flavors and texture. The drunken noodle were also terrific. So was the choo chee. The duck was cooked perfectly and I loved the sauce. \n\nLotus definitely more than converted me to a devotee this evening. It'll definitely become a regular on the Thai rotation again, I'm excited to say. I already have a list of other delightful delectables I'm looking forward to trying on my next trip."

For some reason we were never able to go but this time around we definitely made it a priority -- from now on, I will be coming here EVERY trip.\n\nThis was hands-down the BEST thai I have eaten, anywhere. I am a huge fan of Thai food and while it is always really delicious, I have never eaten Thai at a restaurant where I was blown away by the flavor, ingredients and innovation in traditional dishes. I researched what I should order (there are magazine articles dedicated to what you should order when you visit!) and so our table of six ordered:  Som Thum, Crispy Rice with Sausage, Golden Tofu, Tom Kha Kai, Yellow Curry Beef, Garlic Prawn, Chicken Rama, Crispy Duck Panang Curry, and one of each of the desserts. We also doubled up (and tripled) on some of the dishes. Holy crap - everything I ate exploded in my mouth with flavor. The Crispy Rice, Golden Tofu, and Crispy Duck Panang Curry really stood out in my opinion. This falls into the top three best meals I have ever eaten in my life. No wonder this is a foodie destination.\n\nBeware:  we ordered level 7 spice on the Tom Kha Kai (Bangkok Style Soup) and Som Thum (Green Papaya Salad) and were practically blowing out fire. :-) Still really delicious though, but know your level of spice!"

It reminded me of authentic Chinese dishes, which has better flavor... probably because of the MSG), and crispy duck drunken noodles (again, this reminded me of authentic Chinese dishes which I like more). Despite me liking the Chinese versions more, these dishes were still pretty good. \n\nI also had pretty solid Thai Coffee and a very bold glass of Riesling wine. \n\nService was fantastic even though they were obviously running around because it was busy. \n\nIf you go here, you will have an enjoyable meal and friendly staff.

S"Just like many others, I longed to visit Lotus of Siam after seeing Anthony Bourdain to there on his show. It seemed fortuitous because I saw the show one month before a planned visit to Vegas. After going there with three other foodies, we all agree that it's a must-stop while visiting Vegas! We went there for lunch, and the large restaurant was full within 30 minutes of opening.\n\nWe decided to order some of the dishes we saw in the show that were from the Northern section of the menu. The Khao Soi with pork was delicious and had very tender pork with vegetables in a curry sauce with coconut milk and noodles. We also tried the Nam Prik Ong, which is a pork and tomato mixture served with fresh veggies and pork rinds for dipping. It was much better than I expected! The star of the show, however, was the Garlic Prawns! This absolutely delicious dish consists of large shrimp that are deep fried with the shell and topped with a fantastic garlic sauce. It sounds unusual, but the shell is supposed to be eaten, and the way that it's prepared makes it almost like a shrimp chip. We liked the Garlic Prawns so much that we ordered a second dish! \n\nIt's true that Lotus of Siam is located far from the Vegas Strip in a remote area, but it's worth traveling to! It can take a while for cabs to come pick you up when called, so I suggest waiting to snag a cab that's dropping off someone instead.

S"I got a dinner/show package for Gordon Ramsay Steak and Jersey Boys at a discounted locals' price.  Last night was the night and both were excellent!  I am one of those people who dislikes the public persona of Gordon Ramsay.  I'm not sure I would have come here last night but it was one of the food options and I grabbed for the ring and I got the gold one.\n\nI had a few choices from their menu for each course but it was easy for me to order.  For an appetizer, the British ale onion soup.  For the main course, I chose the 24 ounce bone in rib eye.  And for dessert I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  I did not order a side, an extra charge, since I would be eating approximately a pound of beef alone.  \n\nI had a reservation for 5 PM and arrived shortly before.  A hostess asked me to wait in the lounge area and assured me I'd be shown to my table soon and I was.  Another hostess asked me if I wanted to walk the stairs or take the elevator.  The stairs it was.  She seated me at a small table along the railing which gave me a nice view of the downstairs dining area and a  view of the ceiling with the Union Jack and the neon sculpture.  Coming up the stairs, she explained that the neon was an artist's conception of the movement Ramsay's hands make when he's creating a beef Wellington.  It is very interesting very different.\n\nRichard, one of my servers, brought me their drink iPad.  I politely passed and went with an iced tea.  They only serve bottled iced tea, Republic of Tea, and I was given a choice of three flavors.  The blackberry sage was my choice, a tea I often make at home.  \n\nI gave Richard my voucher for dinner and a few moments later, he brought the Ramsay menu and told me my choices for each of the courses.  I ordered the soup and steak first and waited until later to order dessert.\n\nSome bread was brought to my table and the selection was so different than normal.  There were two lemon thyme focaccia squares, one mushroom truffle mini brioche, a pancetta fig mini brioche, and two slices of Stilton walnut baguette.  On the side of the bread plate was a round of English Devonshire butter with Hawaiian volcanic sea salt sprinkled on top.  Yes!  A restaurant that doesn't hide the salt from you.  I did observe a woman at the next table trying to get some butter without getting a single salt crystal so I understand both sides.  The bread was excellent.  I had one slice of the baguette and one mini brioche--the mushroom truffle.  I knew there was a large steak coming and I wanted to leave room.\n\nThe onion soup was excellent.  I had some of that soup at Ramsay's Pub at Caesars so I knew what to expect.  Rich broth, tasty caramelized onions, and the two slices of Welsh rarebit on top made for a very good start.\n\nThen a runner brought my steak and it was indeed huge!  It had a Demi-glace with mustard seeds.  The steak was done extra rare as I requested.  It was marbled very nicely and it was very tender.  I sat their thinking I must be some kind of glutton as I kept eating and eating until I was almost completely to the bone.  At home, I would have gnawed on it like a dog, but I let my better manners take over last night.  After bringing me the steak, Carlos, my other server, asked if I wanted any salt or pepper.  He appeared a but later with a plate with two containers--one with ground pepper and the other with sea salt!  A second Yes!\n\nLater, I ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  I also had this at Caesars. I wanted to compare it to some STP I had the week before at another steakhouse on the Strip.  There is no comparison.  Ramsay's version wins hands down.  It's a moist pudding cake served with toffee in a metal pourer and a stick of brown butter ice cream.  Delicious!\n\nA note on service.  Richard and Carlos were first rate!  They were polite and friendly.  An above and beyond kind of thing happened when I asked Carlos about the types of bread.  He went to the kitchen, got a sheet of paper, and wrote out what they served.  That was really nice of him and it helped me remember the different things on the plate.  At the end of dinner, Richard gave me a business card with their two names on it and I'll keep it for the future because I will be back.  I have to try some more things on the menu.\n\nBy the way, Mr. Ramsay, I may change my thoughts about you a bit.  I understand that you're public persona is somewhat of a show for TV and that you're much different--read nicer--when not before the cameras in Hell's Kitchen!"

S"Whenever I show up to Vegas with the girlfriend and if we stay for at least two nights, I always try to go to an upscale steakhouse. This recent trip to Vegas a few weeks ago was no different.\n\nI'm not sure how other reviewers are saying that you can't make a reservation through OpenTable but I did and just to be sure called to confirm. Just to be triple-sure I showed up to Paris a day early to ask about the reservation and the hostess (though she didn't seem too friendly) confirmed it as well. So a big YES you can make reservations through OpenTable and it will be honored.\n\nWhen we showed up, we didn't wait long before being seated (we were about 10 minutes early). \n\nIf you are coming here for an intimate dinner, you might want to look elsewhere. The way the restaurant is set up (at least on the bottom floor) is done so that you are literally one-arm's-length from the table next to you; which to me is a little too close for comfort. \n\nLike Cut, they will show you examples of the various steaks available and the impressive marbling on each. We settled on a side of spinach, 1x bone-in ribeye and 1x beef wellington - both medium rare.\n\nThe food: the spinach was so-so for me, and the beef wellington, while excellent, all paled in comparison to the rib-eye, which was absolutely tender, delicious, and just about melted in your mouth.\n\nHaving been to several of these kinds of steakhouses over the years it really comes down to three things: Service, Ambiance, and Food. While Gordon Ramsey Steak does an excellent job with the Service and Food aspect, I wasn't terribly  impressed with the ambiance. While it's definitely nice inside, it's not really meant for a romantic setting between you and a significant other.\n\nHowever, with a ribeye this good this place definitely is worth another try sometime in the future."

S"Fourth visit. Initially, excellent food. Great sliders. Amazing steaks and salmon. Potato pur\xc3\xa9e that I would have previously called the best in world was overly watery. Sticky toffee pudding still one of best desserts on planet. Service slightly stilted. Had to get waiter's attention to let him know we had need finished eating for 10-15 minutes and request dessert menus. A forgotten drink. Coffee served after dessert finished. But still would have been solidly 5 stars. Got check. Wife immediately noticed check was wrong (regular prices instead of total rewards (Caesar's program) but check indicated Total Rewards discount applied at top. I assumed because discount indicated at top she was wrong. But as we left she pointed out prices on menu on marquee. I then had to walk back in on principle (550 bill vs. 530 bill). First, he argued with me (but I got definite sense he knew...waiter at a restaurant of that calibre is aware of menu pricing) then conceded. Then deferred to manager. Who then had me wait 13 minutes. I got tired of waiting. Approached manager and asked if we could speed it up (wife and kids outside waiting) and snapped my fingers in a 'can we speed it up motion.' Response was 'don't snap your fingers at me! We are working on it.'  No apology. Defrauded me out of 18 bucks, but I am the jerk. Get money. Left. Never an apology. \nReally spoiled expensive meal. You would think Ramsay wouldn't tolerate this. I will not. Plenty of places on strip I can drop 600 hundred plus on a meal. Oh well. Check your bill."

S'I really wanted to like Gordon Ramsey Steak.  I went in with high expectations, but left slightly disappointed.  I sat at the bar and ate, as I was traveling for work.  The bartenders were all quite nice, and pleasant.  My order was simple.  A glass of Shiraz, the house salad, and the Beef Wellington.\n\nThe Shiraz was fine.  A good pour by the bartender.  Nothing amazing, but it was good.\n\nThe bread was good.  It was a good start to the meal.  There was a mushroom bread, and olive bread, and one that I couldn\'t understand.  I actually asked the server to repeat what type of bread it was, but I still didn\'t get it.\n\nThe Salad was underwhelming.  It had way too much dressing on it, and the the flavors were mediocre.  The lettuce was a bit soggy.\n\nWhat I was expecting to be the star of the meal, The Beef Wellington, was just OK.  The beef was good, but the breading on it didn\'t do anything special for me.  I felt as though the potatoes and the veggies could have been a little bit more plentiful on the plate.  It was good.  Just not Amazing.\n\nAll in all, I would give the restaurant a 3.5 star rating.  However, one of my rules is that if nobody says "goodbye" when i leave, I take off .5 stars.  It is not a very difficult task, and should be a focus of all good restaurants.  In fact, when i left, there were 4 (yes FOUR) Hostesses standing out front.  Not one of them said "thank you" or "goodbye" to me.  It may be worth a try if you exhausted the other steak places in Vegas.  I may go back next time and try a regular steak instead.  However, for now, I\'ll say that Gordon Ramesy continues to disappoint me (Pub, Burger place, and now Steak).  Maybe i just need to lower my expectations....'

I have eaten at places that cost this much but does not taste nearly as good as this place.\n\nI don't remember if it's a weekday or a weekend we went but we had to wait about an hr for our table.

S"I scoped the Yelp reviews of this place before we went for my birthday and was surprised to find so many poor reviews. I completely disagree with them too, by the way. \n\nWe made reservations for 9 pm on a Monday and I didn't make the reservations, but my boyfriend said he had no problem getting them a couple days before. I was pleasantly surprised by the modern feel of the place with the club-esque atmosphere.\n\nThe staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Our server, Charles, started us with the drink menu which comes on an iPad, but despite what it seems, you can't actually order drinks from the iPad. We ordered a Vesper and the HK Antioxident [sic]. For appetizers, we ordered the foie gras and half dozen oysters. Before our appetizers came out we got bread and drinks. The panchetta bread was delicious and I could have eaten a whole loaf by myself. For our entree we ordered the wellington for two and we were informed it would take 45 minutes which was fine with us although I'm sure some people would have been less than satisfied with such a wait. Our waiter walked us through the cuts of meat that we had to choose from with the meat cart which is a little unorthodox, but if you don't know much about steak or you forget the difference between a porterhouse and a ribeye, it's good to know what you're getting.\n\nIt took longer than say, Chili's, but by the time we finished our appetizers plus 5 or 10 minutes, our wellington was out. We also had a side of creamed spinach which was very tasty. Charles had recommended one side to split and said we'd have the perfect amount of food and he was correct. I thought I would have no room for dessert, but I was wrong. Enter the sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream. This is a must have dessert. We split an order and it was the perfect sweet ending to a phenomenal dinner. \n\nEverything beginning to end was the caliber of food I would expect from a place with Ramsay's name on it. The waitstaff was knowledgeable and I would definitely go back here. However, if you're looking for a quick meal, this is not the place to go. It is a great experience though if you love and appreciate good food."

S"Ate there on Sept. 22.\n\nThis may be the best meal I have ever eaten. Period. The food, service and pacing was phenomenal. One downer--the music could have been toned down a bit. It's a steakhouse; the atmosphere should be a bit more refined. \n\nWe ordered the Wagyu beef (the real Japanese stuff). We were going to split ten ounces of that (damned expensive at $32/oz., but it's something I'll probably never eat again because it is so expensive but everyone should try it once) and a 21 oz. ribeye. Our server made a mistake and brought us only six ounces. Besides saving us a hundred and thirty bucks, it turned out that both that and the ribeye were quite enough. The ribeye was probably the best I've ever had and it PALED to the Wagyu.  \n\nOur server (Charles) made sure the meat was sliced and placed in the center of the table so we could help ourselves. We split an appetizer (the pork belly) and each had a side (truffle fingerling potatoes and creamed corn and each side is enough for two),  dessert (the sticky toffee pudding and it's to die for).\n\nAs I've alluded to, the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Yes, you're paying for it. But, share an appetizer? Split the steaks? No sweat. Except for the noisy atmosphere, I don't think I've left a restaurant more satisfied."

My sister's boyfriend even  bought some uncooked items (like the wellington) to take home to my sister and bake in CA since she couldn't be there. Her boyfriend is a server and when one server can't stop raving about another, you know he's got to be good at his job."

S'I\'m being a little critical of this restaurant because of the price and amount of other quality steakhouses on the strip. First things first your gonna need a reservation for sure! 2 weeks before there was still limited availability! Luckily we got in. I live the decor and atmosphere of the place. The bar area was nice and they had an extensive alcohol menu. First problem...the bathroom was flooded, gross. I had to leave the restaurant and walk a bit to get to the restroom.\n\nOnce seated we began the hard decision of choosing our food. We ended up ordering the fish chowder, beef tartar, Waygu rib cap, and beef Wellington. The soup was good, the fish in the soup was really tender and delicious. The tartar was good, but nothing special at all. The 8 oz waygu was really good, super tender and was the reason for the 3 stars! The beef Wellington was good...for beef Wellington! I\'m just not a fan of that dish. We also ordered their "famous" sticky toffee bread pudding. It was average.\n\nOverall with drinks and tip it was about 350$ and in my opinion not worth it. My steak was delicious but I think with all the other options on the strip I would not be returning. However if your a big fan of Gordon Ramsay and not concerned with price the atmosphere is top notch !'

S'Had I read Cameron\'s review on here before I made this reservation, I might have saved my money and spent it on a better experience.  Cameron\'s review is so completely spot-on to what we went through, it is sad.\n\nWe arrived about ten minutes ahead of our reservation and checked-in.  They asked if we wanted to be seated, so we thought, "why not" because we had a show in about two hours and figured better safe than sorry.  Apparently "being seated" means just that because literally no one came over for the next ten minutes - no menu, no water, just sitting there like assholes.  And, although the walk to the table was all of maybe 50 feet, we apparently looked like we might get lost or fall because not one, but two hookers, I mean hostesses, had to accompany us and give us the speech about the "journey" and the art installation.  I am all for having the ladies look nice, but v point hems directing you to their hoo ha and barely covering their rear is not classy.\n\nWe finally got the drink i-pad and saw you could "select" your choices on there - because you might "forget" between the huge gap in time between when you get it and when the waiter actually comes back to take the order.  And we also were not told that the still water was bottled and for a fee, not that we cared about the cost, but it is tacky not to inform the customer.\n\nThe bread selections are pretentious as well - lemony focaccia and the like.  All were super dry and I would have been happier with simple rolls or bread.\n\nThe biggest laugh was with the roll out of the meat cart.  For a man who criticizes every restaurant he "saves" on television for their "gimmicks", he sure has plenty of his own.  Believe me, if you are eating at a place like this and don\'t know your meat already, looking at it raw is not going to mean anything to you.\n\nWe ordered (half dozen oysters, lamb duet, haricot vert, carrots, bone marrow, pork belly, prime filet) and then I spilled my drink because the cocktail glasses are so large around that you cannot possibly get a good grip.  NO ONE CAME OVER!!  I guess you have to actually break the glass (like someone next to us) before someone will do something.  I cleaned up the spill with the husband\'s napkin, placing ice on my bread plate and that sat there until the final moments of the meal and we had to ask for another napkin.  We also had to continually ask for more bottles of water and to get the drink i-pad back to order something else.  Seriously?  Are you not out to make money?  Was our $300 meal not enough for you?  Did we do something to offen the ghost of Gordon (who apparently only comes in once every two months or so and was "busy" at MGM Grand that night - hopefully learning a thing or two about good service and food at Craftsteak)\n\nThe meal itself was split - husband said the green salsa on his marrow was bad, they should have just put sea salt on it.  He did like the filet.  My lamb was overcooked, tough and plain awful.  The shepherd\'s pie was also way too salty and other than that had no taste.  The oysters were the balndest things I have ever had, even with the "champagne mignette" or cocktail sauce added.  Carrots hd a curry added to them and the green beans were literally the best part of my meal - how sad.\n\nWhen we got the dessert menu, I almost laughed aloud.  The selections on there reminded me of things you expect out of a cheap chain with carrot cake and I am not kidding here - banoffee pie.  I told the husband not to waste more of his money on this poor excuse for a dessert selection and we attempted to get the check.  The server - who had been MIA for a LONG time at this point, was "SHOCKED" that we didn\'t order anything, not even coffee - which I know because he shared this with the assistant server literally two steps away from our table.  I was willing him to ask me about it so I could lay into him.\n\nWe also had the lovely experience of seeing the floor manager "radio" to the front about our table (I know we were 42 because it was on the check) saying "five minutes on 42" - when we were not even done with our drinks and had just paid the check two second before.  Gee, it was before 8 and we had a 6:15 reservation, I am sorry if we are taking up your space.\n\nDon\'t waste your time or money on this garbage.  I will never be able to watch his shows again and the husband, who was a true fan, was totally disappointed in what was supposed to be the highlight of our trip.'

S'I was in Las Vegas a few weeks ago with my business partner and was meeting an associate of ours for dinner. Being a big fan of all of Gordon Ramsay\'s TV shows I thought it would be an amazing idea to take them and their wives to Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris Hotel. Based on the standard of excellence I see on his TV shows, I expected much more. At first, the service was good. Food was explained. Each cut of steak was displayed and we all decided on our meals. I ordered French Onion soup as my appetizer and i ordered Pork Belly as my meal. Two of us ordered the Waygu Rib Cap and the other two ordered Fillet. We shared the following sides: Baked Potato, Brussel Sprouts, Beet Salad, Foie Gras. \n\nThe consensus was that the best thing we ate was the Loaded Baked Potato. The other sides were good as well. Steaks were OK, but overcooked.\n\nAfter we ordered we didn\'t get any service. Our waiter ignored us from that point forward. We were never asked how our food was. If so, we could have told them the meat was overcooked.\n\nOnce we were done we sat with empty plates in front of us for at least 15 minutes. I know it\'s fine dining and it isn\'t supposes to be "Fast," but we had bussers and waiters walk by us many times without even asking if we wanted our table cleared. We weren\'t wanting to leave, but we didn\'t want empty plates in front of us either.\n\nI don\'t think I would go back. I would simply head over to the Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian where the service has been exceptional.'

S'Three of us went to GR Steak for dinner (5/28 at table T34), based on the glowing recommendation from a friend who came last week. Thankfully we had reservations as the place was full.  We were not disappointed.  The fantastic evening started with the service. Our server, Charles,  explained the menu, showed us the steak trolly and introduced us to the Hell!s Kitchen tasting menu (HKTM). The one catch with the HKTM is everyone at the table must order it.  We decided to go with it based on Charles thorough description. I recommend the wine pairing with that. In addion we added a 3 ounce potion of  A5 Kobe Filet at a pricey $30/oz. It was worth it, beyond expectation. It was truely the best mest we ever had.   the stick toffee pudding was wonderful.   The whole experience was 5 star and worth the $700 rice tag.'

S'I was here in late October, 2012. A group of friends and I went for another friend\'s birthday and we wanted to try some place special. This place did not disappoint! There were 12 of us in our group and we waited too long to get a prime reservation time, so we settled for 5:30pm. I am not a fan of eating early, as it makes me feel like I\'m going to the early bird so I can get back in time for Matlock. However, with this being a special occasion, we took what we could get and learned from our procrastination. \n\nWe arrived promptly for our reservation and were immediately taken to our table. The table was huge and gorgeous. Our 12-person party had plenty of room and felt quite special with where they chose to sit us. Our server introduced herself and she was quite pleasant and knowledgeable. Keep in mind, we intended to do this up right, so we were settling in for a long night and informed our server of our plan. She was happy to spend the evening taking care of us and it showed in her playful attitude. \n\nBetween everyone in our group, we nearly ordered everything on the menu. I myself ordered two entrees because I wanted to try both the Halibut and the Rib Tip. As I like to say, I did it just for the halibut! I\'m sure no one has heard that before. \n\nI could go into everything that we ordered, but it doesn\'t matter; it was all delicious. Like I said, we ordered just about everything on the menu and we shared and passed around everything like it was a holiday meal. All-in-all we were there for three hours. There was no one trying to rush us out the door so they could turn the table (that is first on my "do not do" list for servers, followed by "act like you want to be here and you want me to be here"). \n\nThe food, the service, the ambiance and the whole experience was well worth it. Oh yeah, we got to meet the winner of Hell\'s Kitchen, Christina Wilson. She graciously allowed a few of our friends to take pictures with her. Of course, she was super busy, so they tried not to bother her too much.\n\nIf you have the time and are in Vegas for a special occasion I would say this is a must do. It is on the expensive side, but it is an experience you will never forget. Personally, I\'m a fan of expensive, well-worth-it meals. I can\'t think of a better way to spend time with friends.\n\nOne last thing...the cocktails!!!  So amazing. My favorite is The Drifter. This consists of a special batch of Knob Creek bourbon (delicious by itself) added to a little ginger liqueur, falernum (a sweet citrus mixer found mainly in Caribbean drinks) and a little lemon bitters. Oh man this is so good. It is served with a big ball of ice, only one. This helps to keep it chilled without watering it down.  I must say, I have spent the past holiday season trying to perfect it at home and I\'ve come very close. It is about 98% there and I\'ll take it. I did call the restaurant, but the were reluctant to help me out on the ratios. Luckily my five years experience of tending bar helped me get closer than acceptable, yet just out of reach of perfect.\n\nGo and have fun!'

S"Gordon Ramsay Steak has ruined all other restaurants for me. The restaurant was so sexy and classy at the same time. The hot waitresses wore tight black minidresses and the waiters were dressed well too. My date and I arrived for our reservation and we were seated very quickly. The waitress walked us to our table and on the way, told us how the light fixture on the ceiling was inspired by Ramsay's hand movements when preparing his signature dish. The waitress seated us and placed the napkins on our laps for us. Then our waiter came with the menus and explained some of the drinks and food. We ordered the Beef Carpaccio, Beef Wellington, Beef Short Rib, and Fingerling Potatoes on the side. As we waited for our food, our waiter came by with a cart of raw beef and showed us the different cuts they served.\n\nThe bread was really goo. There were three kinds of bread. My favorite was the mushroom-truffle. It came out warm and was incredibly soft. Even the butter topped with some kind of black-colored salt was amazing.\n\nThe Beef Carpaccio came on a plate with the beef resting on top of a halved bone with some small salad on top. It was to die for, but I was sad that the portion was so little.\n\nThe Beef Wellington was cooked perfectly. It was so tender and not dry at all! You could really taste the meat and the texture just made it more enjoying to eat.\n\nThe Beef Short Rib was braised with red wine and came off the bone with little effort. The meat was perfect and a little fatty. It was so good!\n\nThe Fingerling Potatoes were cute. The truffle really made this dish. I would probably try a different side unless you love potatoes. I'm not crazy about potatoes but this side was good.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the Sticky Toffee Pudding. I loved it so much! The butter ice cream was incredible and the toffee pudding was like heaven in my mouth. The Sticky Toffee Pudding was what I really waited months to come here for and it did not disappoint! It was big! I suggest sharing this unless you have a lot of room for dessert!\n\nThe service was absolutely perfect and the food was wonderful. Every time we got up to go to the restroom, one of the staff would come and refold our napkin. We were checked up on at the right times. Our water would be refilled quickly without asking. After every dish was brought out, all our plates and utensils were replaced with new ones. The waiter even cleaned away crumbs on the table as we waited for our next dish. I felt as though they were watching us eat because how could they know exactly when to come to our table and do these little things for us without us ever asking? It may sound creepy but they have spoiled me!"

S"Went here for our honeymoon. Loved the food. Excellent. Had the bone in ribeye, fantastic (but have had better). The thing that really took away from the experience was the atmosphere. Loud/party music, can't really carry on a conversation. Not ideal for a romantic meal."

S"Before I elaborate on the review (and whether you choose to continue reading), all you really have to know are these two very important points:\n1. Food is excellent. Like, seriously guaranteed to be one of the best meals of your life.\n2. Service has gone down, dramatically (And I say this, dramatically. Though, still true!).\n\nThe first trip was definitely worth the 5 stars. Top notch service: very attentive, energy levels were high(high enough to wake me from my hangover), both very important keys in taking a good dining experience to a memorable one. The second time, was an entirely different experience. I wanted to bring my boyfriend here because he's a HUUUGE fan of Gordon Ramsay and I've been raving about the best steak I'd ever had in my life being from this restaurant. When we got there, the hostess checked us into our reservation but there was still a 20 minute wait. The last time I was here, they offered us seats at the bar to wait at but it seems the bar itself has become its own attraction so it was packed and we had to kind of awkwardly stand around instead since there's no real waiting area. After we were taken to our seats, it went from awkward to uncomfortable. Our multiple waiters seemed miserable and our main waiter seemed genuinely annoyed that he was waiting on us. He didn't crack a smile ONCE. I think he even scoffed under his breath when we turned down dessert. However, the food definitely makes up for the attitude. I got the filet mignon both times, and they were excellent both times. It was just as good as I had it the first time around! Very juicy, and very flavorful. It was obviously a high quality cut of meat and in Gordon Ramsay fashion, kept it simple to accentuate the dish's natural flavor. Also, the foie gras is extremely rich and buttery. I almost melted into a pool of my own drool (we no longer have foie gras in California, you see.). Still dying to try his signature Beef Wellington! Will certainly have to save that for another trip. \n\nRegardless, my boyfriend lapped it up. He was too focused on the food to notice the rude waiters so he was very happy with his first Gordon Ramsay experience. We still had a good time so the night wasn't entirely ruined. Hopefully you won't get the sour faced waiter, either! \n\nP.S. It's $9 for each bottle of water! I mean it's delicious water, but we definitely wouldn't have gone through 3 bottles of it had we known."

S'Highly disappointed!!!\n\n I made a reservation for Valentine\'s Day 2015 on Oct. 24, 2014. I\'ve literally been planning my entire Valentine\'s Day weekend around this restaurant reservation - I\'m staying in Paris, I\'m seeing a show after this meal... you get the idea.\n\n Unfortunately my plans were shattered today when I received a call from Stacy  around 1:30PM asking me to confirm my reservation and note that they had a "special" Valentine\'s Day menu. Okay, no big deal, this isn\'t my first time dining out on Valentine\'s. I call back Stacey at the number she provided (not the main number) and it rings and rings. I call back 15 minutes later. Same thing. I try calling the main line which takes me to the Paris operator and ask to be transferred to GRS only to be told they are not currently open. Clearly somebody was working when I received the call, but now they have magically all disappeared in a matter of an hour or two!\n\n I call back this number several times over the course of the next few hours with nothing more than a ring-ring-ring-ring... ever heard of a voicemail or a pre-recorded message letting callers know when you\'ll be open... or if you\'re open? Hello, is this thing on? \n\nI finally get a hold of someone around 6PM tonight and confirm my reservation. I ask her about the "special" menu as I know I am  a very picky eater and the hostess tells me I can find it on the OpenTable website. So I get off the phone and hunt down this menu which is not easy to find and there\'s almost nothing on the menu I\'m going to even think about eating!! Honestly, my husband who will eat almost ANYTHING hardly even saw anything on there that HE would eat!! I called back to verify that nothing else would be served that night, and that\'s what I was told. I was planning on ordering appetizers, filet mignon, dessert, tons of champagne, etc. but now I can\'t get ANYTHING that I\'m even remotely interested in! I don\'t want a freakin\' quail egg! I want to order off your REGULAR menu that I based my reservation off of TWO MONTHS AGO!!!!!!!\n\n I do not understand the concept of a "special" menu on Valentine\'s Day! I assume this is to make it easier on the kitchen and wait staff (along with making it more expensive by taking off the cheaper menu items) but instead it ends up making it a pain for the consumer.  I am so very frustrated and disappointed. I wanted nothing more than to have a fancy French dinner at an upscale restaurant on Valentine\'s Day at Gordon Ramsay Steak, and instead I had to cancel the reservation I made over two months ago and now I\'m left scrambling to find another place to meet our needs on Valentine\'s! How romantic indeed!\n\n Screw you, Gordon Ramsay, I\'ll go waste my money on overpriced food elsewhere!'

S'Steaks are awesome, but kinda expensive for the serving size. Las Vegas Strip pricing in effect, for sure. Weird red lighting everywhere. Like the uncomfortable red-lit scenes from the 1981 Disney bomb "The Devil and Max Devlin" starring Elliott Gould and Bill Cosby. Surprised that Gordon Ramsay approved of the lighting in here. They say that the color red makes you hungry...\n\nCap Of Ribeye ($60) a.k.a. Spinalis steak, is my favorite cut, even more so than Hanger Steak. Both are extremely hard to find, and special orders even at the best independent butcher shops. So maybe it\'s worth the splurge after all?\n\nThe English Chowder ($18) is pretty terrible. Don\'t even think of ordering it. Exactly one tiny scallop, one minuscule bit of fish, and 3 halves of a fingerling potato. Boring white chowder with a unnecessarily snazzy presentation - they pour the soup in front of you.\n\nBottom line: Gordon Ramsay Steak will do just fine, regardless of the lighting (or the crappy Chowder).'

S'Service: Extremely attentive. Almost too much so, but they really took care of us. When we first arrived, the hostess asked if we would like to take the stairs or elevator (I think it\'s common practice, but we noticed that none of the waiters were taking the elevator, so maybe they aren\'t allowed), we went through two big bottles of water because they were constantly refiling our glasses, and our waitress seemed overjoyed when we handed her a cash tip. \n\nFood: Perfect fish, perfect meat, perfect pastry, perfect perfect perfect perfect. My boyfriend said it was the best meal of his life. The portions are "fancy restaurant small" for some dishes... don\'t be fooled. We were SO full.\n\nPrice: Expensive, but expected. My boyfriend and I got waters, ordered one appetizer (Hamachi Crudo), two entrees (Beef Wellington and Seafood/Fisherman sampler), a side (truffle mac and cheese), and desert (blueberry tart). Ran us $206 after tip. \n\nOverview: I recommend everything that we ate. Cooked perfectly, well balanced, and there are some "food snob" items along with some very basic but tasty items on the menu. The atmosphere is kind of pretentious (the hostess explained concept behind the huge, neon, chandelier/piece of art in the center of the dining room, etc.), but I chalk that up to the location, and Gordon Ramsay\'s idea of what a Vegas restaurant should look like. The food speaks for itself, and that\'s why I was there.'

S'All I could think of is the following abbreviation ... FFF (Fury for Flavor).\n\nSpecial note on decoration: The red neon sculpture on the ceiling represents Chef Ramsay\'s hand movements as he prepares the Beef Wellington.\n\nSpecial note on tasting menu: There was the Hell\'s Kitchen Limited Edition Tasting Menu (Scotch Egg, Potato and Octopus Salad, Scallop Risotto, Beef Wellington, Sticky Toffee Pudding - $145 per person + additional $75 for wine pairings). If you are looking for Chef Ramsay\'s scallop, you will have to order the tasting menu because scallop is not on the regular menu.\n\nOnce we were seated, our waiter immediately gave us the iPad with wine and cocktail menus. A moment later, meat / steak cart suddenly appeared as our waiter explained different cuts of meat.\n\nThe overall service was exceptional with one minor hiccup. One of waiter was about to serve Kurobuta pork belly, but later he realized that blue crab soup was supposedly come out first because that was technically what I\'ve requested. Not like I cared about which dish came 1st, but the waiter took the pork belly back to the kitchen and we basically had to wait another 15+ minutes for the soup to come out. \n\nBreads - Free Refills (Lemon Focaccia w/ Olive Oil, Black Truffle Mushroom w/ Pancetta + Pork Fat, Baguette w/ Blue Cheese, Butter w/ Volcanic Sea Salt) - Black truffle mushroom bread was amazing, baguette was decent, and lemon focaccia was average. Sea salt butter was one of the smoothest butter I\'ve had.\n\nBlue Crab Soup (blue crab, corn, red curry - $17 Total Rewards Member, $18 Regular Price) - Creamy texture with a bit of sweetness, sourness, and spiciness all in one bowl. Full of flavors and a pretty good soup. \n\nKurobuta Pork Belly (cheesy grits, tomato jam, onion pork jus - $18 Total Rewards Member, $19 Regular Price) - Pretty good pork belly (some portion of meat was melt-in-your-mouth good), but all that tomato jam and onion pork just didn\'t enhance the overall flavor of pork belly.\n\nFingerling Potatoes (parmesan, truffle - $11 Total Rewards Member, $12 Regular Price): It has this very interesting roasted flavor - did not regret this order.\n\nRoasted Beef Wellington (medium rare w/ 45 minutes wait, glazed root vegetables, potato pur\xc3\xa9e, red wine demi-glace - $99 for 2 Total Rewards Member, $101 for 2 Regular Price) - This should be the best order right? Well ... not at THAT price level. Well seasoned beef with flaky golden crust - so I could see the appeal, but I still prefer the traditional juicy cut steak. \n\nSticky Toffee Pudding (sweet pudding cake, brown sugar toffee, brown butter ice cream - $13 Total Rewards Member, $14 Regular Price) - Ho, ho ho! Definitely best order of the day. Such an amazing dessert ... and brown butter ice cream was the BOMB! One of the hardest ice cream to cut with a spoon, so I just stabbed it with my fork and took one bite at a time. Simply the right sweetness and texture for pudding cake - man, so amazing. \n\nOver-hyped prices, pretty good appetizers and the Beef Wellington, and out-of-this-world sticky toffee pudding. Probably not worth $300 meal (for 2 or 3) because I am pretty sure you can get better food with that kind of money, but it is still not a bad choice for the special occasion (or your are simply a Gordon Ramsay\'s fan and say "I\'ve visited his restaurant ... at least once in my lifetime!").'

S'The Las Vegas skyline is populated with mega-structures designed to dazzle the eye.  The Paris Resort is no exception.  To enter, you drive under a fifty foot Arc de Triomphe.  The valets are dressed in stereotypical Parisian stripes, and you must cross under the humongous foot of La Tour Eiffel inside the casino to get to Gordon Ramsay Steak.\n\nIn keeping with the subtle details of Las Vegas design, you must pass through the Chunnel designed to transport guests from Paris to the United Kingdom.  This metaphorical journey is subtle but the massive fifty foot Union Jack on the ceiling is anything but.  There can be no doubt that you have arrived at Ramsay\'s place.  The hustle and bustle of smoothly functioning kitchen and wait staff permeates the room while guests seems quietly in awe of the house built by America\'s hottest TV chef.\n\nThe booths in the upstairs balcony provide a sense of privacy, but the myriad of servers quickly keep you from feeling neglected.  A server\'s assistant places an interactive iPad on the table and teaches us how to navigate through the digital menu.  There is also, some interesting background data on Chef Gordon.  Our waiter, Yaron, was explaining the menu and its multitude of options, when he drops the ultimate bomb on our table; "we also have an exclusive chef\'s tasting menu for a limited time".  Done, we are now treated to five courses of culinary bliss complete with wine pairings and dessert.\n\nThere were moments when you could see Chef Gordon\'s classical training, there were moments when you could see the quasi-arrogant TV personality showing off and there were times when you felt like the Scot from Stratford England was just a bloke looking to feed his mates from down the pub.\n\nChef\'s mastery of the preparation of beets with pumpernickel soil was a lesson in culinary flavor and texture teamwork.  The world famous Wellington beef was prepared to perfection; of course.  However, when we read that fish and chips were next on our pairing meal we couldn\'t quite wrap our minds around it.  I made the snide comment "it better come with a pint" while quietly trying to figure out what wine would accompany fish and chips.  When the aesthetically appealing plates hit the table the sommelier was right around the corner with glasses and a bottle of Fin du Monde Ale.  Chef Ramsay was dazzling our minds and our mouths while remaining true to his roots.  \n\nThis chef\'s menu was not cheap, coming in at $170 per person (with wine pairings).  However, if having a culinary experience with a mastermind as your guide isn\'t enough to give you the celebrity experience, you also get an autographed photo of the TV star himself.\n\nThe experience is one that you should not miss out on during your trip to Vegas.  As for locals like myself, we now have a new restaurant to call home for every visitor that comes to Vegas.'

S'I decided that I\'d take myself out to one upscale restaurant during my stay in Las Vegas, and after some careful research landed on Gordon Ramsay Steak. I think I made a great decision.\n\nThe restaurant itself was full, so I was sat in the bar, where they serve the full menu. As a solo diner, I think this was actually a better place to be: the atmosphere was lively and friendly. My server was attentive and helpful.\n\nI started with a Vesper, the classic James Bond Martini, which was well-balanced and one of the better-mixed cocktails I\'ve ever had. A selection of breads followed, which were all delicious, even if some fell into the all-too-American trap of being too sweet. They were accompanied by "Devonshire butter", which made me chuckle, but it was undeniably a delicious way to begin. These were signals: I knew I was in for a treat.\n\nMy appetizer made me cry. Sounds pretentious, I know, but I actually shed a tear. It\'d been a very hard year, and this moment of luxury was a catalyst to begin letting go: a single raviolo, filled with ricotta and jamon, and an egg, such that when I cut into it the egg burst and mixed with the ingredients to make a fine sauce. Brown butter, watercress and edible flowers all added delicate notes to the flavor. It was more than the sum of its parts, and I couldn\'t begin to understand how it had been put together. A surprisingly emotional piece of pasta.\n\nThe steak was ... steak: a high quality piece of meat, perfectly cooked. I followed the advice of reviews I\'d read and didn\'t bother with the sauces, because I knew the meat would stand on its own. (I\'d hazard to guess that, had I chosen a sauce, it might have made me cry all over again.) I lingered over it. At some point, I swapped my Vesper for a Drifter, mixed with their own proprietary whisky, which added its own complementary note.\n\nAnd then, sticky toffee pudding. I grew up in Britain, and have had my fair share of these - but this eclipsed them all. The ice cream (more brown butter) perfectly offset the sauce and the pudding, while the pudding itself wasn\'t cloying or stodgy. This is a miracle for a British pudding.\n\nI didn\'t want it to end. When it did, and I stumbled through the neon tunnel back into the smoky reality of Paris, Las Vegas, nothing quite seemed the same.'

Be sure to clarify tap water or else you'll be charged 9 dollars for a bottle of water though!

S"I was disappointed with our experience.  I expected a five star, fine dinning experience. I expected a more sophisticated, intimate atmosphere.  My husband and I were seated at a small two person table which was so close to the next table, I could have eaten of the diners' plate at the other.   I had high expectations based on the cost per plate and Gordan Ramsay's name.  The first signs of my overall experience was the 'guided tour' from the hostess.  She found great pleasure in pointing out the red light that represented Gordan Ramsay's hand motion.  I was not impressed as I went to the steak house for a great dinner not to see an unimpressive light representing the hand motions of a celebrity chef.  The overall food quality was poor. We ordered the porterhouse steak which was significantly undercooked.  The baked  potato had been made hours before and asparagus was lack luster. I was surprised the chef expediting allowed the food to be served.    The service was also mediocre.  I was surprised to see all male servers.  We live in and work in a modern country.  Please hire female help.  The young lady bussing tables visited us more than our waiter.   We will not go back and do not recommend this establishment."

S'I bow down to you, Gordon Ramsay.\n\nAll the reviews say it. This place is amazing!! \n\nIt was a huge deal for me and my friends to come to Steak ready to splurge, especially since we\'re just a bunch of ordinary college students with a simple love of good food. But boy, was the price worth it. We were started off with a bread appetizer, which was superb! We especially enjoyed the two different types of brioche as well as the little sample of butter topped with a type of salt (I forget what type). We were even offered another round of bread and after a split second of "We don\'t want to fill up before our meal", we looked at each other with grins on our faces and agreed that we should never turn down free bread. \n\nMy friends ordered the Beef Wellington and I ordered the Ribeye for one along with the haricot vert, fingerling potatoes, and asparagus sides. The beef wellington was TO DIE FOR; it was extremely tender and flavorful, and the pastry on the outside was flaky and complimented the meat perfectly. Now I know why it is Ramsay\'s specialty (also note that it is cooked medium-rare). My ribeye was delicious as well as HUGE. It was cooked beautifully and didn\'t even need any sauces or extra seasoning. My favorite side had to be the haricot verts as I LOVE tempura and I don\'t know what they put in the batter...but it was better than any tempura batter I\'ve ever had in my life. The three of us struggled immensely to finish our plates (and we didn\'t), but knew that we had to fit as much of the delicious food into our stomachs as humanly possible. \n\nWe then decided to end with the three of us sharing the sticky toffee pudding, which was out of this world. I just remember stifling a laugh when the waiter asked us how our dessert was and my friend\'s eyes just rolled to the back of her head. He definitely got a good chuckle out of that. \n\nThe service was better than I could\'ve ever imagined. Every 2 minutes or so our waiter would walk by and make sure that our water glasses were filled and that all of our needs were met. One of the waiters even escorted my friend to the bathroom when she asked where it was! Whaaat? They were also probably the sweetest wait staff that I had ever had the pleasure of encountering and I honestly just wanted to give them all a hug as we left. \n\nAfter about 2 hours and $300 later, we all left more than satisfied, and ready to take on the town.'

Greeted instantly by the bartenders...drinks were FAST, and they even gave us the bar menu in case we were hungry while waiting.  Bar atmosphere is GREAT....Lots of mixed crowd..good energy.\n\nThe hostess then found us and took us to our seats (credit to be given, she did offer to carry my drink!--good job honey!)....we stopped and she pointed out the light fixture above everyone that is Gordon\'s hand movements when he prepares his most well known dish, beef wellington.  Gordon--that is SUPER cool! Very impressed and great conversation piece! Oh, and the hostess did wish my boyfriend and I a "happy anniversary"....thank you again!\n\nNow our FANTASTIC night began because our server, Dennis, introduced himself! LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE HIM!!!!!  When is comes to service, I expect HIGH QUALITY SERVICE AND TO KNOW THE ENDS AND OUT OF THE MENU, WINE LIST, AND RESTAURANT HISTORY!!! Dennis surpassed ALL of my expectations! ASK FOR DENNIS WHEN YOU ARRIVE!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!\n\nHe was so attentive, but not annoying about it! We asked for suggestions, he gave them, and they were right on!  \n\nThe beef tartar is yummy, and my boy loved the foie gras....Fish and chips were yummy(but we did expect more of the pub style...really the fish tail still on....uhhh), BEEF WELLINGTON FANTASTIC, mac and cheese AMAZING...LOADED BAKED POTATO AMAZING!! So much amazing food!!!! Did I mention the bread they start you with..PANCETTA bread.....IM IN HEAVEN!!!!! All dishes had an amazing presentation.....Next time, Im going for the beef...they have a meat cart that shows you the selections on the menu...oh yea baby, going for the porterhouse RARE!  I love that you have a meat cart!!!\n\nNo room for dessert...which was a shame, but I was barely going to be able to waddle to the cab........\n\nI LOVE this restaurant....I go to Vegas a few times a year, and I will ALWAYS stop at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  I LOVE Dennis....I will ALWAYS ask for Dennis!!!! This is the guy you want on your team! I LOVE THE FOOD!!!! Thank you for a great experience! \n\nLike I said earlier, WORTH EVERY SINGLE PENNY!'

S"My boyfriend and I are huge Gordan Ramsey fans. He particularly likes the Kitchen Nightmares and Hotel Hells. I like the Hells Kitchen and Masterchef. So since we were in Vegas we decided that we needed to try Gordan Ramsey's steak. I made reservations in advance and as soon as we arrived they seated us. \nOnce you step into Gordan Ramsey steak the atmosphere is so different than in the rest of the Paris Hotel. The ambience is wonderful and there is music playing. Pretty upbeat. The lighting is just dark enough to set the mood. Talk about service, first off they use an ipad so you van browse your drink selection. Pretty cool I would say. I would recommend getting a Total Rewards card and save a couple dollars here and there but the food was well worth the price.\nWe ordered a fillet of steak, clam chowder, duet of lamb, Mac and cheese and asparagus. The food was really good. My duet of lamb included a small shepherds pie and some lamb. The lamb was great and the garnish tasted very yummy. I was not really impressed by the shepherds pie but it's okay. The Mac and cheese was very good. \nThe service was great in itself. The waitress was on top of things and so were the rest of the staff. Everyone was smiling and friendly.

He was also so conscientious about the cleanliness of our table.\nChris, our above and beyond waiter, brought out the selection of steaks on a tiered display that looked like it was made for jewelry!  Two of us chose the Kobe Rib Cap since we have never had this steak.  I can't find and adjective to describe how delectable that steak was....  We ordered a few sides, mac and cheese, Brussels sprouts, and mushrooms, all perfect but the end to a perfect meal of course was the dessert.\nSticky Toffee Pudding with Brown Butter ice cream.  \nWe talked about this restaurant the next day, and on the way home on the plane.\nWe compared it to a dining experience we had 2 years ago in Venice.  \nMemorable, outstanding food, great service and will be back on our next visit.\nThank you Gordon Ramsay!!!"

S"My husband and I are huge fans of Gordon Ramsey. We watch all of his shows, especially Hell's Kitchen. We were vacationing in Vegas for the first time and just had to visit one of Ramsey's restaurants. I picked this one because they served dishes from Hell's Kitchen. However, the dishes could only be ordered from a tasting menu, a very expensive menu. I think about $145 per person. Ridiculous. \n\nI had the Market Green Salad. Not impressed. I had to get the beef wellington. It was delicious. My husband got the American Rib Cap. That was also really good. No dessert. We were too full. But I didn't find the dessert list that interesting.\n\nI didn't like was the fact that we couldn't order the risotto because it was on the tasting menu. If you're going to serve dishes from Hell's Kitchen, why force us to order everything else on that menu and pay $145 per person? Also, lobster capellini was not on the list.  \n\nI found it weird that they brought out the steaks to show us what they looked like before we ordered. Seemed a bit cheesy. The decor wasn't all that great.\n\nThe Yelp review says attire is Dressy but there were people there in jeans...\n\nHowever, the food was great. Service was great.

S'Okay. I won\'t go into detail about our entire experience, but I will point a few things out that I would like to have known pre-dining. We had a reservation and I am glad we did. This place was packed. We sat upstairs, right next to the staircase so we were able to not only look over the entire room, but we got to watch the food servers struggle to carry all of the food up the stairs for every table on the second level. Very entertaining. This place is open and loud and the club music that is piped-in only adds to the noise level. When your waiter asks if you would like a bottle of sparkling or plane water you may also opt for a bottle of house or tap water. We were not given the third option, but when asked if we would like a second bottle I asked about the different looking bottle that sat on a few surrounding tables and was informed that that way "just tap water", to which I replied "We will have one of the tap waters". Not a big deal, its done everywhere but GR bottled water is 8 bucks a bottle. That cuts into my cocktail budget. Our apps and steaks were perfect. We each ordered an addition of marrow for our steaks. One would have been enough for both of us. Kinda felt like the Fintstones with two BIG plates of at least 4 marrow bones, 4 to 5 inches each squeezed onto our 2 top with cocktails, entrees, bottle of water (tap) and water glasses. Server was a bit robotic, but the well prepared food was good enough to overcome that flaw. Pricey as expected. A great meal all around.'

S'Superb restaurant.  Steak very very good almost perfect. Probably one of the best steaks ever ( and I have been to many).  And the sides are excellent. Definitely would go back again if I go to vegas. Service was very friendly and genuine unlike alot of american restaurants whos service is all about the tip/ gratuities.  Conclusion: excellent food and service but alittle noisy (but hey we are in vegas.......what the hell turn up the music).'

S"We finally got to go to one of Gordon's restaurants, and it was well worth the wait!!! they roll a steak cart out to show you all the cuts of meat they serve, how cool is that!! I really wanted to try the famous Beef Wellington, but was a tad disappointed to hear that it automatically is medium to medium rare, unfortunately, I like medium well, but the NY steak did not disappoint!!  and the ribeye was to die for!  Our waiter was so nice, he even pointed out Gordon sitting at a table downstairs, I would have gone down to meet him, but he was already getting ready to leave, so I missed that. I completely recommend this awesome restaurant!"

S"very good. we got the beef wellington with a mashed potato puree, omigosh soooo good. The baked potato was NOT good to me, it didn't taste like a normal baked potato, had this yucky creamy cheese that was seasoned with too much garlic?? The mac n cheese was not tasty either, was oversalted in my opinion but the beef welli, ribeye and filet were awesome! very pricey though."

S'From the beginning to the end, this restaurant was an amazing experience. Yaron, our waiter, was so helpful and had a great personality. We had the pork belly appetizer which melted in the mouth. So yummy! For dinner, I had the bone-in ribeye and the flavor was outstanding. My fianc\xc3\xa9 had the Gordon\'s signature beef Wellington and that did not disappoint. We tried the fingerling potatoes and saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms both outstanding. Last but not in any way least, sticky toffee pudding for dessert! Every bite of everything left us with "O" faces. We can\'t wait to come back. You get what you pay for and we would\'ve paid double!'

S'This should be one of the best steaks you will ever consume....it definitely was for me.  I\'ve been here twice now, and each time, I had outstanding food.\n\nAtmosphere and setting is great...although the dress code is not enforced, it did not cheapen the night.   Service was excellent and above all, the food was amazing!  They also have a great wine and bottle selection, in all price ranges.\n\nThe comp bread selection :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA#Y31dBHh-ymp7NBmYSQbyDQ\n\nThe bread platter had a good variety! My favorite was probably the bacon bread...for good reason!\n\nThe dinner company wasn\'t craving red meat, so she went with the fish and chips.  It was unbelievably good....more like gourmet fish fillet with a slight breading and an  outstanding taste.  Yum\n\nI went with the ribeye...it was 24oz of 30 days dry aged beef.  :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA#2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA\n\nI could throw out a nice number of adjectives at you, and tell you cliche things, like how it melts in your mouth, but the truth tells itself :\n\nI ate the ENTIRE thing...AND almost every piece of fat that was on this thing.  The FAT was so tender on this ribeye, that it truly melted in your mouth, and gave the rest of the steak a super intense flavor when combined.  I seriously couldn\'t help myself...it was like a drug.  I was so stuffed, but I kept eating so that I could really savor each bite.  That "close your eyes, that was the best piece of cow I have ever consumed" feel.\n\nThe sides :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gordon-ramsay-steak-las-vegas?select=2RVsI-brRnb7mLO2h5JFPA#_JKeY5Vn87VtB_SOasPPCQ\n\nMac & Cheese : blue, cheddar, parmesan, and truffle. Fingerling Potatoes : parmesan and truffle. The mac and cheese here is great, but the fingerling potatoes blew my mind! There was so much truffle flavor hiding in between the potatoes....Probably the best way I\'ve consumed potatoes and truffles to date LOL!\n\nFor dessert, I have no idea how I fit it in...but we went with the toffee pudding or whatever it was called...excellent.  Not sure why this was so good, but it was one of my favorite desserts I have had to date....it just works.\n\nI will be back!  Trying to space out eating entire days worth of calories and fat intake in one setting lol.'

S"Gordon Ramsey Steak was amazing from the moment we walked in until the moment we left.\n\n Let's start from the beginning:\n Arrived early for our reservation and were seated at the bar while our table was being readied. Our bartender Neal, (I believe), made my friend and I, the two best dirty martini's we have had in a long time. The olive stuffed with blue cheese and bacon just made the drink that much better. Before we could take a second sip, our table was ready. \n\nOur waiter was Anthony. Steak should clone him. He was fabulous. He explained everything in depth with enthusiasm. He even pointed out things, like the neon light sculpture on the ceiling, that were particular to Steak. He made us feel welcomed.\n\nThe food:\nMy friend and I shared a Caesar salad. It was great. Just there perfect amount of dressing. the scotch egg was a treat.\nFor the main course there was a debate. I wanted the Beef Wellington and my friend wanted the Wellie and American Kobe Wagyu Beef Cap (she and I had never had that before.) We agreed to split our meat entries with each other. Well, after the first bite for each of us, we decided sharing was not going to work and gave each other a sliver of our steaks. The food was out of this world.\nFor desert we shared the Sticky Toffee Pudding. It was my friend's birthday and Anthony had a candle added to it. She felt very special.\n\nPrice - It's a steak house on the strip. It is not going to be cheap but for what was served and the service received it was worth it. It was about $130 per person including drinks (at $13 per x 4).\n\nI would recommend this restaurant as your fancy meal out when in Las Vegas."

S'the ambiance of the restaurant is great.  It was very sexy and hip. However, the music that was being played was so loud I could not even hear the couple across the table. it also took 20 minutes to get our first round of drinks and they were not particularly fast when we ordered second glasses of wine/cocktails either. The food was excellent as I expected but the service was sub par at best.'

S'2nd visit here last night - nothing but praise for the great restaurant.  Not the place to go if you are trying to save some money but fun for a splurge night out. The wait staff and hostesses give impeccable service. I was particularly impressed with mohamabu (sp?). He kept this pancetta bread loving girl well stocked all night and seemed to actually really enjoy and take pride in his work.  Food was amazing - perfectly cooked steak, delicious truffle fingerling potatoes, and finished off with the most ridiculously melty rich yummy sticky toffee pudding.  The music was also great!'

S"We just came here last week on the Vegas part of our honeymoon.  Unfortunately I made the mistake of not making reservations in advance and there weren't any tables left for the last couple of nights we would be there.  We couldn't leave Vegas without eating here so we opted to eat in the lounge/bar area which was still a nice atmosphere and provided us with a slightly more snug, but comfortable table after letting a few people pass us in line.  The only downside was the wait of 1hr+ to be seated, but it was barely noticed since we were enjoying watching Christine in the kitchen.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Chianti from the Ipad cocktail menu.  The prices were very reasonable and they provide a great selection of bottles from average to premium.  Since we were advised that we would be waiting at least 45 minutes for our entrees, we decided to order a couple of cocktails to start.  The Ipad came in very handy since it provided images as well as ingredient lists for each drink.  My wife ordered a Mojito, which wasn't on the menu and it was far too sweet for both of our palates.  I ordered an English Garden, which was an excellent cocktail containing Hendrick's, basil, lemon, cucumber.  It was definitely the best use of gin that I have ever experienced in a drink.\n\nOur meal started with a bread basket containing about 5 different varieties of bread.  The most notable were the 2 brioche, but the one containing pancetta specifically stood out.  We then followed up with an order of Short Rib Tortellini with foie gras, which was so good that my wife and I are still talking about it. \n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the bone-in strip loin with a bone marrow sauce and my wife ordered Gordon's acclaimed Beef Wellington, also the reason for our 45 minute wait which was well worth it.  My strip was cooked perfectly and was defintely one of the best steaks that I have ever had.  The bone marrow sauce was rich and added a lot of flavour, although I found if too much was used it overpowered the meat.  My wife's Beef Wellington was phenomenal; it was a beautifully tender piece of meat that could almost be cut with a fork alone surrounding by a perfect amount of light pastry.\n\nEven though we were both feeling fairly full at this point, we couldn't leave without trying Gordon's highly-renowned Sticky Toffee Pudding.  It was one of the most decadent desserts that either of us have ever tried.  The Brown Butter Ice Cream that it was served with could have stood up on it's own as a phenomenal dessert, but complimented the pudding perfectly.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend going to Gordon Ramsay Steak if you're in Vegas.  I know that any of our visits in future will include a dinner here, as well as reservations made well in advance."

S'We did the Gordon Ramsay Steak for our Wedding Anniversary. My wife has been wanting to try out Gordon Ramsay Beef Wellington as it has been the main signature dish for Gordon Ramsay. The entrance was great, they call it the chunnel which was supposed to be an ode to the connection between France and UK Channel + tunnel although I dont understand why the chandeliers had to be explained by the servers. Anyway on to the food. Since we are asian we are used to the beef being well done the rarest we would go for is medium. Beef wellington comes only medium rare. My wife went ahead and ordered the beef wellington and the taste was pretty good expectation were definitely met. The beef wellington was consumed in a few short minutes :).  I on the other had the 24 oz steak which is good. I should have tried the Wagyu version since I can cook the steaks I should have gotten something that I cant get at home although the meat was aged 28 days the taste is the same as the aged beef in Whole Foods or from our local butcher shop. The Service was very good which is expected since it is an expensive restaurant. The sides were great we had the octopus Remoulade salad which was done very well, octopus if cooked long becomes tough in Gordon Ramsay Steak it was soft.    The mac and Cheese with truffle butter was REALLY good I like the idea that the twist was using truffle oil in the mac and cheese and it tasted really good. We will definitely try other things on the menu if we decide to go on another dinner date at Gordon Ramsay Steak.'

S"This place was fantastic ! As a Hell's Kitchen fan I was very excited to be there. And even more excited when I was able to order from the HK tasting menu. The scallop risotto was perfect and I don't usually even like scallops. The quail egg was excellent and again I'm not usually a huge fan of eggs in general. Finally the famous beef Wellington. It was every bit as tasty as I thought it would be and then some. Desert was the sticky toffee pudding, a sweet date pudding cake, with Brown butter ice cream. It was delicious and though the butter ice cream is super rich it was a nice balance.\n\nThe antioxidant drinks were amazing too!"

S"2 stars because for the most part the service was ok.  For the price, my steak was not worth the money.  Had a medium rare ribeye advertised as prime cut but the meat was pretty tough.   I've had choice cuts that were less tough.  A person at the table had temp issues with the 3rd steak finally being correct.  $12 for a cup of french press coffee which gets shared with other people who order coffee! Really???  For $12 I want my own french press and my own creamer!  It's these types of celebrity chef branded restaurants that will keep me away from other ones in the future.  I'd rather eat at a place where they have to earn their money each night than and a place that relies on a TV personality brand.  Plus I think the iPad for the cocktails was stupid and not practical."

S"Awesome restaurant! There were a lot of highlights and even our least favorite items were still very very good:\n\nFoie Gras appetizer- beautiful small piece of foie with homemade English muffins which were a little thick and a jam that was a little sweet but still delicious\n\nSmoked beef tartar - good sized portion with super crispy home made potato chips. The smoky flavor was amazing the first bite but a little much on the 5th. It's an appetizer I think would be best shared.\n\nKobe rib cap and Strip - perfect temperature, charred edges, well seasoned . Just heavenly!\n\nBernaise was rich and flavorful, the peppercorn sauce had a nice pepper bite but the homemade steak sauce was a little strong. Good - but best eaten in small quantities (unlike the others which you can dunk steak into) \n\nSaut\xc3\xa9ed spinach is fine but nothing special\n\nFingerling potatoes were lightly covered in Parmesan - nothing earth shattering but very good\n\nTempura green beans come as a very large serving and are addictive. \n\nFor dessert the toffee pudding deserves the raves it gets. \n\nWould love to go back again!"

S"Ever since I heard almost a year ago that Gordon Ramsay was going to open a place in Vegas I just knew I had to put it at the top of my go to list.  After reading all the great reviews from travel websites, my expectations were as high as they could get. So were they met.... unfortunately not. Perhaps I had a bunch of f***in donkeys cooking my meal? Whatever the reason, Gordon Ramsey steakhouse was underwhelming for me. Let me start by saying the service was an impressive 5 stars. At any given time I had at least 2 or 3 staff waiting on the table, and all of them were outgoing, knowledgeable and totally professional. The highlight of the ordering process was the impressive meat carousel. Have you ever wished you could see Gordon Ramsays meat...now you can, wheeled out tableside on a cart in all its big and juicy glory..and the waitstaff can tell you all about it. I couldn't help but drool just a little at the site of this carousel filled with wonderful cuts of meat, however I had already made up my mind to order the famous Beef Wellington. Simone had a hard time deciding what to order so she made a meal out of three side dishes. Truffle Mac and Cheese, Grilled Asparagus and Tempura fried Haricot Verts ( Skinny Green Beans).  While waiting for our meal we were treated to an amazing bread assortment (this was actually my favorite part of the meal) The bread included Thyme & Rosemary Foccacia, a sticky bun thing filled with panchetta and another filled with shrooms, and a baguette bread with walnuts. On the side you get some fancy butter speckled with some fancy salt. Everything on the platter was so good I had seconds. Next came the Beef Wellington I was informed this was traditionally cooked medium rare, mine was actually closer to medium well, leading to an unfortunately tough piece of tenderloin baked between puff pastry and kinda bland mushroom pate. This was certainly not as good as I expected. Simone had a bit better luck, her Mac and Cheese was rich and creamy but was a bit overwhelming in the truffle mushroom flavor.  The asparagus was good and included morel mushrooms that were also pretty tasty but this was still an average dish. The green beans were also crunchy and tasty served with a Garlic Aoli, but again I've had better.  Gordon Ramsay is also famous (so I've been told) for his Sticky Toffee Bread Pudding, and this dish was the only one that really wowed me. The bread pudding was more like the best moistest cake you may ever eat and it was especially sweet and rich when drowned in the homemade caramel that is served with it. Also served with it is a deliciously sweet brown butter ice cream, this was so tasty I wish I could have had more.  This was a great ending to an only average meal. I so wanted to love Gordon Ramsey after all the hype but I walked away let down and surprised that the biggest let down off all was the steak. Only 3 stars for Gordon Ramsey Steakhouse."

S'The food was good but pricey.  I had the Bone In Ribeye 24 oz $57.00 served okay. But if you do not like sauce on your steak tell them to serve it on the side. My wife had the American Rib Cap 8 oz, $60.00 really not worth the price. Wine list is extensive but way overpriced. Based on their wine list I have a million dollars of wine in my cellar. Food wise a little above average. Now the downside. There are 2 levels, the main level is very noisy and cramped. The upper level is much nicer except the speakers are above you in the ceiling and the music was VERY load. You could not hear each other talk. We mentioned it to our waiter and he said they have a lot of complaints about the loud music. Forget a nice romantic evening, and for this reason I would never go back.'

S'Since we don\'t gamble in Vegas and had no interest in shows this go around, we decided to splurge for an amazing dinner.  My boyfriend wanted to try out some true, Kobe steak and we decided that the great Gordon Ramsay couldn\'t disappoint.  \n\nWe headed in with a good giggle over the hostess\' uniforms (black dresses, bright red lips and pocket watches as necklaces...they all looked like some weird vampire cult) and decided to grab a drink at the bar while we waited for our (reserved) table. This only took us around ten minutes, but I was already disappointed.  Their drink menu is pretty standard, focusing on lighter, fresh drinks that pair pretty well with the heavy menu.  I was very excited to see the English Garden came with "basil infused rock candy", having a sweet tooth and loving herbal drinks I thought this would be fun.  Unfortunately their \'rock candy\' is actually a brand of simple syrup instead of actual rock candy.  I thought this was rather underhanded. Everyone reading the menu expects actual rock candy, and I watched another girl go through the same disappointment as she got her drink. \n\nThings just continued to go downhill as we were seated.  The restaurant is rather dim and loud as other reviewers pointed out, but also they are trying to apparently cram as many people as possible into the place.  Our table for two was crammed in with several others along a bench seat.  I could barely get in (and I\'m on the small side) without worrying about jostling the table next to me.  Definitely ask to be seated in one of their booths if you have the option.  I was closer to the girl seated at the next table then my boyfriend at ours.   Along with the loud music this ruined any intimate atmosphere for the dinner. \n\nOur waiter was pretty decent, but pretty inattentive all around for this level of restaurant.  I also couldn\'t hear half of what he said, and it was too dark and our table not set up right for us to actually see anything on their famous wheeled mirror table to show off their meat \'tableside\'  (it was actually directly behind my boyfriend who was the only one interested and he couldn\'t even see it without getting out of his seat).  They also are very strict about only having  a tasting menu for part of the table, which I suppose makes sense in theory, but less in actual practice.  \n\nThat being said, even with me being as grumpy as I was as the meal started (I was trying to convince my boyfriend to leave), the food was phenomenal.  Everything from the delicious prosciutto bread starter (I could live off that alone for the rest of my life and be completely happy), to my beef wellington to my boyfriend\'s steak was absolutely perfect.  I could go on for paragraphs about the food, but I won\'t.  Don\'t come for the atmosphere, don\'t come for the drinks, but the food is amazing.  If you plan ahead (get a better table, skip the drinks and focus on the food), you will have a great experience.'

S"I took my friend here for his birthday back in October.  He and I both LOVE Gordon Ramsay on TV so when this place was slated to open, I just knew this was the perfect birthday spot.  We met early and got a martini from the bar, which were both perfectly made.  \n\nThe restaurant is pretty bright and there is a lot of red.  The ceilings are really high so it has a nice feel to it, but there is just something about the ambiance I didn't quite like.  Maybe it's the fact that the tables are so close to each other.  You can basically hear the full conversation of the tables next to you. \n\nThe service and food were both good.  The pricing is slightly more expensive than the other steakhouses on the Strip, but the food doesn't justify it. The only reason why is because of Gordon Ramsay's name. I REALLY wanted to love this place, but honestly, there just wasn't anything that blew me away.  It wasn't bad by any means at all, it just wasn't anything to get excited about."

Got to the steaks but bf ordered pork belly for appetizer,  beef wellington entree, truffle mac & cheese side and a pepsi. (For sodas, they ONLY have pepsi or diet pepsi, WTH?)\n\nI ordered foie gras for appetizer, crispy chicken breast for entree, chili lime corn for side and an infused peppermint iced tea. 4 stars because my chicken was a bit dry, well, it's breast so I guess that's why. I had a piece of the wellington and OMG it melted in my mouth! I am for sure coming back and ordering me some beef wellington all for my self! sides were alright. and for dessert, we ordered the sticky toffee pudding. that thing was excellent! (needed a little more ice cream, imo)\n\nSlow service to begin with, had a reservation, didn't sit until about half an hour. Great table service, not as excellent, great or whatever else other reviewers say. Maybe because we're Asian/we looked like we had no monies? I observed other tables had better service than ours =/\n\nAnyways, will we come back?! YES, I will give GR another chance!

S"I have loved Gordan Ramsey from the first episode I saw of Kitchen Nightmares on the BBC.  So it was obvious that when I was in Vegas for my sister's wedding, I had to go here. \n\nI made reservations online about 2 months in advance for myself, boyfriend, and another couple who shares the love for Ramsey also! That was quick and easy! \n\nWe arrived at 7 and we're brought right to our table. The hosts were super friendly and ours told us a little about the restaurant and decor. \n\nOur waiter arrived and he was amazing! Seriously top notch service, which should be at a place like this, but I had never had this type of experience. He was so funny and knowledgeable and gave us the perfect amount of time to decide what we want. He also brought over the cool meat tray so we could see the meats they have to offer. We ordered the kobe beef sliders, crispy pork belly, and foie gras for appetizers. Everything was delicious as expected. The foie gras was probably one of the best things I have ever eaten. I was hesitant to try it at first but it is so so flavorful and delicious! If there is one appetizer you try make it this! \n\nFor dinner I ordered the filet, my boyfriend had the beef short rip, and the other couple ordered the seafood mix and porterhouse steak. We ordered fingerling potatoes and truffle Mac for sides. Everyone ate every last bit! Steak was cooked perfectly and was so delicious! \n\nFor dessert we both had the sticky toffee pudding. OMG can I just eat this 24/7? Gooey, chocolate, crunchy, melty, everything you dream of goodness! \n\nI hope I can come back here next time I'm in Vegas, if for nothing else the dessert! Totally worth the price and the experience was great! Overall the dinner took 3 hours, which is sort of crazy, but was well worth it."

S'Located in Paris Hotel Casino on the Famous Las Vegas Strip. So I will start by saying that I think Mr. Ramsey is a bit of a bully, who is so critical of others food that his had best be impeccable. Close to impeccable but not as perfect as his insane tantrums would warrant. That being said everything is pretty great. I had the "Hell\'s Kitchen" seasonal price fix dinner. All was great, the beef wellington was just under great and a little disappointing as this is one of his signature dishes. I will say our server was great. I would also suggest that the signature cocktails have some more non gin options, I know it\'s supposed to British but how much nature boy can you get? Still worth a stop in for a special dinner.

S'Trendy modern design \nWould recommend reservations; no dress code other than no tank tops\nDiverse beef offerings, rolled up right to your table so you can see the cuts before you decide \nSplit the porterhouse for two- perfect size, very tender, a little too charred, didn\'t need any side sauce\nFingerling potatoes, Parmesan spinach, Mac n cheese were very tasty sides- size of sides is on the "smaller" size compared to other steak houses, but the taste & quality are on point\nS\'mores cheesecake was so good- heavenly & not too sweet; also a bit on the smaller side compared to other places, but delicious \nService- attentive at times, but also distracted; a tad condescending (he made sure I noted that the sides were all a la carte- um, I got it, I can read & I\'ve been to  other fine steak houses before, thank you!)\nHouse tap water is good thanks to reverse osmosis lol\nBonus- got to meet chef Ramsay himself & got a photo as he mingled with diners and checked in on the kitchen.\nI would come back, over all a very nice meal with quality and taste at the forefront'

S"Good, not great. Had the shrimp cocktail and prime ribeye. A $54 steak shouldn't need a $6 sauce to put on or dip in to make the steak taste great. My wife had the wagyu skirt steak that had good flavor. Hit Del Frisco or Ruth's for better taste, not to mention value."

S'We were in Vegas for a week.  Ran into a woman in the elevator who raved about this place.  Decided to try it out.  Boy, what an amazing experience!!!!! My husband ordered the porterhouse, which was good (very good) but not super great.  I ordered the Kobe filet and it was awesome.  Could cut it with a butter knife.  Slightly pricey.  What was a joy though was the service we received from Donnie and Mouhamadu.  Courteous, attentive and went above and beyond what you usually get in restaurants these days.  Thank you soooo much to these fine young men.  Worth the price!!!!'

S"Gordon Ramsay has done it again! This is the second Gordon Ramsey restaurant I have visited and it was fantastic. \n\nWe had a group of 3 and shared the bone marrow, crab soup, mac and cheese, fingerling potatoes, filet mignon, and bone in rib eye. \n\nAll of the food was flavorful and delicious. \n\nWe also tried their popular Hell's Kitchen antioxidant cocktail and it was refreshing and delicious too. \n\nOverall I would highly recommend Gordon Ramsey Steak if you are looking for an upscale dinner."

S'I have eaten here twice and I had a similar experience both times.  The service was very good!  The atmosphere was OK.  The food was average.  I have been to all of the top tier steak houses in Vegas and this would definitely not be in the top five.  Ramsey is a marketing genius and I am sure this restaurant will be a huge success due to his name recognition.  But if you want quality for the price check out STK, Nine, Cut or about a dozen others.'

S'I did not even eat here and still I am more impressed with this restaurant than any other. Do you want to know why? I came to the front of "Steak" around 11:30 on a Wednesday morning hoping to treat myself to a good lunch. When I approached the hostess she informed me that they were only open for dinner. I asked her if she had any recommendations for a good lunch and she unbiasedly suggested a French restaurant nearby. As I walked away I thought to myself, "What a classy joint this must be to pay a hostess to stand outside of a restaurant while they\'re not even open to help customers before they even come to eat. Leave it to a Gordon Ramsay establishment! A+.'

S"Two of us ended up at Gordon Ramsay Steak with no prior planning and in my case I had little knowledge of GR's background.  I know my cocktails and I know my beef - GRS delivered.  The Manhattan was served in more of a oversized snifter, but it worked.  I ordered it with GRS' signature Knob Creek - I still can't place the distinct flavor, but it was yummo.  Without a reservation on a busy Tuesday night, we managed a table in the bar area without a wait.  Service seemed as seemless as it would have been in the dining room.  The service was polished without being cloying.  Not one single menu item disappointed, and the filet mignon was cooked perfectly and was as good as it could possibly have been.  That being said, at the price point offered, I would have expected no less.  While the French Press coffee was as good as I've ever had, it too needed to be that good at $12.00 for a cup and a half.  The bill was about triple my business per diem, but for the last night in town attending a convention that always wears one out, GRS was the antidote to a long, stressful day.  Highly recommended, but bring a credit card with lots of room."

S'I was so disappointed.  We were there for 2 1/2 hours for the "Ramsey Experience"!  And the food was not that great.  For $145 per person I expected to be impressed.  The only thing that came quickly were the drinks.  Our "experience" included a quail egg (not bad, somewhat tasty), octopus (was supposed to be charred but my friend\'s piece was just burnt) scallop risotto ( had to send back because not completely cooked) and beef Wellington (now I know I don\'t like beef Wellington - missed their chance to impress me) and dessert was some sort of toffee thingy plus a couple of other treats.  I pretty much did not care at this point and did not like any of the desserts.  The loud pounding club music could have also contributed to my attitude.  Never again! Don\'t do it - not worth the price and definitely not worth the wait!'

We ordered fisher's man grill - $49.95 the plate was VERY small. That's fine with fine dining small portions, but I expected that each piece of item presented should be of top quality. BUT...\n\nLobster- small tail tasteless, over cooked\nMussels- 2 on the plate were the size of raisins\nSalmon- taste fishy\nTuna- tasteless\nScallops - 1 piece on the plate ( good)\n\nSide of spinach - $12\nThis is acceptable \n\nWould never go back again.\n\nNo wonder most of the restaurants he help failed a year or 2 after he left. He can't even take care of his own restaurant. If you have a failing restaurant, just close it. Don't be a joker on his show."

Food service was slow - quoted 45 minutes for meal to be ready (beef Wellington) took close to an hour (we had a show to see -which we informed server - that was 2.5 hours after our reservation time) - don't order Wellington if you have time constraints.  Wellington was nothing special.  Food was good but nothing spectacular.  The price points were high - we had an inexpensive bottle of red and total for 4 was over $400.  The next night we ate at firefly - for 10 people it was nearly $100 cheaper - the food was 10 times better, better service, more variety, better ambiance and overall much better dining experience.  Will never go back to Ramsey's."

The sides are very interesting and unique - I especially enjoy the potato puree. For desert, the Toffee Pudding is ridiculously awesome, and almost worth the trip just for that.\n\nIn my two visits, I found the staff at the front desk to be pretty cold.

S"One of the best reasons I'm happy to be alive is STEAK.  Life would be oh so boring without it.  For date night, we couldn't figure out where we wanted to eat at since we weren't too hungry and it was already 9:30pm...most places were closing at 10pm but thankfully, Gordon Ramsay keeps his doors open until 10:30pm.\n\nThe restaurant, especially the entrance, reminds me of a club...a well-lit club.  We didn't have a reservation so we sat at the bar area and didn't have to wait to get a table.  We were given an amazing plate of different kinds of bread. 2 were aged parmesan, 1 bacon, 1 mushroom and 2 lemony breads. In a world full of free sourdough bread, complimentary bread got exciting again. We got the medium rare 24oz dry-aged bone-in rib eye, fingerling potatoes and mac n cheese.\n\nDRY-AGED BONE-IN RIBEYE: their medium rare is bloodier than usual but I'd rather eat a bloody steak than a hockey puck.  It was tender and no sauce was needed. Just pure meaty perfection. 5/5\n\nFINGERLING POTATOES: with parmesan and truffle...they were flavorful. The perfect side for a awesome piece of meat 5/5\n\nMAC N CHEESE: with peas, truffle and 3 different cheeses - blue, cheddar and parmesan.  It was tasty, rich and quite heavy. 4/5\n\nFor personal reasons, we skipped dessert. The service was alright. For the price and quality of meat we got, I may have found a new favorite steak place in Vegas.  But no, I still love Mario Batali."

S"I'll keep it short. As with most things in Vegas, you get what you pay for. Try the shell fish appetizer- it has a high price tag for an appetizer but you won't have a better variety of fresh seafood presented to you better than this. The wagyu beef skirt steak (like most American wagyu, this wasn't real wagyu, but an incredibly close offering) was incredible! The beef Wellington was good except the dough fell off the steak because the knives weren't serrated to cut clean through. They don't do serrated knives because they claim it tears the meat. Disagree with that but that's ok. Overall great restaurant and you might get a chance to see a celebrity chef at work."

S'Im a huge fan of Gordon Ramsay, I always watch Master Chef, Kitchen Nightmares, etc etc. So obviously coming here I had huge expectations as I regard Gordon Ramsay to be a world class chef.\n\nI read the reviews on Yelp first to guide me as to what I should order. For our appetizers we decided on the Seared Fois Gras and the Kurobuta Pork Belly. Please note the appetizer portions are small, but they\'re not extremely small. The fois gras was fairly tasty, although some parts were a bit too squishy for my preference. The pistachio streusel and jam that are served on the plate with it were very rich, a little too sweet for my liking but overall pretty darn good. This was the first time I\'ve ever eaten Fois Gras, it was definitely a unique taste, and I could see it offputting to most, but I\'d order it again (if it were seared a bit more). As for the pork belly, that was really good. Best Pork Belly I have had. \n\nNow as a side note, they bring out these bread rolls to you. I believe 6 different types? Wow, these were excellent, and the one with bacon baked in to it? Give Gordon Ramsay the Nobel Peace prize. That was just incredibly delicious. Why have I never had bread with bacon baked into it before? I was in heaven, I requested more, yummy!\n\nAs for the dinner, I decided to go with their signature Beef Wellington and my sister had the 24 oz Bone in rib eye. This is where I was a bit upset, and the only reason this place doesn\'t get 5 stars despite their bread being phenomenal, their pork belly being the bets pork belly I\'ve ever had, and the dessert, OMG, that\'ll come later.... The Beef wellington comes one way and one way only, medium rare, that\'s fine, thats how I enjoy my steaks. My waiter told me it\'s served this way because if it cooked anymore the pastry would get burned. Anyhow, when I received my wellington I was really excited but at first bite I was quite saddened. The pastry was already a bit soggy, the beef texture just didn\'t seem right, although it was very soft, and the red wine demi glace just did not taste good at all. I pretty much avoided it completely. I had some of my sister\'s bone in rib eye, boy oh boy did it have a ton of fat on it, not trimmed properly at all... I would expect better trimming from a restaurant of this caliber. She additionally tried their signature steak sauce, which was just terrible. The steak tasted alright, but not any better than a regular ol\' steakhouse down the road. \n\nAnyhow, onto my dessert. We were stuffed and really didn\'t want dessert but the waiter said "If you don\'t like it, be honest, and it\'s on the house" so how could I resist? Which dessert did he suggest you ask? Three words.... Sticky Toffee Pudding! It came out, and to be honest the look doesn\'t do it justice. It just kind of looks like a warm cake, some sauce in the middle and an ice cream bar molded into the form of a stick of butter with a knife thru it... But wow, once you pour the sauce over the cake, and then combine the brown butter ice cream with it... Well, you\'ve got the world\'s greatest dessert hands down. I have never in my life had a tastier dessert and my sister agreed. This was just outstanding. I\'d go here just to order the dessert.\n\nAs for the service, A+. The waiter was very knowledgeable on all their food items, my water was always full, and I drink a ton of water. My only suggestion is to get rid of the multitude of bimbos at the hostess stand. There were 3-4 of them standing there when I arrived, and they all seemed confused.'

S"Went with a friend a few months ago to try it out since it was new. The ambiance and decor is very open and things like a large union jack gives it a very distinct british feel. The ipad drink menu was an interesting touch. I had the ribeye cooked medium rare and it was nice and tender. but towards the inner part of the steak it was more rare which I didnt like(I ended up taking it home and throwing it into a stew for flavoring and it was awesome btw!). Service was good and rest of the food was decent, nothing to complain about. Very expensive food, even though it was good, not sure if it's worth the prices here. Still, a solid choice if one is looking to splurge but I would think theres more affordable(read as still expensive but not as expensive as here) options available."

S"I totally love chef Ramsey and the last time I was in Vegas I stayed at the Paris and I saw them working on his restaurant and I was determined to try no matter what . So for my birthday hubby took me here and I have to say I enjoyed my birthday dinner to the fullest .. I was in amazement of the 2 floor restaurant  which the entrance served as a tunnel into London lead  into the bar and lounge area and then to the restaurant .  Had such awesome d\xc3\xa9cor and walking all around the restaurant everyone greeted you with a hello or welcome it was very nice . I had a blast with the drink menu which was on a tablet  .I also loved the meat cart with all the different types of steaks it was very well presented I must say . we were given a bread platter which was yummy but be careful one of the breads had walnuts which I'm allergic to but it was no big deal they gladly exchanged it for  a platter with out walnuts . We ordered the Kobe sliders which were so tasty and delicious and a little pricey but it was worth it .  \n\nNow for dinner my husband is obsessed with beef wellington and let me tell you that it was very tender and full of flavor and he said it was worth the 52 dollars . He said it was a well spent 52 dollars and highly recommend it to anyone . I ordered the 24oz bone in rib eye and let me tell you that rib eye was so damn tasty ,tender so full of flavor it was delicious and also worth 56 dollars I got to say you are paying for what your eating so to me it was totally worth it . our sides were  truffle mac n cheese and the fingerling parmesan truffle potatoes which both sides were tasty, delicious and cooked perfectly not dried out and the only thing I didn't like was the mac and cheese had green peas but hell I hate that's how good they were and for people who know me I Hate peas   .His cocktails also had lots of flavor and can you taste the liquor it was a sweet cocktail but with a kick and for 14 dollars it was also worth every sip . . By time dessert came we ordered the chocolate layer cake which was very good but I was a big of the passion fruit filling but other wise it was good . I was very happy hubby celebrated my birthday here it was worth it all the way .  Plus of your a total rewards member you get a few dollars off as well which isn't it too bad . I loved Gordon Ramsey steak house and cant wait to come back again that's for sure \n\nkeep up the good service and excellent food I enjoyed it so much if you can splurge then try it because I don't think you will be disappointed at all"

S'My husband and I went for dinner here for our post-wedding dinner. We made a reservation for 530pm but they were able to seat us early which was very appreciated. The ambiance was lovely and we were seated in the most comfortable chairs I have ever had the pleasure to sit in at dinner (I mention this because you will feel like you need a chair to wallow in after eating so much). \n\nThe drink menu is on an IPad, which was neat because you get pictures and descriptions of all drinks so it makes choosing easier. Sort of. We had about 4 different cocktails because they all looked so good it was hard to narrow it down. We were served a fancy little bread plate and ordered the ravoli for an appetizer (delicious!).\n\nMy husband ordered a filet, I got the beef wellington, and we had the mac n cheese and buffalo carrots as sides. The steak is amazing, but I urge you to order the beef wellington! It is rare to find it on a menu anywhere and it is one of the best things I have ever eaten, hands down. The sides were excellent, and as they are served family style there is plenty to go around. \n\nPlease get dessert, and make it the toffee pudding. I wanted to cry a little because it was so good. \n\nAs far as the service is concerned- our waiter was wonderful, our drinks were never empty, and our table was always clean, organized, and full of food. It was an absolutely lovely dinner and I cannot wait to go back.'

S"My wife and I have been trying to hit celebrity chef restaurants when we are vacationing. Being fans of Hell's Kitchen and being in Vegas, we decided to try Gordon Ramsay Steak.\n\nWhile being taken to our seats, the hostess explained some of the reasons for the design. I had a little trouble hearing her, due to the music being so loud (not uncommon in a lot of casinos in Vegas). We had a nice table near the kitchen, so we could see much of what was going on in the restaurant. The restaurant was busy, tables were full and waiters were constantly moving.\n\nWhen the waiter brought the menus, we were also presented with a showing of several of the meats. Reviews had suggested the Rib Key, which I order along with a baked potato.. My wife had the duet of lamb and the creamed corn.\n\nMy steak was amazing. It just melted in my mouth. My wife said it was some of the best lamb she had ever had.\n\nOur one real nitpick of the restaurant was the temperature. It was very warm. While we were near the kitchen, there didn't seem to be a lot of airflow where we were.\n\nWe do highly recommend giving Gordon Ramsay Steak a try."

S'To preface this review, I must say I really wanted to like this restaurant. I made reservations a couple months in advance. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary. \n\nWe only waited a minute or two to be seated. Our table was facing the kitchen, which was kinda cool. The music was "club like" and relatively loud, but we enjoyed it. We started by ordering drinks using the iPad menu. It took a while for our drinks to arrive (not only the initial drinks, but also subsequent drinks). We then ordered the onion soup (which was good) and Caesar salad. We ordered an appetizer, the Maine Lobster stuffed with chorizo. I do not recommend this appetizer. It was very small, cold, and very tough. We were honest with the waiter and he mentioned something to the chef. Next, we ordered our entrees. Beef Wellington, Prime filet, and a couple ounces of the A5 Japanese Kobe filet. The Beef Wellington was ok. We did really enjoy the Prime filet. I wouldn\'t wasted the money on the Japanese Kobe. The outside was charred and inside really had no taste. I had this once before at another restaurant and really enjoyed it, but the preparation was not acceptable this time. We also ordered the truffle mac and cheese, as well as the potato puree. Both sides were very good. \n\nNow, I realize I am not a restauranteur, but I\'ve been to a variety of high end restaurants. I know good service when I experience it. Here are some tips that could change my rating from 3 stars to 5 stars.\n\nTIP #1: If I have a customer who has flown across the country to share a special event, such as an anniversary, I would at a minimum acknowledge it. This did not happen in our case.\n\nTIP #2: If a customer has an issue with any part of the meal, I would insist either the chef or manager to acknowledge the mishap and try to correct it. A little feedback goes a long way.\n\nTIP #3: If I am a manager of a restaurant, I would attempt to greet the customers to ensure everything (food, service, etc.) is top notch. The customers are the best source of intel. \n\nTIP #4: If I worked for one of the world\'s top chefs and restauranteur, I would go out of my way to be the best, instead of being a social butterfly within the restaurant. On multiple occasions, I spotted our waiter engaged in extended conversations with two guys in suits (one with a bow tie). They appeared to be some type of management, but we cannot confirm that since they never introduced themselves. \n\nWe were very disappointed with the overall experience of this restaurant. The lack of attentive service was probably the most disappointing thing. My wife and I had higher expectations for this restaurant.\n\nIn summary, if you are looking for a good high end restaurant in Vegas, I would consider another restaurant, such as STK or Craft Steak. Hopefully, management and the wait staff will take a look in the mirror and bring their standards up to the Gordon Ramsay expectations.'

S'Astoundingly good.  Came here for my 30th birthday and had one of the best steaks of my life.  My bone-in ribeye was perfectly cooked and an amazing cut of steak.  Topped with a generous portion of seared foie gras I really can\'t recall ever having a better steak.  The bread service was great, and the cocktails were all perfect.  Good beer selection as well.  I couldn\'t care less about this being a "Gordon Ramsay" restaurant but if you\'re in Vegas and would like a great steak you could do a lot worse.  Just note that this place has a loud clubby atmosphere, so if you\'re looking for a quiet dinner this isn\'t your place.'

S"First time at gordan Ramsey's steak here in Vegas, was impressed with the overall look and design and atmosphere of the place but the quality of service and attentiveness was below what I would've expected from a restaurant of this caliber and notoriety. Had to seat myself down by the bar and wait nearly 15 minutes before any of the wait staff even came to me. Them had to wait another 15 minutes for my drink order. I realize it was busy when I arrived but still feel it was a bit too long for my drink. Only got checked on about twice during my entire 2 hours I stayed and felt the staff were paying more attention to the other guests. It's such a shame since I'm a big regular at Ramsey's other restaurants as a huge fan of his but I'm afraid I may not ever come back here again or recommend to my friends family and business associates."

I wanted a Wellington ever since Hell's Kitchen started. Nothing like I ever tasted, just melts in my mouth. With every bite, I couldn't stop smiling. For the sides I had seasoned asparagus and bleu cheese Mac and Cheese, baked! I can't even begin to tell you what this tasted like. Simply amazing!\n\nFor dessert I had the sticky toffee pudding, the pick of the year. Wow, my tastebuds exploded with such sweet flavors. \n\nOverall, the experience was great! Will definitely do this again."

S"Absolutely one of the best restaurants in Vegas right now hands down!! \n\nAmbiance is very cool and detailed.\n\nFood is outstandingly deliciously melt-in-your-mouth excellent! Had the sliders. Wow. So much flavor. Tender, juicy, flavorful... best ever! Steaks were amazing, tender but with real flavor. Fingerling potato were like an unbelievable an explosion of flavor. Truffle + Potato = awesome! Coffee with liquor spoons are so fun and cool. Very unique and delicious. Sticky toffee pudding (piping hot date cake with caramel sauce and brown butter ice cream) is one of the best you will ever try. I've been to England many times and never had anything this good. \n\nSERVICE WAS OUTSTANDING. \n\nI have been twice. At the bar Amanda was really amazing. Very sweet and engaging but professional as the same time. Her steps of service, timing, table maintenance was impeccable. Best I have ever had at a bar. Manager stopped by (Mike?) was super cool. Totally knew his stuff and was professional, personal an friendly. Perfect Manager. \n\nThe second visit Abraham was our server. Probably the best server that has ever waited on me. He had a extremely warm, friendly and cool attitude and seemed sincerely interested in my experience. His knowledge and descriptions of the food made my mouth water and were A+++. His recommendations were perfect, each one lined up with what we would have wanted. The timing was perfect, table maintenance was perfect. Level of engagement was spot on. \n\nIn my opinion this restaurant really adds some foundation to the celebrity name of Gordon Ramsay and his shows. He is not just a talker but knows how to set a place up to execute a  perfect dining experience. \n\nIf you're in Vegas this place is a must!"

S'Go here and at least order the Sticky Toffee Pudding dessert!!\n\nI ate here back in October with my cousins and boyfriend and it was an experience we\'ll never forget! \n\nFirst off, our server Adrian was THE BEST! He made our dining experience memorable with his fast and personable service. He offered to take our picture when our food came, he cracked jokes with us and he came back at the end of the night to tell us we were his favorite table. \n\nAs for the food: I had the bone in Rib-eye which was one of the best steaks I\'ve ever had! My cousin had the rib cap which was superb! The chicken and the porkchop were also delicious, as were our sides of haricot vert, asparagus and potatoes. We were all pleased and stuffed. \n\nAnd then the dessert came. STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING. OH MY GOODNESS. It was just pure amazement. I took a piece of the warm cake, added a spoonful of the ice cream (shaped like a stick of butter!) and as soon as I tasted this concoction, the clouds parted and the heavens opened up to a joyful choir. It was pure bliss that I didn\'t want to end. It\'s one of those foods that reflexively make you eyes close and your lips hum out "Mmmm". \n\nI cannot wait to go back to Vegas just for this dessert! My mouth is literally watering just thinking of it.'

I asked for drawn butter as I always do when I order high end steak, instead the waiter offered me a herb butter which  did not taste good ( I later find out I was charged for the 4 slices of butter) .

Every time he came to our table, it was with a huge smile and new birthday wish! His menu recommendations were spot on and his enthusiasm was second to none! Adrian, his assistant has such genuine and positive energy and they really made our night special. Oh and then there's the food...wow! I had the filet and like it med-well. Dennis suggested they butterfly it. I have never been offered that at any steakhouse...it is my new way to order it...it was cooked all the way through, no pink (no fun for most people but just the way I like it)...all the while not compromising the juice factor and the flavor. Oh, the melt in your mouth flavor! My husband ordered the rib eye cooked medium and it was perfection on a plate! The potato puree was like the world's best mashed potatoes! Rainbows and unicorns appear when you put a forkful in your mouth and tranquil music plays as they melt on your tongue. The drinks were amazing...something about the special glasses  they choose for each made them taste that much better! We finished with the Sticky Toffee Pudding and the peanut butter something or other...they were delectably delicious! The ice cream for each is presented like a stick of butter with a little ice cream butter knife...so bizarre yet wonderfully fun and yummy! We are locals and will be back!

S"I came to Gordan Ramsay's Steak with a group of friends last night. We all concluded that it was absolutely nothing special at all and 4 out of 6 people in our party did not care for their steak at all. The flavoring in the steaks were completely absent and there was just nothing special at all about the food. I will say the tartare and the Sea Bass my friend had was very good but that was really the only thing anyone in our party liked. The service was also nothing special which you would expect out of a steakhouse labelled as $$$$ on Yelp. Lastly, the restaurant is extremely loud. I'm not exaggerating when I say that you have to shout when communicating with people at your table. I won't be coming back and I will not recommend this place to anyone. Again, just nothing special at all and it was actually pretty pricey at $250 per couple."

Our server was attentive until we ordered, my husband wanted the taster menu and I did not he said we had to both order it, that I don't understand, so we couldn't get it, my husband was very disappointed , and only for a mere $145. I got the lobster app $28 it had a nice tasting sauce but could not cut the lobster, my husband got the octopus salad which I loved. The Mac and cheese was tasteless I took one bite and so did my husband, ugh. The beef Wellington was really good it would have been fantastic if it was not room temp and my tuna was ok.

S"As long as you love me\nWe could be starving\nWe could be homeless\nWe could be broke at...GORDON RAMSAY STEAK! - Biebs (as long as you love me)\n\nThis place just debuted in May and it wasn't open the last time I was there not too long ago so I was excited that there was a new restaurant with a headline television chef. I made reservations for friday night and while we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated, we got a really nice booth out of it so it was worth it. \n\nWe started off with the pork belly appetizer, which was pretty good. The problem was that the bread and appetizer came out super fast and we had to wait a while for the steaks and the beef wellington. Granted, they told us it would be a long wait but we had to order Gordon's signature dish from 'hell's kitchen.' In addition to the kobe beef filets and beef wellington, we added foie gras to our entrees and fire corn and spinach on the side. I will miss the foie gras in california soon, but I won't miss the corn and the salty spinach. The steaks were sooo tender and juicy, and the beef wellington was a mouthful of goodness. All in all, the main dishes were excellent but the side dishes and everything else were less than average for a fine dining steakhouse. I think they don't focus enough on the sides so there's definitely room for improvement in this area. However, service was pretty sweet and entertaining at the same time so I will bump my overall rating by a point.\n\nFood: 4 stars --- Service: 4.5 stars --- Atmosphere: 5 stars --- Price(value): n/a"

S'Ive been to 4 Gordon Ramsay restaurants: Gordon Ramsay London (Royal Hospital Road), Tokyo at the Conrad hotel, New York at the London Hotel and Los Angeles at the London Hotel and this is my fifth Gordon Ramsay restaurant visited.  \n\nI\'d have to say that out of the 5 restaurant Gordon Ramsay Steak in Las Vegas was the friendliest by far.  Every server, cocktail server and host were excited to be working there and were fans of Gordon Ramsay and his television shows.\n\nOur server was Donnie, and he did everything he could to make sure it was the best meal ever.  He chatted with us about Gordon Ramsay and recommended courses, he even made sure that we were able to taste the Toffee Pudding (which was amazing) even though we had paid for a tasting menu with a different dessert.\n  \nThe sommelier was also very friendly and brought us a great wine at request.  He noticed that we were twins and mentioned that his older brothers were twins.  We arrived early for our reservation and were told we could sit in the lounge so we ordered some signature cocktails (Pimms very nice and HK antioxidant - which was probably the best drink), and we were seated next to some patrons who were having dinner and the conversation was easy if you watch any of Gordon Ramsay\'s shows.  They said that this dinner was by far their best experience in Vegas so far.\n\nAfter explaining that we\'d been to other Gordon Ramsay restaurants our server explained that the scrambled neon light in the center of the Union Jack on the roof of the restaurant was actually a recording of Gordon Ramsay\'s movements while making a Beef Wellington.  He explained that he was new and another sever Ian had explained that to him.  Later in the meal, Ian came by to same "hi" and he was super nice just like everyone at this restaurant.\n\nThe food was amazing.  We had the tasting menu with an amuse bouche of a scotch egg (made with a quail\'s egg) and the best salad any of us have ever had, with heirloom tomatoes and cheese, then the main course of Beef Wellington and a melon sorbet dessert.  The food was really delicious and well thought out.\n\nWe will definitely come again, we\'re hoping to do our rehearsal dinner here for our upcoming wedding in Vegas.  Thank you Donnie, Ian and everyone who made our experience so memorable! :-D'

S"Absolutely the best dining experience I have ever had. The ambiance and restaurant design was elegant and upscale yet unpretentious, with an avant-garde and polished twist on a rather classic, almost gritty British-pub feel. The centerpiece ceiling light of Chef Ramsay's hand movements as he prepares a beef wellington dish was a great creative decision for his personal signature. \n\nI had the limited edition tasting menu. Every dish was executed with a precision, finesse, and inspired vision such that it triggers not only gustatory pleasure but artistic appreciation comparable to what one experiences through fine literature or music.\n\nThe kitchen managed even to take the common Scotch egg in an unique direction by pairing it with some lovely red-wine braised cabbage, whose slight acidity and moist freshness had excellent synergies with the texture and heavier flavours of the egg. Moreover, every bite of all the dishes, down to the side vegetables, was packed with interesting flavour. It goes to show that they do not cut any corners and make every component with conviction. \n\nThe service was great as well. The wine expert obviously had extensive knowledge, and makes great recommendations. Food service was timely and well orchestrated, with just the right amount of time between dishes. Our waiter Charles was very friendly, professional, and told some great anecdotes. \n\nOverall, it was a very satisfying experience. My greatest compliments to Chef Ramsay and Chef Christina!"

S"As close to perfection as one could ever reach, so was our experience at Gordon Ramsay.\nI will start off my explaining my 4 star review:\nFood: beyond perfection perfectly executed with flavors that were incredible- even the coffee is top notch! \nService: excellent in every way.\nI think overall that the tasting menu is truly the only way to go and our 5 course meal was worth every penny along with our folded menu and signed photo of Gordon to take home and treasure from our event.\nMy only complaint overall and not a big deal is that I feel the tables are a bit close together and while dinner took almost a full 2 hours, it almost felt a bit rushed. \nMake a reservation as we did because you want to have a great experience.\nI wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to a friend and to celebrate a special event. And I hope I get to experience this again in my lifetime."

S'I was really amped up and ready for the best steak and meal of my life, based on the reviews from yelp I had seen and because well, it\'s Gordon Ramsay!  Sadly, was disappointed and won\'t be returning here.\n\nTried to get reservations about a week in advance, but all they had was 10PM or later.  Considering we sometimes can be passed out in bed at that time in Vegas (depending on how the day drinking goes), we decided to risk it and opt to see if we could get a table in the lounge right at the opening time.  Well, it worked!!  We were able to get in right around 6PM when we walked up and needed a table for 4.  \n\nThe atmosphere was pretty nice.  Great decor and the tables had this cool light on them.  Waitresses wear these sexy sequined short dresses, which made for good conversation and eye candy for the men.  I ordered a blueberry vodka and club soda, which was delicious.  The other 3 in my party didn\'t order anything to drink (husband was already drunk and the other couple don\'t really drink much).  However, looked like they had a great wine selection and they give it to you on an ipad, which was cool.\n\nAs for what we ordered....my husband and the other guy with us both ordered the kobe steak, I ordered the salmon, my friend ordered the seafood platter.  For starters, I got the salad and one other person got the shrimp cocktail.  They were both fine.  Nothing to rave about and not disappointed there, really.  \n\nThen the food came out.  So my salmon was barely lukewarm in the center and had NO flavor whatsoever.  I ordered mushrooms on the side and they were "ok".  My husband\'s kobe steak (which was $80, I do believe!!) was "ok".  It was rarer than "medium" which was how he ordered it, but didn\'t want to send it back given the crowd and how long it might take.  It was good (I tried it), so don\'t get me wrong.  But I\'ve had better steaks that were 1/2 the price.  He ordered the mashed potatotes on the side which were really delicious!  Go for it!  I would say the salmon was on the list of bottom 10 salmon dishes I have ever tried.  Maybe it was an "off" night or something for that dish.  I know they are known for the steaks, but....  Also, I don\'t even think the waitress ever came back and asked how the food tasted, or we might have told her some of this feedback.  Maybe she didn\'t ask because she knew.  haha\n\nThe total bill was $425 for 4 of us (I had one cocktail and nobody else drank, so this was truly all food..no dessert for anyone either!)  Very pricey for "so so" food, in my opinion.  We have a chain restaurant called "Firebirds" here that I would go to everyday for steak and/or salmon before I went to Gordon Ramsay\'s.  Even if they were the same price I\'d still choose Firebirds.\n\nHopefully Gordon goes to his restaurant and experiences the place like we did. Then he\'ll yell at the chef and things will change for the better.  :-)'

I'm using the KISS method, please let me know if you like this style.\n\nK- the place is really clean, very immaculate and the decor was great. There was no dust in sight.\n\nI- the place was immaculate, the hostess was very accommodating and dressed in professional clothes. The waiter and the helpers really represented the restaurant well.\n\nS- the service was grade a awesome. They put the napkin on your lap when they seat you. They let you see what the steak looks like before you order it, kind of like a desert tray. The water that they used was in a wine type bottle, so they used grade a water. The wait time was exceptional, and everything came out at the right time. They were also very attentive to us and filled our water whenever it was empty.\n\nS- overall satisfaction was good. This review would have been 5 stars but the steak was dry and not juicy at all. It was kind of shocking, I had the filet mignon. All the sides were really good, they had a great alcohol selection too. \n\nOverall, this place was great, the steak was good but not as good as I thought but everything else was just perfect!"

I ordered the chicken plate, it was ok the flavor was similar to Chipotle Mexican grill chicken. Not bad but I expected more from this place. The baked potato was ok too the pork belly on top of it is delicious!! The steak was good although one of the steaks was rare instead of medium rare but I guess that's always debatable. My friend got the sliders she was happy with them. She also ordered a mixed drink was delicious and outstanding! The staff was very prompt to get my plate to me after the long wait. But it was not very enjoyable I would have preferred to go somewhere else especially for the price being paid for these plates. This place is ok, just don't order the chicken it is not worth the price or time u have to wait to receive the food. Definitely skip this place! It's not all that and a bag of chips!!"

The restaurant has a very cool entrance (a replica of the chunnel) and it has a very cool vibe and decor.  We had an amazing meal - we started off with the Kobe beef sliders which were super tasty.  Then I had the beef short ribs which were AMAZING - soooooooooo good.  My husband had the American Kobe Beef filet which was the best cut of meat the restaurant had and he LOVED it.  He also ordered the Mac and Cheese as a side and it was heavenly.  The best Mac and Cheese I have ever had.  \n\nBy the way, for drinks the strawberry martini was unreal.  It wasn't overpowered with strawberry flavor it was just right and sooooo delicious!  We then had desert which of course was just unreal.  We ordered the sticky toffee pudding desert and the chocolate layer cake.  The toffee pudding was one of the most delicious deserts I have ever had - it was so moist and it just melted in your mouth.  The chocolate cake was also super good but it was a pretty small serving on it.  Just 3 bites worth but it was an amazing three bites!  \n\nOverall an excellent meal and we can't wait to go back!

S'We had the recommended flagship 5 course dinner which with a couple drinks pushed about $200+ per person. Although the food tasted pretty good, the overall atmosphere and meal as a whole just fell far short of my expectations.\n\nThe courses are very small and take a while to prepare. The beet salad and mushroom risotto were very good but tiny. The main course was beef wellington which surprised me since it wasn\'t one if the better cuts of steak and is baked in a layer of pastry dough! I guess I just didn\'t realize what that was. For the cost and the name of the restaurant being "Steak", I figured a better non-breaded cut of meat would have been the flagship recommendation.\n\nThe desert was also way to big a rich to even get through half of.

S'After a week of so-so meals in Vegas, I was looking forward to a fantastic meal Thursday evening.  Gordon Ramsay Steak in The Paris was just opening, and my guest and I lucked out in getting a seat for dinner in the lounge.  \n\nUpon entering through the red-lit tunnel, I was impressed by  the restaurant\'s striking design. We were escorted to our table and quickly read through the mouth-watering menu.  For an appetizer, we ordered the Seared Ahi Tuna.  For entrees, we ordered the Beef Wellington and the Beef Short Rib. \n\nAlthough the entrees were truly 5-star-worthy, we found the tuna to be absolutely and shockingly flavorless.  When we informed our server, she responded by saying, "Oh, really?"  Later, a bus boy came to remove our appetizer plates.  When he noticed that we had barely touched our $22 appetizer, he asked how it was.  I told him it was nearly flavorless.  He said that he had already heard the same from three other tables.  He removed the dish and told us he would inform the chef.  Unfortunately, no one offered to substitute out another dish for the one we had barley touched.  Perhaps the newly trained staff just didn\'t know how to respond to guests not enjoying the food, but I expected them to care (at the very least).     \n\nI incorrectly assumed that the dish would be removed from the bill.  It wasn\'t.  After finishing the meal and paying, I asked to speak with the manager.  I explained the situation, and explained that we had already paid.  She said she was sorry, and to ask for her by name the next time we were in town.  I believe she said her name was Nicole.  Given my high expectations for a restaurant bearing Gordon Ramsay\'s name, I was disappointed that she seemed slightly unconcerned.  I was shocked that she didn\'t offer anything besides an apology. \n\nAlthough the entrees definitely met our expectations, I cannot give this restaurant a better rating at this time.  I realize this won\'t be everyone\'s experience, but it certainly was mine. \n\nA five star restaurant with one star service, gets three stars.  \n\nUntil we meet again, Gordon Ramsay Steak...'

S'We first came to the Fireside Lounge just before Halloween. I had read about this place in the Nevada AAA travel book. It is not as upscale and modern as places in the Bellagio or elsewhere, but we were not expecting it to be. I was delighted with the decor and found it very comfy, cozy, intimate and fun. The AAA travel book said they the waitresses would "treat you like big shots" but they did not, and that was OK too. But our waitress was prompt and friendly. They have some really cool huge drinks, and we saw a HUGE plate of nachos on the table next to us. We ordered some appetizers and they weren\'t gourmet or anything but they were fine. Prices are better than most lounges we\'ve been to on the strip. We sat in a cozy corner but next time I\'d like to sit by the fireplace.\n\nThen we went to the Peppermill Restaurant on Thanksgiving Day. We were well aware that this holiday dinner was not all-you-can-eat and that was perfectly fine with us. We made reservations but there were plenty of available tables. We also told our waitress we would take advantage of their senior citizen discount on the Thanksgiving Dinner. I ordered the key lime martini which was fabulous. Love that the rim of the glass is covered in graham cracker crumbs. The Thanksgiving dinner was excellent and was as tasty as a good homemade Thanksgiving feast. We had driven across country and loved that everything tasted homemade.  It exceeded our expectations. Our waitress went off shift and another came to take care of us the rest of the meal.\n\nNow here comes the problem and why I only gave a 4 star rating. When we went to pay, the cashier snapped at us that there was no discount on the Thanksgiving dinner. So I promptly picked up the little Thanksgiving dinner flyer on the hostess desk behind me and showed her that it was in writing about the senior discount. Well, then she huffed, "you\'re supposed to tell your waitress when you are seated." We told the cashier that we did tell our waitress we wanted the senior discount but we had a change of waitresses during our meal. So then she had to leave the cash register to confer with our waitress and manager or whoever and came back and took our money. No "thank you for dining with us" or "have a nice holiday" or anything. Nothing. Just a pissy attitude. Here we had had a wonderful Thanksgiving meal and then had to battle this old bitty. Because it was a holiday and I didn\'t want to ruin my husband\'s day, I didn\'t argue with her over her bad attitude or ask for the manager. Had I pushed the issue, we probably could have gotten a comp or something for her being so rude. We left. \n\nI would go back to the Fireside in a heartbeat, but probably not the Peppermill. They lost our business and that is too bad because we love the Fireside. I just don\'t want to risk a bad experience there again with another employee.'

I had chicken soup and a BLT and I wish I had been hungrier because the sandwich was awesome.

We had about 30 min. to wait to be seated, so we played some video blackjack in the lounge and had some screwdrivers. Ended up winning enough to cover our monster breakfast. I had the Marco pollo omelette, my wife had the eggs benny and we barely touched the massive serving of hash browns that accompanied both dishes. Service was very friendly from the lounge to our server to the cashier. Will make this a regular Vegas stop."

S'I think my anticipation level had reached it\'s apex as I pulled up to entrance. After all, the stream of gushing, effusive Yelp reviews certainly did a lot to get me excited. I was expecting to enter a world straight outta "Boogie Nights" or something, but what I got was a decor that looked decidely more "Scarface" than "Casino". The tacky blue neon lighting and faux foliage made me feel like I was stuck in the 80\'s. I kept expecting our waitress to bring out a complimentary mountain of "booga suga" just to get the feast off to a rockin\' start. \n\nThe food here was adequate in quality and price. I got the chicken foccacia sandwich with fruit salad. The sandwich was a heavy meal, due in no small part to the bread, so I opted to ditch the carbs and mow down on the avocado and breast a la carte. The fruit "salad" was just a bowl of honeydew and cantaloupe and one single grape. Maybe I\'m wrong, but a salad, to me, consists of a multitude of various fruits and such. That\'s like saying a lettuce and croutons is a salad. Not to me it ain\'t.\n\nI think my party and I should have headed into the lounge after our meal, since that seems to be all the rage. I\'m not sure why we didn\'t. Perhaps we were clouded in our thinking after such a filling meal. Alcohol is pointless on such a full stomach; it does nothing but further my bloat. Still, this was a blast from the past and well worth our time to check out.'

S"It was good, but it didn't meet my Yelp great expectations.  It was also not really worth the loooooong walk out there.  I read someone's review saying it was just past the Wynn, but it is WAY past the Wynn, for anyone who's walking.  In fact, it's right before the Riviera, which is pretty far down.\n\nThat being said, the food was decent.  Between 3 of us, we ordered the Maserati omelet, waffle combo, and Munch's breakfast (a special).  All were pretty good, but a bit overpriced in my opinion.  Portions were huge.  The service was ok, a bit lackluster.  Our waitress was nice enough though.  I guess I'd come here if I was close but if you're not staying at the Riviera, I wouldn't make an extra trip to come here."

S'This review is about Fireside Lounge, NOT the Peppermill restaurant.\n\nThe staff: Our waitress was friendly.  It seemed like we bothered her a bit at first because we kept moving around, but she warmed up to us in the end.  One of my friends knew the manager so she came by and helped us out too.  We didn\'t wait too long for anything, and we had an endless supply of beer nuts.  Everyone seemed pretty chill.  No need to impress or go above and beyond; just very casual and relaxed.  All the waitresses wore long "gowns-could-be-a-homecoming-dress".  I thought it was a nice touch.  I mean, why not right?\n\nThe goods:  I\'m not a heavy drinker, I just had a couple beers.  There was a complaint that the beers weren\'t cold so the manager put some on ice for us before she brought them out.  I had a sip of my friend\'s margarita on the rocks and that was pretty tasty.  Another friend ordered nachos.  They weren\'t bad.  It was really dark, but I\'m almost positive there was mozzarella cheese on them.  Different, but not bad.  I don\'t think many people come for the food, and if you do, you\'ll  probably be disappointed.  \n\nThe atmosphere: This is why Fireside has a reputation.  Firepit surrounded by water, bubbled by jets.  It\'s like Satan\'s jacuzzi.  We sat in the pit for a little bit, but there were quite a few of us so we ended up moving to a different booth.  The booths are comfortable, squishy, and I liked the throw pillows.  Lots of "greenery", helps make some of the booths more private.  I requested that we stay in a booth that was somewhat well lit and very public, Lord knows what happens in those private booths.  This is a pretty cool place, not pretentious at all.  We ended up swapping stories of previous visits to Fireside.  If you\'re skittish or conservative, I would recommend coming early in the evening or not at all.  This place gets pretty diverting in the late hours.  The pimps and their girls will come in and have their cocktails, and if you\'re lucky, there\'ll be a mild drug exchange going on in a booth next to you.  A lot of the transvestites frequent this joint too...I think because the lighting is almost nonexistent (jk).  They\'re really friendly, so be prepared to converse with strangers.  Every now and again some famous someone or other will drop in too.  Again, probably because of the lack of lighting, so they can enjoy some privacy.  There are TVs everywhere and we enjoyed the old-school to not so old-school music they played.  The Beach Boys are getting ollllllllllld, but still so lovable.  I think this is a place for an older crowd, but a fresh pup with an open mind could probably really enjoy it.\n\nWe went for my going away party and I\'m not disappointed.  We had a good time and we didn\'t bother anyone with our volume.  I would recommend this place for a casual get-together, but not if you\'re looking for a sit down dinner.  If you just want a place to chill, relax and shoot the shit, Fireside Lounge is a good spot.  Just be aware of your location and understand that anything can happen.  I mean seriously, it\'s Vegas.'

The sugar is even multicolored and the coffee cups are the size of a small thermos. Breakfast is huge too. We got one of the specials with spanish sausage, onions, peppers cooked with hashbrowns and fresh eggs and cheese. Yummy! The bar has this absolutely cool fire place/water pool thing you have to check out. Oh, and of course you can get a bloody mary or strawberry daquiri if your inclined.

S'I hate to admit I first came to this place because of "Anthony Bourdain no reservations." For years I\'ve driven by this place thinking that it looks like a Vegas rendition of a Denny\'s. When you first walk in, the Vegas Denny\'s theme still holds true with one small exception. You will notice a double glass door in the back left corner that leads to the Peppermill\'s Fireside Lounge. The 5 stars is solely for the Fireside Lounge and not the Restaurant. \nYou instantly enter into a late 60\'s early 70\'s themed lounge that relaxes and surprises in the same breath. The decor looks like they actually had well kept furniture from the 70\'s imported through some kind of time portal and not the new furniture that is meant to look retro. I ordered the scorpion (Giant volleyball sized drink) because I saw Bourdain order it himself and our group loved it. We (my wife and myself) got it blended with the ice cream and the couple we were with got it on the rocks. Both are very tasty but I\'d have to go with ice cream variety. We order the Peppermill sampler which had cheese sticks, chicken fingers, shrimp, and bruschetta to name a few. It served its purpose and tasted good but nothing too standout about it. \nThe service was on spot and great!! Peppermill\'s Fireside Lounge is a must stop if you\'re in the Vegas area. Great for pre/post parties or even being the main attraction. \nHere\'s my advice to the Peppermill owners- Keep up the great job and don\'t change a thing!!!'

It has a retro-look with neon lighting and faux cherry blossoms (if you ever go, you'll know what I mean).\n\nA bit of advice if you intend to eat at Peppermill... come hungry.  It's fairly expensive for a diner-like restaurant, but it makes up for it in its ridiculously huge portions for most of its dishes.  I have never seen so many people have to request take-out boxes before.\n\nI ordered a philly cheesesteak (since I wasn't actually all that hungry), which was good, but nothing too special.  My parents ordered a beef kabob (which was pretty tasty) and a walnut creek salad (which had a pesto dressing that just didn't agree with me)."

S'I really wanted to love this place after seeing all of the glowing reviews, but what I found on a Saturday morning was a generic middle American coffee shop.  Certainly not a bad breakfast option, but not worth a long walk from your hotel, either (if you are at Riviera or Circus Circus, though, check it out). Omelets are huge but filled with too much cheap American cheese, hash browns were rather hard and unappetizing. Maybe I caught them on a bad day...\n\nI liked the blue and purple lighting and the 70\'s-style round booths. Waitresses wore "Hawaiian truck stop" floral print dresses and were exceptionally nice and attentive. Much better service than the average 24-hour hotel restaurant.\n\nCan\'t comment on the dinner menu or late night experience - I\'ll have to go back and try it.

Otherwise, the steak and eggs were good, as were the pancakes.  Another goodie was the Bloody Mary that was brought out by the drink hostess in a long black evening dress @ 10AM.  FUN!\n\nAll in all a fun experience!"

S"This is an interesting place. Most of it is a large, eclectically decorated diner and there is also a decent sized lounge in the back. There is a large parking lot out front and even more space out back. This place gets crazy busy so plan ahead. There is a ton of seating, and they turn tables fairly quickly but there is often still a wait. If you come during any peak meal hours be prepared to wait.\n\nThe dining area is a series of large booths. There are neon lights all over and a mirrored tile ceiling, much like a disco ball. There are also a ton of plants scattered through out the diner.\n\nI ordered the Joe's San Francisco Special without spinach. It is a combination of scrambled eggs, pork sausage, ground beef and onion served on a bed of crispy hash browns with a cheese sauce. As with all of their meals you get a large portion. You will not leave hungry. The flavors all combined nicely as did the textures. I was quite happy with my choice.\n\nOverall the service was good, the food was good, the portions are larger and it is affordable. The only issue is the crowds. It is quite popular, but also worth it."

You won't leave hungry if you order food. And if you don't- you won't be dissapointed with the eye candy or the drinks. It's 24 hrs after all and Vegas is a 24 hr city...so at some point you should end up here. Good spot for pictures..."

S"Pro: Anna in the Fireside Lounge, the fire pit in the fireside lounge, cool rose decor in the fireside lounge, did i mention Anna? \n\nCon: Slightly over price food in the Peppermill Restaurant, crazy lights in the Peppermill, so so food. \n\nWent to the Peppermill due to overwhelming good personal recommendations and of course Hazel's review. Not to mention the Rose Bowl was going and we needed a place with big screen to the watch the game. \n\nSo, Peppermill it is and thank you god for that place. \n\nThe hostess told us that the Lounge only have starters, so we planned on drinking and watching for a bit with a sampler, then head back to the restaurant for food during half time. \n\nWe walked into a rose vine covered Lounge with the bar on the right and watery fire pits on the left, flat screen and semi circle couches are all over the place. The lounge server was Anna, a dark hair Romanian beauty that looks like a cross of Rachel McAdams and Lauren Graham but hotter, younger, with longer legs. Yes, I know I shouldn't be reviewing this place based on her, but it is that golden sunset at your Malibu mansion that sets your place apart to other locations. \n\nThe food and drinks were a flowing, everything worked out with pretty good service. Then we left at half time for food, which just was a bit overpriced but it is very good. Service was prompt and Silviya's suggestion on the omelet are a great one. Milk shake and carrot cake were pretty right on the spot. \n\nOverall, if you are in Vegas, go see Anna in the Lounge for business meeting or to chill with friends. Food, you can save more money going to somewhere else, but probably not as good."

I love the whole cheesy, neon night club atmosphere thing going on, I love the big over portioned drinks as well as food and I love the fact that it brings back so many fond memories of the days in Vegas and also memories of other Peppermills I have visited over the years.\n\nI came here recently for breakfast on my little Vegas getaway and immediately felt a comforting sensation as I entered in through the doors. I was immediate greeted by an exceptionally friendly hostess and seated promptly.\n\nI ordered a sausage, Swiss cheese and onion omelet, which came with has browns and a blueberry muffin.\n\nAs always, the peppermill way, my omelet was GYNORMOUSE and mouthwatering delicious and even the hash browns were quite tasty especially considering the fact that I'm not into hash browns.\n\nThe bar area is fantabulous!!! Dark secluded and intimate with a big fiery pit centered in the middle surrounded by an engaging lounge couch area. It  definitely is something worth checking out!

S'Blah ... it is a Denny\'s with even bigger portions. Meaning you pay $13 for a pancake and you get a really big pancake. The food in general is no better than any other fast casual breakfast place just bigger portions. Our server, Cheyanne, we think forgot our order because when she started serving people around us, who sat down 45 minutes after our party of 6, she said the delay was "making a grilled cheese". Funny, the grilled cheese came out first! She also brought toast to one diner 30 minutes before their eggs arrived. When they asked for "hot toast" for their meal she seemed a little put out. BUT, the Peppermill is an establishment and part of the Vegas experience. Just don\'t think you are going to get anything special except for your Bloody Mary served by a woman in an evening gown.'

S'I\'ve been here several times and each time it seems like it gets better. Sure it\'s a great place to chill and relax by the fireplace to grab a drink and relax. But what keeps me coming back is the classic greasy american diner grub in a only in Vegas atmosphere! i.e. bright tacky florescent lighting, flamingos, and the familiar pink Vegas lighting glow! \n\nI usually stick with the classic diner grub, i.e. burgers, sandwiches, and egg dishes. Portions are decent, flavor is what you\'d expect from this type of place. The Pastrami is very nicely done! The rings and fries are no joke either! Food is way better than a large portion of the 24/7 cafes in most of the casinos. \n\nThe service is very friendly and professional! I usually ask what they would recommend, the responses have always been pretty good! At least the servers know which of  their food taste good!  \n\nDrinks are served by ladies in an evening dress! With those coming out of the "Fireplace" bar! Usually a pretty funny scene with all the drunks coming in and out of the bar area!  Classic!\n\nEat, Drink, and be Merry!'

There is a photographer that comes around to the tables and you get a postcard of the photo at the end of your meal (you also have the option of purchasing a larger,  cardboard framed version).  There's rainbow sugar on the table. \n\nI have been to the Peppermill several times.  I started just going to the Fireside Lounge,  but on the last few trips,  I've eaten at the diner too.  The food is really good and very reasonably priced for the Las Vegas Strip.  Last time I was there, I had a spinach omelete,  which was giant and delicious.  The pancakes and hashbrowns were also tasty. \n\nThe Peppermill is a must see when you are in Vegas. The Fireside Lounge next door is beyond kitschy and has all kinds of tropical drinks,  even some non-alcoholic ones. They serve honey roasted peanuts and play ridiculous music videos.  If there's a wait for a table at the diner,  take a seat at the bar and wait while sipping a Zombie or virgin Pina Colada."

S'Well worth it!\n\nWhen we called to make reservations for our large group (10+) for lunch on Father\'s Day the receptionist let us know that even though they Didn\'t do reservations, you could still call ahead and get put on the waiting list before you arrived.\n\nThe wait was supposed to be 30 minutes, so we called ahead about 30 minutes before we were to arrive. But it took an Additional 30 minutes for them to ready our tables we we got there. Upon asking about the delay about 15 minutes in, they let us know that 1 table had been cleared but they were waiting on a second due to our group size. Understandable.\n\nHowever, this wasn\'t wasted time since we all crowded into their beautiful Fireside Lounge for drinks.\n\nWhat to choose?\n\nAfter reading fellow Yelper reviews, I was focused on trying two things:\n1. The Scorpion 2. The Chicken Fried Steak\n\nThe Scorpion was a massive reddish-orange-pink monster. It created an instant buzz: What the heck is that? Can I try that? The double-length foursome of straws were like something out of "A Christmas Story." All I could hear repeated in the back of my head was "You\'re gonna poke your eye out!" Instant Photo Opportunity. Being Las Vegas we were able to transport it (slowly) from the Fireside Lounge to the Restaurant area for our meal.\n\nGood sweet Mai Tai flavor. You couldn\'t taste the alcohol.\n\nP.S. The server let us know that you can keep the Scorpion\'s cup (Known as a "Fishbowl") as a memento for an additional five dollars.\n\nTime to do some eating!\n\nPortions were very large. Great for sharing.\n\nThe Southern Chicken-Fried Steak was amazing. Well-breaded. So flavorful. Meaty. Crispy. The kind of food you add to your "crave" list. 5/5\n\nThe over-easy eggs were fluffy and delightful. 4/5\n\nThe hash browns were a disappointment. Kind of soft and mushy. Next time (and there will DEFINITELY be a next time) I will have to ask for them extra-crispy. 2/5\n\nThe "Can I try a bite of that? Oooh Yum!" List: Their Eggs Benedict 4/5 and also their Pancakes 4/5. I probably would have asked for more samples if I wasn\'t so happily focused on my Chicken-Fried Steak.\n\nKind of difficult to get a server since it was so crazy-busy for the holiday. Servers were very nice and attentive once you flagged one down.\n\nThis is now one of my must-eat Las Vegas destinations. Yum.\n\nSincerely, Michael'

S'Usually a 24 hour restaurant, I usually think of Denny\'s. Mainly a little less then average place, just to have something to eat and not much to really look at, except the other booth of people around you. But Peppermill, proved me wrong about 24 hour restaurants, and looks more then an average place. Now this was an ideal 24 hour restaurants, that I wish it could take over Denny\'s. Then I would be coming there all the time. \n\nLocated next to Riveria, its a very colorful restaurant on the strip. Of course I had my doubts about going here, but glad my wife twisted my arm and go. Outside, it may look a bit unsure on cause its close to downtown. But despite the fancy looks that you can see on the outside, inside, is a whole different story. The seating is not like no other picnic table booth, its basically a curved booth with nice, colorful seating. You don\'t have to worry about being smooshed against the wall anymore. Each booth is like curved like the letter "C", all over the restaurant. It has very nice lighting, and very wonderful arrangements, like your in the rainforest. Not like Rainforest Cafe, but a bit less elaborate then Rainforest Cafe. \n\nThe staff was wonderful, we were seated right away, we were served drinks, once we were seated. Our waitress was very nice as well. They all wore colorful uniforms and made the place interesting. She always made sure that we were okay. \n\nLooking over the menu, the pricing was a bit more then I expected. But once I got my food, I can see why. The food was in big portions. I ordered the New York Steak, and ordered it well done. I was amazed that it came out well done. I mean, no pink what so ever on that meat. Usually when I order steak, it doesn\'t seem well done, but this time around, it was. Made me think about next time I come here, I should order medium. I don\'t mind pink, but I thought like any other place I had a well done steak, it had little pink. But I really did enjoy my New York steak. It did come with a salad, and it came big. Also came with Onion rings that were big. Mainly everything was big, even my wife\'s coffee cup was big. As much as I wanted to try to finish it, I couldn\'t. I came so close though. Finish the salad, the steak, but threw in the towel with 3 onion rings left. \n\nIf your looking for a place to eat in the middle of the night. Peppermill will surely not disappoint. The pricing may be more then usual, but its well worth the price, especially when everything comes at you in big portions. Very well recommended 24 hour restaurant.'

It was not on the strip, so I was a little unsure about heading there at first, but it is more than worth it. We were there for breakfast and the omelets were huge! The menu is pretty extensive, mostly basic dinner food, but something for everyone. I am a lover of breakfast to begin with, but I was over the moon about this place. Did I mention their sugar is colored? At first glance, it almost looks like glitter! LOVE! The service was quick and everyone was friendly. The waitresses wear uniforms that go along with the ambiance of the place: Vegas meets townie dinner meets flamingos...very neat little place that I would have never found if it weren't for a friend who visits her family.

With everything stated above, I could give the Peppermill 4 stars, HOWEVER....\n\nThe server took FOREVER!!!  We were there for dinner and, although seated immediately, were there for nearly two hours.  The server grabbed a box for me to take the remainder of my food home in, but didn't think to grab the check at the same time?  After that it took forever to flag her down... and even after she picked up the check it took her ages to swipe the credit card.\n\nAlthough I enjoyed the food, the service absolutely killed it for me.

I guess we were making it a cheesy old Vegas kind of night.  \n\nWeird mix in that the lounge feels like it used to be a strip club, while the diner looked slightly nicer than your typical Denny's.  At least the 2 are separated by a glass door.  The couches in the lounge are cool and it one of those places were you could relax with your girl around the faux fire for a couple hours with drinks and just veg out.

S'Yelp states "Vegetarians go nuts for this place!" but as a longtime vegetarian that finally made it to The Peppermill for lunch last Friday, I found that the menu did NOT offer many vegetarian choices at all.\n\nMany places these days that have a selection of different types of burgers will also have a veggie-burger option, yet Peppermill does not.   Likewise, looking through the rest of the menu, there really weren\'t many options unless I wanted breakfast.\n\nI ended up ordering nachos.  They were great, but not exactly what I\'d want as my sole item for lunch.\n\nOur waitress was OK, but seemed annoyed or distracted each time she stopped by our table.\n\n  So even though the Peppermill\'s menu doesn\'t thrill me, I actually like the place & will be back.  Why?   I really liked the interior design and atmosphere, and that the place is open 24/7.  Even at Noon on a Friday, the people-watching was fantastic, and I expect it\'s even more of a human zoo late at night/early in the morning, most of the clientele appearing to be locals.\n\nI\'ll be back, but due to their limited vegetarian options, I either need to be hungry for breakfast, or not very hungry at all.  I won\'t go between midnight & 8AM until I\'m current on all my vaccinations...'

Who knew you could do so much with so little floral patterned polyester? \n\nThe food is decent and the portions are HUGE. We made the mistake of going when we first got to Vegas. This place would be the perfect stop after a night of heavy drinking. The food is good enough and the value is there. \n\nThe people watching is utterly top notch. It's worth the trip as long as you're prepared for a trip to Tackyland."

S"I've been here twice on two separate Vegas trips. For the first, I was hungover and looking for something heavy and tasty to calm my stomache, and for the second I was completely blitzed and practically falling asleep at the table. \n\nBoth times, Peppermill gave me exactly what I needed: a giant cup of coffee, a huge plate of diner-style food, and a fun environment to eat in. The food wasn't stellar, nor was it bad. It just hit the spot both times.\n\nThis place may not be getting Michelin stars anytime soon, but it sure beats the hell out of eating watery eggs at Denny's at 4am."

S'I went back to Peppermill and took my cousin there around 9am.  We went there for breakfast and I had pancake combo (3 pancakes, 2 sausages, 2 bacons, and eggs). Boy, the pancake was huge and the whole meal was delicious.  The photographer comes around and take photos for free.  The 2 frames and photos are $20.00 which is a great deal.  By the time we finished there was a long line of people waiting for a table. I love this place.'

S"When I asked the driver to take us to a place near the LV Convention Center for breakfast, I naturally assumed he'd drop us off at the nearest Denny's. Instead, he brought us to Peppermill, a throwback diner with a strip club feel. When we walked in, I couldn't decide if I was looking at a scene from National Lampoon's Vegas Vacation or a Tarantino film.\n\nThe d\xc3\xa9cor was straight from the 70s with fake hanging plants and booths wrapped in hot pink and blue neon lights (hence the strip club feel).  The patrons were equally colorful on a weekday morning.\n\nThe food was good old Americana. Huge portions and decent prices. $11.50 for 3 eggs, 3 big sausage links, really crispy tasty hash browns, and toast. Coffee mugs were latte size, so you didn't have to wait around for a refill (a plus if you're a caffeine addict like me) which was good because although the server was friendly, she rarely stopped to check on us. Our table was the only table that didn't have regular sugar packets, which we didn't notice that until AFTER we used what we assumed was sugar from the container on the table. It was sugary (red, white, blue pellets) and left a candy like floaties in my coffee. I kept waiting for the hallucinations to start, but ultimately no harm done. \n\nOverall, it's nothing spectacular, but I love finding new spots and taking in the local color (neon and all). Worth a stop if you're hungry and  on that end of the strip."

S"If this review were based on the food quality alone, I would give The Peppermill three stars.  It's typical diner fare.  \n\nBut the venue is extremely cool, and rates an extra star.\n\nIf you happen to be Andre the Giant or a member of the I.F.O.C.E, you'll be able to eat everything on your plate.  Otherwise, I'm not liking your chances.  In other words, the portion sizes are quite large.  I ordered the chorizo and eggs and a Miller Lite(!)...was able to muscle my way through them, but barely touched the accompanying refried beans.  Very tasty.\n\nI sat at the counter, so I was able to see a lot of entrees come off the line and hear the waitresses complain about each other.  Riveting.\nThe waffle would feed a family of four, I swear.\n\nThe Peppermill is just a diner with a lot of flair.  I'll return on my next visit to LV.  You should too!\n\n\nNOTE:  I.F.O.C.E. = International Federation of Competitive Eating"

Crazy colors and wait staff dressed in old school uniforms, it's definitely a place to check out at least once if you're in Vegas.  This place does an all day breakfast, and their portions are serious.  The ham steak is literally the size of a large dinner plate, and they grill it so that it gets some great flavor!  Their hash browns are great too, and they use real potatoes!  And I like that they use shredded potatoes that they griddle the heck out of, because I like my hash browns crispy.  And for those that want/need a drink in the morning, maybe to recover from the night before, they have a full bar from the lounge next door that you can order from.  Overall, fun place to go, whether for food, drinks, or just the atmosphere."

Not sure if they were worth $10, considering you don't get much. After we got our drinks we waited for a table for about 30 minutes. Once we sat down we were greeted by our waitress, who started off very attentive and then soon disappeared. until our check was delivered. I ordered the eggs benedict which were very mediocre.

There's a photographer who goes around and takes pictures. But seriously, I'm not coming here for the decor at 3am; I'm coming because I need some food after a night out.  \n\nThe food is extremely mediocre; I'd even say that it's below average in quality.  The portions are large however, but who cares how much you get when you can't eat something because it just doesn't taste good?\n\nI understand that this place isn't gourmet, but I definitely expect food that's at least on par with the average diner.

So here's my advice, skip the appetizer and split one of their creatively delicious milk shakes.

S"(Review is for milkshakes only) came here because I've heard a lot about the milkshakes, after looking at the menus in the bar/lounge area we noticed the shakes weren't listed on there, we had to grab the hostess (who was facing the dining room and talking to the other servers) and ask if we can see a full menu.  After agreeing we wanted to try some shakes we asked the hostess if we had to order in the dining room or if we could go to lounge area, she said we can sit at the bar, order to go or order at the bar.  We sat in the lounge area and noticed we had to go back to the hostess stand to get a full menu.  The hostess was still facing the restaraunt talking to the servers so I just went to her stand and grabbed the menu myself.  By this point I was a little irritated but still wanted a milkshake.  We ordered the Fat Boy and the Vegan Maple Pecan, it took a while for 2 shakes but after trying it, it was worth the wait.  A few minutes later a runner came out and brought the leftover vegan maple shake, we were confused since we had our entire order, when we looked in what we thought was the vegan shake, it was actually a vanilla shake.  So pretty much they delivered the extra/leftover vanilla shake to a vegan...who drank it not realizing it was non vegan\n=(\nI understand there's a chance of getting non-vegan items at a Restaraunt that's not completely vegan but the entire experience was not worth it.  Good shakes though."

Way too thick (both in size and texture). Maybe it's because I didn't get a million toppings on my burger that there was too much bread but I'm generally pretty simple with my burger order.\n\nFries were pretty good (ordered the shoestring).\n\nHighlight of the meal was the milkshake.

S"So I was trying to be productive tonight, but yet again technology is here to foil my plans. \n\nI was staying at the Cosmopolitan with some friends and we were hungry after lazing by the pool. Yelp pointed us to this scrumptious looking restaurant and once again, it did not disappoint. \n\nWe made reservations on opentable, but they were not needed since it was not busy. After looking at the menu, we went with the Rising Sun and Gold Standard, which seem to be their best burgers according to Yelp reviews. The Yelp reviews also talk about how their milkshakes are excellent, and everyone who was eating seemed to have one of these huge milkshakes. One look at my lactard body started to rebel, so I managed to sum up some willpower and abstain from enjoying one. \n\nSoon after ordering, our appetizers were delicious and made me pretty excited for the rest of our meal. Delicious ahi tuna, rich and creamy lobster macaroni and cheese...I could have stopped there and been happy with my meal. \n\nOur burgers came and although both were pretty good, I liked the Gold Standard better than the Rising Sun. The Rising Sun is covered in this sweet glaze that was okay, but I was really looking for something savory. I'm sure if we didn't have all of the other food, I would have eaten that burger without complaint. \n\nAnother plus is that we asked for our burgers medium-rare and they came medium-rare. Scrumptious! \n\nA third plus is that the table next to us heard me griping to the heavens about paying for wi-fi, so they generously gave me their super secret password to get on. Yay!\n\nA fourth plus was that Kevin Hart was eating at the same time as us, and our server encouraged us to go say hi and take a picture. I had a sudden bout of awkwardness, which tends to happen when I become uncertain. So, I froze awkwardly, stalked around his table like some crazy person, then lost my nerve and fled the scene. \n\nLet's work on that self-confidence, shall we?"

I bookmarked this place before my last Vegas trip because I'm a huge sucker for gourmet burgers and I really wanted to try this place. The opportunity finally came, so I came here for dinner.\n\nNot everyone in our group wanted burgers, so we got our food to go. You order and wait at the bar for to-go orders. After much contemplation, I decided to go with The Rising Sun (with shoestring fries) because there were a lot of good reviews for it and it was a unique combination of ingredients for a burger. Well, it was a good choice! It certainly was a unique combo of flavors, and it worked. I don't usually go for the Asian-themed item in a menu, but being a burger, it ended up being a good fusion item. The fries were alright. Not the best I've had.\n\nI would definitely come here again to try another one of their many unique offerings."

I also experienced the fried pickles (a MUST have), country fried bacon and the pork buns. Bring friends, split the appetizers and spring for the burger. You won't regret it. \n\nFinish things off with one of their amazing shakes - I had the Tira Misu, and I will absolutely be back for another. \n\nThe staff are uber friendly and definitely knowledgeable. The prices aren't In N Out Burger, but they aren't Strip Steak, either. Right in the middle where they should be.

They serve gourmet burgers and spiked milkshakes.  Is there anything you can't get drunk on in Vegas?  The burgers are pretty damn good, but it was really only a better version of Red Robin, with an upgraded (better looking) wait staff.  The essential complement to burgers - the fries - were a disappointment.  They seemed overcooked.\n\nService was extremely slow, even though there were plenty of empty tables, but our waitress kept us updated.  I had nearly finished my shake by then.  \n\n3 stars for now.

S"no wait for a table! hoooray!! the korean bull-gogi burger was pretty damn tasty! the bff and i split this burger and the waitress was kind enough to bring an extra plate without us even asking for one. we requested the burger be cooked medium and that's exactly what we got. the over easy egg was fried to perfection. as for the kimchee slaw... it wasn't spicy enough! maybe because the kalbi glaze overpowered the spices. the shoestring fries were sooooo yummy!!! all in all, we were both stuffed. thank goodness we didn't each order a dish. i'd def come back to try the other items on the menu."

S'This place did not live up to expectations.  We browsed yelp reviews and looked through the menu prior to getting here, and were really excited to try the selection, but most of us left disappointed.  Luckily, I think I got the best burger of the bunch (The Rising Sun Burger!).\n\nThe Rising Sun Burger is an Asian-inspired burger so I loved the sweet, salty flavors.  The fried avocado and addition of tempura added a wonderful element to it.  I also added an additional egg on mine.  However, I think the key to a GREAT burger is the meat patty, and this is where Holsteins fell short with ALL our burgers.  Mine "supposedly" had a kobe beef patty, but I would\'ve never known the difference because in-n-out serves a better patty.  They asked us how we wanted our patties cooked, and all of us went with medium-rare, but they were all overcooked.  Our patties tasted dry and flavorless.\n\nOur group shared two appetizers - the Lobster Mac \'n Cheese and the Wings.  Both were mediocre.  The mac \'n cheese was runny, there was barely any lobster in it, and the portion was tiny.  Not worth the high price tag.  The wings were your standard wings - I think Wingstop wings are just as good.\n\nAlthough I didn\'t order one, my friends said the alcoholic shakes didn\'t even taste like there were any alcohol in them.  They might as well have ordered regular non-alcoholic shakes elsewhere for a fraction of the cost.\n\nCool concept, but execution fell short.'

We left Holsteins far too full - fat and happy for sure.\nEl Machete was amazing, spicy, but not too spicy cooked perfectly medium. Juicy, big, heaven to eat. I want another! I was so wrapped up in my burger I don't even remember what Jeff had, but he devoured his just as quickly as I ate mine. We have already agreed another trip needs to be made back to Vegas just so we can eat at Holsteins.

It was perfectly cooked and the beef tasted like beef, sounds stupid but its not that common. I mean when you order a burger it should taste like beef not .85 cent teriyaki sauce or sweet baby rays BBQ sauce but I digress. The bun was delicious and the fries were excellent, I went with the steak cut. The decor in the restaurant was very hip, kinda Japanese anime-esque. The service was very good and friendly.'

We were drawn in because it was right across from Marquee and had a huge pink cow. What's not to love?!? \n\nThe food was good. I had the grilled marinated chicken breast, smoked bacon, provolone cheese, pesto aioli, arugula, and tomato on a Foccacia Roll. It was delicious, really  hit the spot!

S"5 stars for the food, minus 1 star for the service. \n\nMy fellow Yelpers, you did not disappoint. My friend and I came here after reading reviews on Yelp. We always like to try new things, so this was a perfect opportunity. \n\nI had the Billionaire Burger, and yes, it is DEFINITELY worth the $28!! After California banned foie gras, I was heart broken. I didn't know when I will be able to eat it again, so when I saw the Billionaire Burger on the menu, I had to get it!\n\nThis burger is made with kobe beef, FOIE GRAS, port onion marmalade, frisee, and truffle mayo. This burger is packed with a punch of flavor and textures that all mesh so well together. I usually get cheese on my burgers, but I opted out this time since there's so many flavors going on already. If you absolutely need some cheese, I'd probably recommend a mild cheese like provolone or gruyere. \n\nWhen the burger was set down in front of me, my jaw just about dropped to the floor. There was a HUGE piece of grilled foie gras on my burger. I was expecting small pieces or even just a pate version, but no, I was wrong. The foie gras was so creamy and the truffle mayo was so earthy and packed a punch. There was small pieces of truffle in the mayo! You definitely get the bang for your buck here. The burger came with a choice of shoestring fries (which I recommend since they are so crunchy) or steak fries. \n\nAnother tip. If you check in with Foursquare, you get a free house draft beer or margarita. I don't know how long this offer lasts, but give it a try. \n\nFor the service, it was just non existent. Our server took so long to take our orders. We sat at the table for about 10 min after she took our order to get our drinks. I think she just wasn't in the mood to be at work, but still, you can't let the customers know that. \n\nAll in all, yes, I definitely felt like a Billionaire eating that burger, and that burger was probably the best fancy burger I had in my life! I can't wait til I go to Vegas again."

S"My friends and I were getting ready to head over to Marquee in the Cosmopolitan, but had to stop somewhere to get our grub on before we get our freak on. We walked by Holsteins and decided to pop in for some burgers and fries.\n\nThe ambiance was nice and the DJ was spinning some awesome music. We were quickly seated and the waiter took our order. My sister and I settled on the Hen House (has bacon and a fried egg, bam!) while the others got Korean Bull'Gogi (fried egg and lots of kimchi) and The Rising Sun (teriyaki). The waiter was super patient and helpful with us when we tried to decided and even allowed for us to cut burgers in half to share. If you decide for smaller portions, they even have sliders which is a great option for those who wanna keep it light before dancing.\n\nThe burgers came out with either shoestring or steakcut fries and both were delicious. I think I may have been a fan of the shoestring though as it had a great crisp to it while steakcut had a great potato-y inside. The burgers were cooked exactly how we we wanted (in my case it was medium) and was a big-ass burger. I'm glad I opted to share mine with someone because I wouldn't have been able to finish it on my own. \n\nI'd definitely come here in the future to eat if I'm headed to the club since it's right across from Holsteins but I gotta go back next time to try their shakes! They looked great, but something about all that milk and alcohol didn't mix for me, so I decided against it this time around. All in all, I much prefer this joint compared to Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay."

Both times I tried the classic burger though; since it really doesn't come with many toppings, you have to serve excellent beef and I didn't think it was fantastic. I am not a fan of shakes, boozy or otherwise, but you can tell that it is not from a miz and they make them on the spot. \n\nThe vibe is fun, trendy and youthful, many people have dinner here before heading over to Marquee."

I've tried half the burgers on the list, and they have all been great, although the million dollar burger was the least impressionable and totally not worth it. When in doubt, keep it simple and get the nom nom or get the flavorful rising sun with a side salad or the sweet potato fries. Also, try the lobster mac and cheese! It comes with lobster chunks and sprinkled with bread crumbs. You're tongue an stomach will be please, and even as a midnight snack or leftovers, it will still taste good!"

I tried the Hen House burger, with bacon and a fried egg on it and it was very tasty, that's for sure. I loved the thin-cut french fries and could easily have eaten two servings (probably did anyway). SO, then I tried the Campfire Smores milkshake. HOLY CRAP. Then I tried another milkshake at the table, the Cereal Bowl, with Cap N' Crunch and Fruity Pebbles, which wasn't as good as the smores one, but I'm sure I could have downed about 4 of them in a sitting. Did I mention that the milkshakes have BOOZE in them? Ahhhh, yeah.....\nAnyway, I tried 2 of the specialty bloody Mary martinis; the Spicy one was served with a poached shrimp that was as big as Paul Bunyon's thumb, I swear. But the kicker drink was the Savory bloody Mary martini, with BEEF BRISKET INFUSED VODKA and a skewer that had 3 large chunks of perfectly cooked filet mignon- SO yum. Who thinks this stuff up? Brisket-infused vodka? How the hell would a person even make that? \nTry this place out, you won't regret it."

I got there right when they opened so it was easy to get a table. I ordered onion rings as an app....they were very good, but waaaay to much for one person. I asked them if they could make me a kobe beef burger done up as The Classic and they were happy to comply. They also brought some popcorn to my table. I didn't like it, but it was free so who cares. The burger was delicious, fries were good, and I also enjoyed the onion rings. Nothing to complain about, except it's probably a little pricey for my taste.

Salt and Vinegar Popcorn was amazing. Thank God the first tin was free.\n- BamBOOZEled Shakes: Shakes with Booze in them :]. I don\'t remember the names of them, but I really enjoyed the one with the Cereal in it. Sweet, Creamy, and still had the alcohol taste to it.\n- BURGERS, OMG SUPER GOOD. My friends NOMed on the El Machete (they suggest you add an Egg in it too!). It has a good kick to it. I had the Rising Sun, and the Avocado Tempura was the part that simply made it spectacular. Shredded Fried Yam and Teriyaki Sauce were a great touch to make it look super lovely.\n- Fries: NOOOOO This was a major downfall. Were pretty bland and tasteless. Wish they had more seasoning or something to it!\n\nService: Our table liked our waitress. One guy at our table was pretty much "Well she\'s for sure getting a 20% tip at least". She was super friendly, threw in some cool jokes, got us some more free popcorn, helped us take a picture, and all with a genuine smile. Definitely the made the night a whole lot better. She was a bit busy, but she came by exactly when we needed it.\n\nAtmosphere: This place has a strange, but great mix of cuteness and casualness. The cartoonish artwork creates a light and whimsical setting, but the lighting and decor definitely bump this place towards a lounge sort of feel. Our group enjoyed it and it fit perfectly into the Vegas atmosphere.\n\nPrice: I\'m not complaining to be honest, since I feel like I got what I paid for. Though numerically I spent around $30-$40 (For a shake, and burger) it seemed well worth it to me.\n\nOverall Opinion: There were a few things that just dropped this place from a 5. Lack of solid fries, a tinnnnnny bit pricey on the shakes, and just that ounce of "THIS THING IS SOMETHING EVERYONE SHOULD TRY" was missing.\nHowever despite that, this place clearly has a great variety on their menu, solid use of organic and high grade ingredients, and a unique atmosphere for the hip and casual crowds.

S'Tasty, overpriced, terrible service. Welcome to Las Vegas!\n\nThis place typifies the Las Vegas burger, minus the In-and-Out down the street (which we traveled to twice, didn\'t come back to Holsteins).\n\nI get it, arugula is fancy, it\'s not worth a $15 burger though. Service was terrible, waited about 20 minutes for a table, being the first party on a non-existent, no-names last. Then, hostess: "oh, someone just took that table that opened up. Sorry!" ... wait, what exactly is your job here? Anyhow... sat at the bar due to hungry, takes forever to get anything ordered, and bartender literally stops attending to respond to someone else\'s commentary on something or other. Worthless service.\n\nI dunno. I mean. Burgers people. Not $20, not $30. You\'ll probably spend like $50 for 2 burgers and a beer. I can\'t do it. I\'m in the wrong city. But, In-and-Out is down the street! Under $10 for two to eat, and way better service than Holsteins. Fail.\n\nGood food though.\n\nThanks for listening!'

I often wish that I had starved myself a little more before coming so that I could eat more. It's that good.\n\nLet's start with their bam-boozled shakes. Shakes, yum. Add alcohol? Uh yes please. I've had the frozen grasshopper (peppermint, chocolate, creme de menthe, and chocolate vodka) the birthday cake (I think this might be new since I don't see it on their online menu. Think sprinkles, and bits of cake), and the drunken monkey (reese's, banana, malt, and frangelico). All amazing.\n\nAs for their food, I love their apps. Hello fried cheese curds, truffle lobster mac and cheese, and fried pickles served with fried caper berries, olives, and salami. Though I think their menu has changed. I got the fried pickles again this weekend and there were no other sides to the dish. I was a little sad about it.\n\nOkay, now for the main course. The burgers. I'm already drooling... The Rising Sun burger is still one of my favorites. Kobe beef with a teriyaki glaze, crispy yam, spicy mayo and tempura avocado. Wow. No really, wow. The Hen House burger? Delicious but nothing super fancy. The Korean Bull'gogi burger is yum. I'm a sucker for a fried egg and kimchi and this burger has both as well as chili mayo. And last but not least (for the beef burgers anyway), the Gold Standard burger. Beef sirloin burger with smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic chive aioli. You can't be serious.\n\nDon't worry vegan/vegetarians, there's something for you too. They have a vegan burger which actually sounds pretty tasty and There is a wonderful salmon burger called Captain Hook. The salmon is thick and moist and comes with pickled shallots, caper herbed mayo, and house cured gravlax. Salmon on salmon. I won't say no.\n\nAll burgers are served with a side and I love their shoe string fries. Crispy, thin and perfectly salted for my taste.\n\nAt this point, if you still care about the ambience and the service, here it is. I like both. The restaurant is nice but not overly fancy.  Service is prompt and friendly but not overbearing. \n\nAfter writing this review, I'm tempted to jump in my car and drive down there just for the food. I wish I was kidding..."

The Honey Brown beer was actually really good.  The bar tender was extremely nice and gave me samples of two different beers before I picked one.\n\nThen we sat down at the restaurant.  We were greeted with truffle butter popcorn courtesy of the chef and boy were they delicious.  Then I ordered the Kobe burger with fried avocado and yam with a spicy mayo sauce ($16).  This was a mighty juicy burger, but it's not as good as Burger Bar at the Mandalay Bay.  My friend ordered the duck fat fries and these were delicious with the aroma of the duck fat soaked into the fries.  My steak fries were not comparable.\n\nWe were too full to check the dessert out, but maybe next time.  Overall, a wonderful experience for a new burger joint and will return again if I visit the Cosmopolitan, although I will try out the other restaurants there before returning.

S"Let me start by saying everyone I was with loved this place.  We had a 4-star experience, but I really didn't like my food so -1 star.\n\nI wasn't so wild about it, but they offer a VEGAN burger (the Urth Burger) on their menu so kudos for being vegan inclusive!  It's kind of an odd texture, more like felafel than a veg burger.  Unique is a good word.  It was okay.  I'm pretty sure its made of mostly chickpeas and corn.  The shoestring fries were pretty amazing though.\n\nAlso, the alcoholic shakes are pretty excellent.  Unfortunately only one works for the dairy free crowd.  The smoking passion (or something like that) is Hangar One Mandarin Vodka (see my review on St. George Spirits in Alameda, CA... Hangar One is prob the best vodka I've ever had) and lemon sorbet.  Very tasty.\n\nDefinitely a decent choice for a vegan dining out with meat eaters."

S"I've been in LA too long. I've missed gambling and people who smoke indoors. So, during a much-needed trip to Las Vegas, I decided to stop in to Holsteins to see how these alcohol-infused milkshakes and gourmet burgers compare to the ones in the City of Angels.\n\nAfter winding my way through the Cosmopolitan Hotel past the Chandelier Bar, I spotted the decorative pink-and-white plastic cow emblazoned with the Holsteins logo. At the restaurant, you have the option of sitting at the bar, in the dining area or in the lounge up front, which is composed of some low-riding couches and decorative cartoon tables. I opted to sit in the more traditional dining room because I felt like the seriousness with which I was ready to eat could not be done in a reclining position.\n\nThe cocktail menu is awfully impressive, but I knew that I wanted to try one of the alcoholic milkshakes because, obviously. I chose the Tiramisu Milkshake, and, my goodness, it was good. The milkshakes are all $11, but at least they give you the fancy glass as well as the tin container filled with the remaining shake. The tiramisu shake is made with mascarpone ice cream, ladyfinger cookie crumbs, Patron Caf\xc3\xa9, chocolate syrup, cocoa powder and espresso beans. The shake was thick, chocolatey, liquory and delicious. It was the perfect dessert.\n\nI also ordered a Gold Standard Burger ($17.50), which is a burger topped with smoked bacon, goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, arugula and garlic-chive aioli. My main complaint about the menu is that half of the burgers listed aren't really burgers -- they're fish, fowl or veggie patties, which is totally uninteresting to me. So, as for actual beef patties, there aren't too many to choose from.\n\nThe burger I ordered was still great. It was cooked medium-rare when I requested medium, but I really don't care too much unless I catch salmonella and die. The patty was flavorful. The toppings were pretty good (especially the aioli and cheese), but were not anything that would be my first choice in burger toppers. I was delighted that the burger was so sizable and filling, and it even came with a side of delicious, crunchy, salty shoestring fries.\n\nThe waitress was fantastic. She helped us navigate the menu and was patient with our indecision, and she was also very friendly and stayed to shoot the breeze with us for a while, which made the whole experience a lot more fun and personable. Both the shakes and burgers were brought out quickly, which I appreciated very much because I could not wait another moment to dive into this restaurant's offerings.\n\nThe meal was expensive, but everything was delectable. You won't be hungry again for a good long while after dining at Holsteins.\n\nThey even let us take our alcohol in to-go cups so we could finish drinking while we walked around. I could have cried. Oh, how I've missed Nevada, the land free from open container laws."

S'Traveling to Vegas quite often has allowed me to experience several great establishments for drink and food.  On this occasion I stepped into Holsteins hearing about its reputation after spending time at Public House in the Palazzo.  I must say, I was well impressed.  First off, the beer selection is well organized with several verities that anyone, aficionados to the everyday beer fan can enjoy.  Lets not even get into what happens with the shakes!!! The menu has a fun selection of "bar bites", sliders and burgers.  I enjoyed a combo of truffles lobster Mac and cheese, buffalo dipping sauce and a chunky monkey milk shake with a gulden draak ale as a finisher!  Obviously I\'m off my diet but the 5 years of recovery will be well worth it!  I must say the service was phenomenal!  Lara, the epitome of what a skilled server should be, was attentive, on task, quickly responsive and though busy never missed a moment to check in, smile and make sure my meal was enjoyable!  Never waited more than a couple of minutes between the order and its tabling (drinks) and the food was promptly delivered about 5-10 minutes from time of ordering.  This even while the restaurant was packed and I observed every table top full!  Well done!  \n\nIn summary, I\'m sure just from my limited experience the rest of the menu is going to be delicious.  I will return en force with a large group of friends to do our best to eat everything the kitchen can throw at us and drink every last drop of specialty beers the bar has to offer!  A must visit from now on when I\'m in Vegas!'

S'Stumbled upon this place via Yelp because my friend was craving chicken strips. After getting seated by a cute and cheerful waitress, we got to snack on popcorn while we looked over the menu. (Free popcorn is always a positive in my book!) I ordered the Gold Standard Burger since everyone was raving about it on Yelp. The burger was good, but I have to say.. the fries were definitely drool worthy.\n\nThey had a large variety of "Bam Boozled Shaks" aka boozed up milkshakes. I had a bit of my friend\'s Oreo Milkshake = yum! (And I don\'t even like chocolate..)\n\nBy the way, if you check in on FourSquare, you get a free pint of draft beer!\n\nLove love love the cute cow art decor all over the restaurant.

The burgers where all just ok nothing special but I can say u do get a good size portion for what you pay for. Ordered some appz. And they where ok the best out of the where the steak and cheese spring rolls will be going back for some more of those. Next the chicken and waffles where bland at best and only came with one mini waffle. All the milk shakes where beeter than advertised although I didn't ft a chance to have one of my own all in all the place was jus ok nothing spectacular but I would go again for desserts and milk shakes. Food is hit or miss depending on what u order. Oh also turkey burger was on point for sure"

The shakes are nothing special...even with alcohol you won't get any sort of buzz. As for the burgers...there is something special in their sauce that makes their burgers extraordinary. \n\nBillionaire burger: I wanted to try this because of the foie gras which mind you does not cover the whole burger. It is just a couple of bites before it's all gone with over half the burger left. The sauce is good but I don't think the burger is worth the price \n\nThe fries are average  \n\nLobster Mac n' Cheese: I'd say this dish is poorly executed given that I could not taste the lobster  \n\nThe Gold Standard is delicious...if you're going to order a burger that's the one. The flavors meld together perfectly. This is how a burger should be done. \n\nThere is a free beer when you check in on four square but it's not good at all. I'd pass on it even though it's free."

S"Yum-diddly-yum! This hopping little place inside The Cosmopolitan Hotel in Las Vegas is delicious. The wait was not terrible (15 minutes) and the staff was attentive and friendly. We started with the fried pickle appetizer  - good breaded crunchy coating and equally crunchy dill pickle spears within. A few fried olives in the mix didn't hurt one bit. Hubby ordered the Korean Bull-Gogi burger loaded with a nice soy/kalbi marinade, kimchi, and a fried egg atop a perfectly cooked burger and incredibly toasty bun. This burger was a nice size and had a good side of sweet potato fries with it. I had the lobster roll sliders in mini-hot dog buns with a nice aioli and cup of cole slaw. Great flavor on both entrees. Plus... we each had one of their cool milk-shakes. Mine was the Oreo cookie with Bailey's and hubby had the S'mores with rum. Goodness gracious, set me up with another! Food was pretty reasonably priced for pricey Vegas as well. Try it!"

S"Holsteins is probably the most mismanaged restaurant I have ever been to.  Typically, when I go to Vegas, I like to have at least one meal that isn't quite as formal (and we typically pick something fun like Burger Bar, BLT Burger, Pink Taco, etc).  This time we decided to try Holsteins mostly because the Cosmopolitan is such a nice hotel.  Unfortunately Holsteins wasn't up to par with the service level in the rest of the hotel.  It took about 30 minutes to get our food and they got the order wrong.  They corrected the food part but never gave us our drinks.  About halfway through our meal, the waitress informed us that they weren't making the drink my wife ordered that night (very strange) and they still hadn't got my strawberry milkshake.  We finished our meal and one of the managers came by to clear our plates.  He asked how our meal was and I informed him that I still hadn't gotten my strawberry shake (had mentioned it to the waitress when she was by earlier).  It finally arrived about 15 minutes later (in fairness, the manager did apologize and took the shake off our bill).  We noticed 2 other tables complaining also about the time it was taking to get their food.  All throughout this process they typically had 6 people on the floor (2 cocktail servers in bright red dresses who the bus boys were just hanging around and flirting with, a couple of hostesses...one that was just standing in the middle of the floor and doing nothing, and a couple of managers that weren't doing much of anything).  Although they couldn't just go to the back and flip burgers, my thought process throughout was that they should have had less front end people and more in the kitchen.  If this is typical of this restaurant, we will just frequent the other burger restaurants the next time we're in town Honestly, they're a dime a dozen in Vegas and the service at the other places I mentioned is far superior to Holsteins."

S"I really liked this place. Got a strawberry shake, and it reminded me of Red Robin's shakes which I love. Also, the burgers were delicious and surprisingly not too oily compared to other gourmet burgers. The one thing you have to try is the onion rings. I hate when onions are too large in onion rings, but Holsteins does it right with the thin onion strips and delicious breading.\n\nMy only complaint is the wait time. The first time we went, they told us it was a 30-40 minute wait for our food no matter what we ordered. Food NEVER takes that long to come out even in a steakhouse. We got lucky the second time we went because the waiter told us it was a 30-40 minute wait, noticed we were in a rush, and ended up pulling strings and got our food out in 10 minutes, so kudos to service!"

I also ordered a pitcher of the white sangria which was pretty good.

S"Great happy hour drink offerings from 7-10 pm. We will be back!  We stopped by to check out their menu. It is very diverse and quite extensive. I love that they have their mini burgers. That gave me the opportunity to try a few different burgers, and not have a lot of just the one. I love some of the funky paintings on the wall, especially the one that looks like a lil robot at the front of the restaurant. The decor is amazing and the lighting is perfect. Being that this is part of the cosmo and it's a new establishment, I wasn't surprised that it got kinda crowded. The service is amazing and there wasn't a single complaint or WTH comment from anyone in our party of 9. I love that their menu also includes alcoholic milk shakes, sodas rom around the world and then some. This past visit, everything here impressed me and was perfect. I have to admit, reading some of the previous reviews, I was hoping for the best but was expecting the worst. I can tell you, as of March 19, 2011, this place is amazing.

My friend and I got the kobe beef burger and the steakhouse burger and split them. Just some excellent quality meat... The taste was great too, but it mostly comes from their meat quality, so my hat off to Holsteins. Oh, and let's not forget their crunchy shoe string fries! Yummm...

S'First of all, I want to start off by saying that the Cosmopolitan is starting to irritate me. Everything that is the Cosmopolitan is now obnoxious and boring. The types of people the property attracts is just garbage -- the bottom of the barrel. Don\'t get me wrong. The building and architecture and design of it all is fantastic. LCD screens everywhere, hip little touches here and there make this property great. I just can\'t stand how un-classically Vegas it is. They try so hard to be different, that in the end of it all, they lose themselves. The addition of Holsteins Shakes and Buns to the property is just the cherry on top. I heard ravenous reviews about Holsteins and I was excited to try this place. Things like, "the best burgers in Vegas," and "I Love Love Love Hoslteins" were some of many glowing reviews. Here is my 2 cents.\n\nThe lobster mac and cheese was good, but not great. Surprisingly, the dish had a lot of lobster in it. Unfortunately, the lobster taste was lacking and the texture was not there as well. Lobster usually has a familiarly soft yet firm feeling when you bite it. Theirs was rubbery and lacked flavor. The truffle panko crust on top was nice, but the lack of lobster taste really disappointed me. My favorite part of this dish was the one chip on the side. It consisted of this lobster salad that was full of flavor.\n\nUpon request, which I thought was complimentary, was popcorn. Though it wasn\'t your ordinary popcorn, this one was flavored in some weird mixture. I read that it was truffle popcorn. Excited for some truffle infused popcorn, theirs was definitely not so. It was a mixture of a vinegary, buttery flavor that coated the popcorn. This was a weird mix and though not appetizing, I found myself reaching for the popcorn. I ate it, forgot how it tasted like, and then tried it again. The sting from the popcorn seasoning alone was enough for me not to eat it again. I guess my curiosity superseded my palate.\n\nQuite possibly my favorite food, and naturally, the food I am most knit picking about, the burger is a classic. From the bun to the type of meat, and the almost infinite sauces and toppings you can put on, the burger is a great vessel to work with. With such an iconic item, at a restaurant that supposedly specializes in this stuff, you can\'t mess it up.\n\nAnd now, the Rising Sun burger -- It had Kobe beef, teriyaki glaze, nori furikake, crispy yam, spicy mayo, & tempura avocado. Their take on a Japanese burger sounds good on paper. The fried avocado alone would make me happy. It was fried and crispy, and velvety smooth at the same time. I just didn\'t have enough of it. That probably was the only thing good about this burger. Everything else was a mistake. First of all, what is wrong with this is the Kobe. I hate when restaurants advertise as serving Kobe when we all know most of that is just an American breed, if not, from Australia. Second of all, when you cook a "Kobe" beef burger, it has to be rare. Nothing else will do. What I got was all grey inside. The crust was overly marinated and glazed and turned the meat super dry, and the inside wasn\'t any different. That is one way to kill an almost perfect burger. The teriyaki glaze was much too overwhelming and the crispy yam didn\'t help with the cloyingly sweet flavors. Did I order the wrong burger? Maybe, but that still doesn\'t make up for the overcooked patty.\n\nIf anything, the drunken monkey shake may have been the only thing that was considerably good. It had malted banana gelato and peanut butter crunch. The adult version has Frangelico, a hazelnut liqueur from Italy. I opted out and went with just a regular. "You are in Vegas. Live a little!", you say? In hind sight, maybe I should have made this shake alcoholic. It would have made me feel better about the sub-par meal I just had. Still though, the shake was sweet and the use of gelato made the shave quite delicate and smooth.\n\nPretentious, and yet casual, the restaurant has no identity. I just can\'t associate this restaurant with good food. The same food could be served at a restaurant that looks like, maybe Johnny Rockets, with a lower price, and I still wouldn\'t think twice about it. I mean, they have red and yellow squeeze bottles for ketchup and mustard. Come on! The food really needs an upgrade. How awesome would it be if finally, the Las Vegas Strip had a go-to burger spot that was hip, and of course, delicious? I think that is a home run and a much needed thing on the strip. I guess I just have to wait a couple years for that to happen. For now at the Cosmo, I guess Secret Pizza will have to do.'

S"This place looked interesting when I was walking through the Cosmopolitan on my way to another restaurant, so we went back a few days later. \n\nWe were not starving, so we opted to share a burger, appetizer and milkshake.  If you're really hungry, you'll be able to finish a burger and shake with no problem. \nThey brought out a snack of salt and vinegar popcorn to everyone's table and this stuff is awesome. You'll be asking for another bucket of it.\n\nWe had the Drunken Monkey milkshake and it was everything you want an alcoholic milkshake to be.  I would imagine that all the different flavors would be as well.  \n\nWe ordered the buffalo chicken wing dip as an appetizer.  I've made this stuff at home and loved it, but wasn't thrilled with their take on it.  It was more like a creamy ranch hot sauce mixture, and you couldn't really find the chicken.  It tasted ok, but it isn't something I'd order again. \n\nThe burger was one of the best I've had.  It was the Steakhouse burger and we ordered it medium and it was cooked to perfection.  The flavors popped out all over the place.  If this review were based on the burger alone, I would have given it 5 stars.  Unfortunately, while tasty, the skinny fries were cold.  \n\nIf you're on your way to the Wicked Spoon, save $20 and stop here instead."

Upon arrival we were seated in the dining area away from the bar...a seat near the tv was requested and was received since the place wasnt that busy. Ordered the rising sun burger which is a house favorite...and upon my first bite i figured out why- its f' delicious! Got it medium well with shoe string fries and couldnt be happier...argueable the best burger ive ever had. My brother ordered the california burger  with steak fries also medium well - he enjoyed the perfect amount of spice and the avocado was a great addition to all the flavor. When we checked in via foursquare we discovered a coupon for a complimentary house lager with any entree and after a quick chat with the manager on duty I was drinking free beer! My brother ordered a cup of coffee which the waitress did not add to the bill and thus we tipped handsomely ontop of the already attentive service. Overall a great burger place, a bit pricey but worth it in our opinion. The decorations and atmosphere of the place is really unique too!"

S"It's a gastropub style burger joint with Vegas strip pricing and fancier burgers.\n\nHeard a lot about their milkshakes, ordered a black and white.  Just like everyone says, it's a good milkshake.  So it's definitely worth coming here just for that.\n\nBlack truffle lobster mac 'n cheese: black truffle was too strong.  If the lobster didn't have a distinct color, you wouldn't have even noticed it was in there.  Sauce was underseasoned.  The chip garnish was interesting, but I don't see how that plays in with the dish.  Superfluous...but not a negative.\n\nKorean kimchi hot dogs: was very intrigued by this menu item, but it was underwhelming.  It tasted exactly like a hot dog with bbq sauce.  Didn't get the sour punch from the kimchi, nor did I even notice pork belly in it.  The bun was very soft and delicious though.  \n\nGold standard burger: goat cheese cheddar was wonderful, and my burger was cooked to medium rare which is a plus.  Overall, burger was good, but lacked seasoning.  Bun was nicely done.  \n\nService was spot-on.  We sat in the lounge so we didn't have to wait for a table, so I can't say much for the actual dining service.  \n\nFor what it is, and being in Vegas, I'd say it's a good spot to go for a burger fix.  Is it a top tier burger place?  Remains to be seen when I come back again, because there's a lot of stiff competition out there."

The happy hour seems awesome with the 1$ beers and 1$ shots.\n\nThe service was great and so was the food. The reason this is getting 4 stars is because they appetizers and fries are not that tasty. We ordered the lobster mac n cheese which was just okay, the fried pickles which were decent, and the duck fat tacos which were horrible and small. There are a variety of fries you can order with your dinner. I got the duck fat fries, which I thought might taste a little gamy or greasy, instead they were gross and overcooked. \n\nNow, the best part about this restaurant. I got the sunrise burger ( I think that's the name of it) and it was delicious! This is by far the best burger I've had in Las Vegas. I ordered the kobe burger rare and on top of it came, fried yams, cheese, wasabi dressing, spicy mayo, and tempura avocado.  It was to die for! Everyone needs to try it. \n\nThe prices are also really great. For the four of us to eat it cost about 130$.\n\nWe will be going back soon"

S"Where to start. We had been up for roughly 24 hrs when we sat down at midnight to eat dinner. I was whatever a combination of sick, shitfaced and sleep-absent is and got a drink with ginger beer in it that tasted fantastic and immediately made me feel worse; this I was expecting so no deductions. The in house dj had his system up far enough to interfere with those ears trying to make sense of the Bellagio fountain coordination a mile away but no matter-he was great and had enormous hair. I got a Kobe burger with chips, garlic pickles , and something red on it and it was perfect despite the waitress leering at me when I asked for it well. The french fries came in an exciting metal pail that apparently had been heated in an oven since earlier in the week, and didn't cool down prior to us leaving. We also had the mini tacos which were small but no points deducted as the menu called them effing small so whatever. The girls and their black dresses left for the Marquee Club and a petite Indian man who would welcome them into his private tent and Robert and I ordered another drink and went to find the Cosmo poker room which doesn't exist."

I always seem to go back to the Gold Standard, it's probably my favorite burger there. Everything is a bit expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for... Although they could be a little lower. Half a star down for that.\n\nThe popcorn in buckets while you wait definitely help settle your stomach down a bit. It's so delicious, and I never thought a higher-end restaurant pulled off popcorn as an appetizer so well.\n\nThe other reason they don't have five stars is because of their service. It always seems to take forever to get things.

S"Great place for burgers! Was recommended this place by a friend who compared the quality of the burgers to Father's Office in LA. I haven't tried that place yet but this is definitely a solid joint. \n\nThis place is pretty popular so expect a wait. We were seated after about 25 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. You can leave your number with them and they'll call you when your table is ready.\n\nThe popcorn to start with is really good..honestly they were better than the fries that came with the burger. The fries were kind of bad, reminded me of cafeteria fries and were greasy and soggy, hence taking off one star. The burgers however were well worth the price, huge and delicious. I ordered a steakhouse and, being a gal who sprinkles tons of pepper on everything, enjoyed it very much, however it was definitely more cooked than the medium rare I had asked for. One of my friends got the rising sun which I think I'll try next time, I've never had any burger like it. Another friend got the machete and he said it was the first burger in his life that he couldn't finish, so that gives you an idea about the enormous portion sizes. ;)\n\nDecor is nice, service was pretty slow but overall it was a good experience and I'll be back the next time I'm in Vegas. :)"

S"My rating is based on both the food and the service. My friends and I had come to eat here as we were waiting to check in to our room yesterday. It took about 15 minutes to get our waters. I ordered the ahi poke tostadas as an appetizer. There was an overwhelming taste of lime and cilantro that took over each bite and they were served on stale chips. For my entree, I got the El Machete burger. It was honestly just okay... The bottom bun was a bit soggy which made it difficult to eat with my hands without everything falling out of the burger. The best part of my experience was the fries (which were pretty good, I'll give them that). We were all pretty fed up and wanted to leave rather quickly. then it took a while to get our check which I couldn't understand because I looked around the restaurant and the place wasn't even half full. The most annoying part was that they included gratuity in our bill already (for our party of 6) so we couldnt give them the tip that we felt they actually deserved because they already charged us for it."

Even though place was pretty dead, service was spotty. Our server wasn't super friendly, but she got the job done. Our food came out pretty quickly. \n\nI ordered the Urth Burger, which is their vegan burger. It was fine. The patty was thick and moist. My only complaint is that the burger itself was a bit dry. It was supposed to come with avocado, but there was only a light green schmear on one of the buns. \n\nThe boy ordered the traditional burger. He seemed to love it. He pretty much devoured the whole thing. \n\nBoth the orders came with fries. He got the natural cut fries and I ordered the sweet potato fries. When the fries first came out, there were cold and soggy. We sent them back to the kitchen and got a new batch. \n\nHis natural cut fries were way better than the sweet potato fries. My sweet potato fries were cut too thin, so most of the fries were overcooked and burnt. \n\nPrices are typical of places in Vegas. For our two burgers and a shake, we spent nearly $40, not including tip. \n\nIf this place were back in Austin, I'd probably never go again, but since it's Vegas, I guess it gets a pass."

S"I love that amongst all the hoity toity spots at the Cosmo, there's a laidback burger joint.  Don't get me wrong, my dirty martini still cost $20, but it's a nice casual spot to grab a bite if you don't feel like having a waiter set the napkin on your lap and you want to be able to watch sports at the bar without feeling like a jerk towards your date.\n\nOur group of 7 showed up on a Saturday night, expecting a crazy house and a long wait because they don't take resos on the weekends, but surprisingly we were sat right away at a great table in the middle of the restaurant.  \n\nMy date and I split a classic burger with bacon and cheddar (Lame, I know, but neither of us were that hungry),  as well as the calamari and some sweet potato fries.  Everything was really good.  The burger and calamari were good but nothing special.  The sweet potato fries, on the other hand, were DELICIOUS!  Nothing fancy about them, just simple sweet potato fries that were perfectly crunchy on the outside and hot and yummy on the inside with a hint of saltiness to compliment it's natural sweet flavor.  MMmmmm!\n\nThis is a very fun and casual spot and you still feel like you're in the middle of all the excitement at Cosmo.  \n\nAnd though this is to be expected because it IS the Cosmo, our bill was was a LOT for what we ordered: $46 each, and we shared a burger. Wooo!"

Good place to have a burger and be rowdy with your friends. \n\nI ordered the steakhouse burger with sweet potato fries. Even though it was huge, my burger has such depth of flavor that I was happy to devour all of it. It was spices on top of other spices. It was just delicious. This made me into a burger fan (only a fan of In-n-Out burgers before). \n\nThere are layers and layers of flavors and goodness in each burger. Your taste buds won't be disappointed here."

S'finally writing a review after coming here for the 3rd time, defintiely my favorite "gourmet burger" place in vegas \n\nlocated on the second floor of cosmopolitan. Wait time usually isn\'t that bad, but you can make a reservation if you go on a busy weekend just in case. \n\nThey start you off with popcorn thats seasoned with something\n\nimma just say those alcoholic shakes get me feelin some type of way nuff said, or i was just tired from EDC week \n\nThe first 2 times i was here i got the billionaire burger, foie gras anything i can\'t really resist. The only bad thing about this burger is it\'s like double the price of all their other burgers\n\nThe third time i came here i got the\n\ncrispy pork belly bun and that shit sooo good, unless you don\'t like fat, cus i bit into a fatty ass piece and just about died \n\nI also got the ahi sliders, they\'re hella good too, nothing abnormal about them they\'re exactly what they sound like. even tho ahi mini tostadas would be more appropriate since they come on fried wonton wrappers\n\ni probably should be talking shit about this restaurant and saying to go to burgr or some other sub par gourmet burger place so i can keep this location to myself, but i guess sharing is caring'

S'So here\'s the thing: I love this place, but I\'m teetering on 3 stars. If there were 3.5, I\'d give it that. When we FIRST visited this place not long after it opened, we raved and told everyone how amazing it was.  And their burgers are very good. Very, very good.\n\nBut, we\'ve gone a handful of times now and the last few, I\'ve been kind of embarrassed that we raved so much about it to the guests we brought with us. Our server, the last two times, hasn\'t offered us our locals discount (even though we introduced ourselves as locals when we sat down). The first time, we didn\'t know and another server is the one who asked if we got our discount. The second time, we pointed it out on the bill and he went back and took it off.\n\nBut the guy who served us the last two times, while nice enough, was more interested in chatting with the hostesses than bringing us popcorn or refilling our water or pretty much anything. And we were seated in this corner so if we wanted to get anyone\'s attention, we\'d have to get up and poke our heads around the side to flag him down.\n\nHe (or the kitchen, can\'t be sure) slathered my turkey burger in Russian dressing, despite me asking for it on the side twice -- in fact, the server and I had a whole conversation that went something like this:\n\nMe: "Could I please have the Russian dressing on the side or not at all?"\n\nHim: "So, look, do you want it or not?"\n\nLook, FLO, I don\'t want it at all, I was just trying to be flexible. Instead, I had to wait while my friends ate so they could de-Russian my turkey burger, which if I\'m being honest, wasn\'t that great. (The turkey burger sliders are also a snooze, skip \'em.)\n\nMy other beef (no pun intended) with this place is the volume. I appreciate that it\'s Vegas and that people are there to par-tay, etc, but I\'d like to eat my dinner without having to scream across the table. And this is in the dining room, not even in the lounge area, where it\'s seriously hearing-damage territory and the bass rumbles under your ass while you\'re trying to enjoy your sliders. It\'s just not my jam, so to speak.\n\nI can highly recommend the Gold Standard and the Steakhouse burger, both of which are delectable and worth every penny. I like their wedge-cut fries, as well.  Two of my friends have told me the Captain Hook salmon burger is also really good.  \n\nOther high points: the decor is interesting and creative, and aside from this one lackluster server and the occasional snooty hostess, the staff is warm and welcoming. They menu has expanded as well and they\'ve got a lot of interesting choices. They\'re great at their social media, too. Love that.  \n\nOverall, I do really like Holstein\'s and am rather bummed to review it this way.A year ago, it would\'ve been at least 4.'

S'It\'s both a blessing and a curse that that Vegas is so far away, otherwise I\'d be visiting Holsteins on a far more frequent basis.\n\nIn contrast to the sharp trendiness of the Cosmopolitan Hotel itself is Holsteins, a lighthearted, family-friendly (relatively speaking of course!) burger-n-fries type of place that offers many interpretations of the word "indulgence." \n\nOur wait to be seated took about a minute or two at most, but this was during a Monday lunchtime visit - so I wouldn\'t be surprised to know that this place becomes quite packed over the weekends.\n\nAccording to the restaurant\'s website, Holsteins no longer offers its Crispy Calamari appetizer - what a bummer!. The calamari itself has a wonderfully crunchy texture and the grilled lemon wedges provided on the side provided a tangy flavor as well as a subtle hint of charred smokiness. The Tabasco-honey dipping sauce was also fantastic, creating a welcome balance between sweetness and a slightly spicy kick. I hope that this dish somehow finds it way back on to the menu soon, as it was one of the best iterations of calamari that I\'ve had in recent memory!\n\nFor our burger selection, we shared a "Fun-Ghi" Burger, which was packed to the brim with many of my favorite things. Indeed, there were mushrooms aplenty (check), caramelized onions (check), gruyere (check), and even a truffle mayo that gave the burger an earthy aroma and that signature truffle flavor. The patty itself was juicy and flavorful; it was also cooked to a perfect medium-rare.\n\nWe also split an order of Truffle Lobster Mac-N-Cheese (might as well go all in if you\'re indulging like this!), which had nice contrasts of creaminess and crisp crunch (thanks to the breaded topping, of course). In contrast to some macaroni & cheese dishes found at other establishments, this version wasn\'t overly rich or oily. Its stronger, more pronounced cheese flavor complemented the burger quite well. \n\nIn sharing this appetizer, a burger, and a side, my girlfriend and I were pretty much stuffed. The portion sizes were bigger than what we\'re accustomed to getting for the price (cough, Umami, cough). This being said, expect somewhat of a price markup...it is Sin City after all.\n\nWe didn\'t get a chance to try any of the famed Holstein\'s "adult" shakes (in large part because we had already gotten drunk earlier that morning), but some of the combinations listed on the menu looked pretty interesting. In particular, the "Red Velvet Cake Shake" really jumps off of the page!\n\nWhile the whole "high-end burger" scene seems to be flourishing into quite the business these days, places like Holsteins prove that there are ways to excel at both image and execution. I\'ll certainly be back.'

S"They should rename this place Holsteins Beers and Buns. The beer selection was amazing and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable in all 132 beers! \n\nAfter ordering our beers, it was time to pick a burger. I had the nom nom burger. This was Kobe beef, cheddar cheese, potato chops and 1,000 island dressing. I wasn't impressed with my burger, it was just okay. I asked for medium and it came out well done so my burger was pretty dry and lacking juices. \n\nMy boyfriend got the steakhouse burger (Beef patty crusted with black pepper, Holsteins creamy steakhouse sauce, tomato confit, marmalade onions, wild mushrooms, and Swiss cheese). This was much better than my burger! However, he ordered medium rare and it was more cooked than he wanted. \n\nWe both got fries with our burgers and they were just okay. We like our fries more crispy. Our favorite part of our meals were our beers. We are interested in coming back for another drink sometime!"

S"SPOILER ALERT\n\nThis.\n\nPlace.\n\nSucks.\n\n--\n\nOk well they only kind of suck because I did enjoy my milkshake and the awesome steak fries, but everything else was a HUGE disappointment especially my burger.  I guess my beef with Holsteins (pun intended) was that my burger came out almost well done when I ordered it medium rare.  Yeah I should have sent it back but I was STARVING and didn't want to get an extra topping in my burger if you know what I mean.  So I scarfed it down and here I am now on Yelp LOL!  \n\nAnd it doesn't stop there. I also had the absolute WORST lobster roll of my life here.  In fact, I wouldn't even consider it a lobster roll, more like a little bit of lobster inside a huge untoasted unbuttered cold stale roll with bbq marks as if it was on the grill trying to pass itself off as a lobster roll, so do me a favor y'all actually do yourself a favor and DO NOT ORDER this unless of course you want a little more disappointment in your life, because if that's what you need then by all means have at it...\n\nYeah it looks nice and they have cool art an shit to confuse your taste buds, but the truth of the matter is I would never ever recommend this place to anyone, even someone I didn't like.  You're better off gambling your money away or spending it on booze or strippers or giant guitar shaped margaritas or ziplining on Fremont Street.  Hell for the price I paid here I think I could have gotten a day pass for ziplining, which I promise you would have been a whole helluva lot more enjoyable than anything here (except for the milkshakes)."

S'Burgers are played out.\n\nThere, I said it...  It seems like no matter what major city you are in, there\'s some strong competition on who has the best burger.  It isn\'t as if we see the same thing with who has the best beshbarmak (go ahead and look it up, edu-ma-cate yourselves), right?\n\nBut with that said, I must admit, I\'m a bit of a burger fiend.  I do love me a good burger.  Always medium rare, and I also tend to look for interesting topping combinations to see how creative the kitchen is.\n\nThis is where I\'ve been going wrong all this time.\n\nYou see, something needs to be said and credit needs to be given to the places that honor the burger for what it is SUPPOSED to be.  A patty made of ground beef served between two slices of bread, usually in bun form.  Toppings are typically added to compliment the meat and bread combination.  That\'s it.\n\nIt is with that in mind that I have to say Holstein\'s does a pretty mean burger.\n\nTheir meat is spectacular.  Maybe the best beef patty out there.  Assuming they use their namesake breed, I can tell you that the beef is very flavorful, and yet holds up in its patty form without being too greasy.\n\nWe split two orders with the notion of being able to taste a couple of their burgers.  Both were quite nice, and had pretty simple toppings.  The bun is notable since it has a lovely glaze on it and holds up well to all the juices that come off the patty and toppings.  The meat, as noted before, is the star.  Toppings, at least in our case, were more like condiments that complimented the beef rather than over powering the flavors.\n\nIn a way, very simple, but done correctly.\n\nIt also needs to be said that the Frozen Grasshopper is amazing.  Imagine a Shamrock Shake with booze in it, except it still just tastes like a better version of the Shamrock Shake.  Got it?  Yep- it\'s really good...\n\nBeer selection is a\'ight.  Prices are a bit steep compared to many "gourmet" burger joints, but PLEASE REMEMBER where the hell you are.  Does ANYTHING come at a "reasonable" price on the Strip?  When you consider that fact, I\'d say Holstein\'s actually is a very reasonable place to grab a meal.'

S'located in the hustle bussel of the cosmopolitan. this place would be busy whether it is good or bad. \n\n**the steakhouse burger- Beef Patty Crusted With Black Pepper, Holsteins Creamy Steak Sauce, Marmalade Onions, Tomato Confit, Wild Mushrooms, Swiss Cheese. When they say "crusted with black pepper" they were not kidding. this "black pepper" was like crushed pepper corn covering every inch of the cheese slice. you must love black pepper to be able to enjoy this burger. it was quit yummy\n\n**the fun-ghi- Beef Patty, Roasted Portabello, Carmelized Onion, Truffle Oil, Gruyere, Frisee, Aioli. nothing special to note about this burger. you could smell the fragrance of the truffle oil which i love, but the flavor wasn\'t strong. i love black pepper so i liked the steakhouse burger better and it seemed more juicy.\n\nof note. they don\'t take reservations on the weekend. but the plus side is that when you put your name down they will text/call you when your table is ready and give you about 10 minutes to respond before they give it away.\n\ni\'ve been here two times and both times the food didn\'t live up to the hype. the burgers are quite expensive. coming out to around ~$23 per person with tax and tip for just the burger entree, nothing extra, no drinks etc. that is QUITE expensive for a burger and fries in my book. and this isn\'t anything fancy. to my knowledge (i could be wrong) its not grass fed organic meat or anything. i probably won\'t be back due to the cost but might stop by to try a milkshake.'

It was pretty tasty, though it was $14 for a smallish starter. \n\nThe hen house burger was good, but a bit messy. I am never a fan of a burger that is so juicy that it soaks through the bottom bun and makes the burger fall apart. Then it all goes to pieces and you end up being that guy eating a burger with a fork and knife. Never good. \n\nAnyway, the hen house was tasty. They seem to skimp on the fries though.

S'If your friends love burgers, like mine do, this is the perfect place to take them for any special event. A group of us came here for a birthday. We called ahead of time to make a reservation because it was a mid size group and around the holiday season. When we got there, the place was busy, but you could get away without making a reservation.\n\nThe decor is warm, well lit, with splashes of colorful art. \n\nThe server was friendly, attentive when we needed her, and kept her distance while we were celebrating. Orders were taken promptly, waters were refilled regularly, and food was brought out in a timely manner.\n\nThe star of this place is the food. The ambiance is nice, but you forget about all that when the food appears. The alcohol milkshakes are amazing. They will definitely satisfy the child and adult within you. We tried four different kind that day. The Framboise float was not well balanced. Although we love the raspberry cider, it overpowered the vanilla ice cream. On the other hand, the campfire smores, orange dreamscicle, and the brown cow were delicious. They had enough alcohol to get you feeling good without the constant reminder.\n\nStarting out with the artichoke "guac" was unimpressive. In fact, looking back, I cannot remember it as vividly as I do with everything else we ordered.\n\nNow the burgers are spectacular. If you like it rich, decadent, and everything not good for you then this is the place for you. My group had our burgers family style to share. We got two gold standards; aged beef, smoked bacon, goat cheese, greens and aioli. They were delicious. The meat was moist, the saltiness of the cheese and bacon balanced well with the burger. Next was the captain hook; a salmon filet, greens, pickled shallots, and a caper mayo. The fish was charred and crispy on the outside while moist on the inside and the shallots gave it a nice zing. Now this is were we started to go over board and into the heart attack warning zone. The longhorn burger is amazing because it not only has a patty, but stacks on beef brisket, coleslaw. dill pickles, and then slathers it in whiskey BBQ sauce. This monster was disgustingly delicious, had my friend panting half way. Nothing beats the duck, duck, goose if you are talking about self indulgence. The duck confit and froie gras stuffed patty is ridiculous. When you bite into the succulent patty, you are first greeted by mouth watering beef, followed by the creaminess of the duck liver. The blend of all this with the plum sauce is amazing. If you are not a duck or liver fan, avoid this burger because it is ever present throughout. Top it all off with a few orders of duck fat fries and you might as well check into the hospital next.'

Burgers were alright though my Hen House did come with a fried over easy egg that was cooked through. When I told the food runner about this he argued with me and told me that its supposed to be runny, Uh yeah. He finally said that's how its supposed to be and walked off, I begged to differ. At one glance our waiter said it was wrong and fixed it, very cool! Burger was pretty dang good with loads of gooey yolk running down my fingers.

The BF had the onion rings and I had fries (which were cold and I had to ask for a fresh order because they were definitely stale). \n\nWe didn\'t have a lengthy meal (it was lunch time) and I didn\'t think we were being annoying by any means with what we ordered, refills, etc.  but it felt like we had quite a long lunch \n\nThe burgers themselves were quite good but with the time, service and price tag for it all, I\'d say that it\'s just "OK".  \n\n$66 before tip for 2 burgers, 2 shakes, onion rings and fries.'

They make it in house and it is delicious! It is a great option for someone like me who tries to eat less animal protein. \n\nThey also have 4 TVs behind the bar and it is great to be able to watch a few different games while you are having lunch or just a beer. \n\nAs the other reviewer noted, the shakes look amazing.

S'The online reservations we made through Yelp were completely worthless, as we still had to wait nearly an hour before we were seated. Plus, the hostess was just kinda bitchy in general... It really dampened the mood. \n\n Thankfully, our waitress was nicer and pretty on top of everything. We tried both kinds of fries and neither were great, but their chocolate milkshake just made it into my top three ever. \n\nMy "Longhorn" burger was delicious, but it would have been plenty of food if it were just a beef brisket sandwich, but of course there was a huge burger patty on there too... seriously filling.\n\nJim G. really summed it up great when they described the atmosphere as "bordering on douchey" ... It doesn\'t help that they are inside the drunk-girl trendy Cosmopolitan hotel, right next to the dayclub/nightclub.'

S'If you are a big fan of duck and foie gras, as I am, you will love, love, LOVE the Duck, Duck, Goose Burger. Also, their "Bam Boozled" (technically alcoholic, but there is so little alcohol that it\'s almost unfair to say they contain alcohol) Pina Colada Shake may be the best milkshake I\'ve ever had anywhere. I do have issue with the hefty $11 price tag though (I\'m assuming the "alcohol" contained within technically makes it a cocktail, thus the rational for the extraordinary cost - I really wish there was a $6 non-alcoholic version). Nevertheless, Holsteins definitely has the most interesting burgers in Las Vegas and definitely worth the try if you\'re big on non-traditional burgers.'

S"Holsteins shakes are like a spiked milkshake ! They have really great creations and they were so good ! I recommend the Frozen Grasshopper or the Drunken Monkey. These are delicious !!! \n\nFrom there, we went on and had a few apps on the menu. The Lobster Mac and Cheese, Lobster rolls, sliders, and the bruschetta. Everything was AMAZING except for the crab bruschetta. Took a small bite and passed the plate. The only think I would say about this is that the bartender didn't take it off our bill. We did state that it was not good and shouldn't be recommended to people but it's an $18 app so I guess upselling is where this came in. I'm going to continue on how great everything else was though. The Lobster Mac and Cheese and Lobster Rolls were dynamite ! The size of actual lobster in these small plates were terrific and so so good ! The mini sliders were great too ! The staff and bartender we had was really nice ! \n\nHighly recommend this place ! At least if you're passing by, just go for the shakes !"

S'I\'m sure my perception of food choices in Vegas is skewed as more often than not they come after a heavy drinking session (either immediately after or the next day).  At that point almost anything would taste great.  Holsteins came highly recommended and after sleeping through the breakfast hour it was time to skip directly to lunch anyway.\n\nWhen presented with a burger voted Vegas\'s best, it\'s hard to consider anything else.  I went with the Gold Standard Burger and wasn\'t disappointed.  Sweet Potato fries were another plus. To top things off I ordered one of the "boozy milkshakes", going with the Oreo and Bailey\'s version (I wasn\'t adventurous enough to go for the Captain Crunch).  I left plenty satisfied and a little overstuffed, but overall I would recommend this place for a hearty lunch or dinner (skipping breakfast was a good call).'

S'"Gourmet" burger joints are a dime a dozen down on the Vegas strip. What makes Holsteins stand out are the milkshakes. They have your average flavors to chose from, but they also have many adult, cocktail inspired milkshakes. What makes a mint chocolate chip milkshake stand out? Add some peppermint schnapps! \n\nI had a regular burger, and it was tasty as well. The decor was a nice and open area and the service was what you would expect.

S"My bff and I recently stayed at the Cosmo and visited Holsteins twice. Here's how it went for us:\n\nDay one - Bff had just finished running the Las Vegas Rock 'n' Roll Marathon, so we were in no mood to be messing around. Vegas was crazy-crowded, and we had no reservations, so we expected to wait quite some time. I was pleasantly surprised when our beeper went off after only 15 minutes.  I started with an Absolut dirty martini (the best way to judge a decent bar), and it was very good!    Then I ordered The Classic with blue cheese, and had no idea what type of fries to order. I panicked and went with steakcut.  The burger was excellent; big, thick and juicy, with a bun that was just the right size and a good amount of cheese. The fries were good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nDay two - Bff and I both had some things on the menu that we wanted to try, so back we went.  Absolut dirty martini? Yes, and though it was a different bartender, it was again excellent. This time we were prepared for an appetizer, and agreed on the pizza twinkies out of sheer curiosity (and a mutual lifelong love of pizza).  They were a revelation; crispy bread surrounding melty cheese with a delicious tomato relish-type dip.  Truly great.  Then we both ordered a burger. I can't remember the name, but it was a thick burger between a layer of kettle chips and thousand island dressing. It was awesome. We ordered the shoestring fries and were again underwhelmed, so we ordered a side of onion rings. THOSE. WERE. EXCELLENT.\n\nTo summarize, I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the vicinity. The only thing keeping me from awarding it 5 stars is that I found the service to be rather slow and indifferent. On both nights it took them quite awhile to check in with us once we were seated, and even longer to make sure we were ok once we had our food."

S'What a disappointing experience! My fiance and I chose Holsteins this past Sunday. We arrived at 8pm and the hostesses asked if we had a reservation. We did not, and they weren\'t seating until 8:45pm without reservations, which is fine, so we went to another fine Block 16 Hospitality establishment across the street--Pinks--as we were in a hurry. \n\nAfter eating our delicious hotdogs, we went back to the Cosmopolitan and asked the hostesses if we could make a reservation for after the concert we were headed to that evening. They told us that we couldn\'t make a reservation but it shouldn\'t be a problem as their last seating was 11:45pm. \n\nFast forward, the concert ended and we hurried over to Holsteins and arrived at 11:30pm. We waited our turn in line and then the hostess informed us that they were no seating. Now I\'m upset so I complained and asked for a manager\'s contact information and instead of giving it to me, they seated me. \n\nThe service by our server, Scot, was TERRIBLE. He was clearly bothered by our late seating, noting upon arriving at the table, "Well, you guys sure got a late seat". Not hello. No greeting. Terrible. He took our orders (food and drink) all at once so that we could make it a faster dining experience. My milkshake came out as did our friend\'s diet coke but my fiance\'s Miller Lite didn\'t come and then the food arrived. I asked the runner about the beer and 5 minutes after the food arrived, Scot runs by, slams an unopened can of Miller Lite down on the table and then runs away. He didn\'t inquire about our food. He didn\'t open the beer. He was just generally absent from the entire experience and made us feel rushed and unwelcome. \n\nThe food was delicious but overcooked. I asked for my burger, The Gold Standard, rare and received a burger that was tan with a hot pink center. Same for my fiance. Additionally, both of us became violently ill about 2 hours later that evening. As someone who works in the service industry living in a town that revolves around service, this experience was extremely disappointing.'

S"Holsteins is a good option if you're in/near the Cosmopolitan and looking for a more casual place to sit down and eat.  They have a pretty large menu with a number of different burgers, sandwiches, alcoholic milkshakes, and other fun versions of bar food.  \n\nThe food here was expensive for what it was (not a surprise, it's Vegas) and it was good, but I have definitely had a better burger.  I tried the new England Turkey Burger and the toppings were great (frisee, cranberry mayo, and stuffing), but the burger itself was weird... almost more like sausage than ground turkey?\n\nThe sweet potato fries were really good and I loved the truffle popcorn that they leave on the tables to snack on before your meal.\n\nDon't come here if you're in a hurry to catch a show-- the service is sloooow even when the place isn't that busy."

S"Love the cosmopolitan and have been to Holsteins a couple of times.  It has a fun and casual decor (hot pink cow in front) matched with a really nice looking bar.  \n\nSat at the bar both times.  The bartenders were friendly and suggestive without being too intrusive.  They have a great beer selection and will help recommend one if you want to try something new.  Although I usually like ordering specialty cocktails at places like this, I noticed that they had bubble-gum vodka (one of my favorites) so the bartender made me a  bubble-gum martini that was delicious! It was pink and girly...definitely what I was in the mood for. \n\nFor food I had the duck 'street tacos'. I love anything and everything with duck, but then add foie gras, and truffle cream and stuff it into a crispy tortilla? yuuummmm! \n\nAlso ordered the Lobster Mac-n-cheese. Its a perfect size portion (so you can eat it all and be guilt-free). I just happen to be a mac-n-cheese connoisseur, so I've had my share of cheesy noodles. This one is really good with the lobster and truffle cream, but not my favorite. However the dish comes with a mini lobster BLT that is so good I would definitely order it again. (You can only get this little mini blt with the mac, it's not a menu item on its own). \n\nHolsteins is a cool hang-out spot.  Not just an ordinary burger joint, they have really creative things on the menu that you wouldn't expect. Will definitely come back, there are still so many things I want to try!"

Everything is presented well and taste is big!\n\nDesserts are creative too. I grabbed the Coffee and Donuts which sounds awfully normal. However, it was presented on a platter as a chocolate infused coffee with marshmallows served with gourmet donut holes filled with different flavored pastry cremes (like cardamom and cinnamon). SUPER tasty.\n\nGreat joint, great MUSIC too. They must have a resident DJ who does some creative transitions between classic 80s.\n\nDefinitely going back!"

S'I checked in at Holstein\'s yesterday with my husband, we usually do a date/day or night at least once I week, we are locals so we usually don\'t go to the strip much. I had the chicken fingers and natural cut fries, and my hubby had a burger and onion rings.. The fingers were very good( I am a super picky eater). My hubby was making the hmm hmm sound the whole time he are and the onion rings were fried perfectly and they didn\'t fall apart and leave you just eating the onion. The two HUGE ISSUES I had were with our bartender/ waitress who was nice and attentive BUT a little to much with my husband... It was like she took care of my needs as a customer but engage in convo with him, kept her eyes on him and when my hubby and I shared an inside joke that we shared, you told me.... Be nice..really?? Like I said we are locals and I have been a waitress, cocktail server and a blackjack dealer and I know the whole " flirt a little" deal but not with someone\'s husband. We both had our wedding rings on and we were affectionate. I think she should be careful with that, I was kinda taken aback..

It just missed the mark for me. It was a little too well done and lacked flavor. \nMy husband got the El Machete and really liked it. \n\nI had checked in on four square which gave me a free beer, so I ordered that with my waiter.

I thought it was average, but I can\'t put my finger on what I thought it was lacking.  Maybe pickles?

Looked like a "Lbs Burger or Bachi Burger".. Well, come to find out this place was related to "Lbs", same chef.. It came with Dry Aged Beef Sirloin, smoked bacon, aged goat cheddar cheese, tomato confit, baby arugula, garlic-chive aioli on a kinda sweet bun.. The medley of flavors worked pretty well but just like "lbs" and even Bachi burger, I was not blown away. Just merely satisfied.. The burger patty wasn\'t that flavorful but had a nice texture. It was all the supporting toppings that gave it some life. Overall, it just didn\'t do it for me..\n\nSteak cut fries: Awesome! Delicate light crunchy skin and inside had a crumbly fine mashed potato textured consistency.

Partly because I was starved and partly because it was good. We did have to wait about 20 minutes to be seated, but it was no big deal. The Chandelier is right across the way and they call you when you're table is ready. So, we went and had a drink at the Chandelier. The place is pretty big and there is plenty of tables and booths. They have a bar you can sit at and tv's which was good for all of the guys watching March Madness. Also, the menu is pretty extensive if you like burgers. We absolutely had to try one of the spiked shakes. I got the Drunken Monkey. Soooooo good. I drank it before my burger even made it out. It was delicious!

S'SO PRICEY but really good. At $16-$18 per burger, it\'s pricey, but it\'s Vegas; you gotta be prepared to pull out the cash.\n\nThey are pretty creative with the burgers, I\'ll give them that. The burger patties themselves aren\'t that flavorful, but it\'s all the different toppings and condiments on each burger that make each burger tasty.\n\nI\'ve eaten here twice with friends and these are the burgers we\'ve tried that have been consistently good:\n\nThe Billionaire - foie gras! Not a huge piece of it, but you can certainly taste that it\'s there.\nThe Rising Sun - essentially a teriyaki burger, but it\'s got a good rich but sweet taste to it.\nThe Golden Standard - can\'t pinpoint any one thing inside this burger that made it taste really good, but the moment you take a bite of the whole thing it comes together wonderfully!\nThe Nom Nom - texture with potato chips inside and tasty special mayo sauce!\n\nMILK SHAKES (alcoholic ones!):\n\nRed Velvet - my fav, really delicious can\'t taste the alcohol at all. Little cookie bits inside for texture.\nTiramisu - strong but tasty. Lots of cookie and chocolate toppings, chocolate syrup and cookie bits inside!\nMint chocolate chip - only alright. Didn\'t mask the alcohol that well, tastes pretty simple, like melted mint ice cream with cookie bits inside.\n\nAND OMG GET THE LOBSTER MAC \'N CHEESE. IT IS SO DAMN GOOD. But it is so damn small for how much you pay for it ($18). It comes out in a small...I\'d say 5"x4" cast iron tray. If it weren\'t for the price, I would just eat three orders of the lobster mac and cheese for the entire meal.\n\nService was only O-K. The waitresses usually seem distracted because the place is so busy, and the food didn\'t come out very fast. They refused to seat 10 of us at a table and split us up 7 and 3 and told 3 of us to sit at the bar, but there were no seats available at the bar because it was a dinner rush... so we just pulled up three chairs at the table and everyone fit just fine.'

S"After experiencing the worst burger I've ever had in Vegas, I felt compelled to email Holsteins to give them the opportunity to explain why my experience was so bad. Never heard back from Holsteins, which to me, is one of the hallmarks of poor customer service. The burger was dry, tasteless and very expensive. Don't mind paying nearly $20 for a burger, but it should be damned near as good as a burger can get. Save your dough and go to any fast food drive-in for your burger; it will taste better, and you'll have enough scratch left over for a movie."

S"The thing that initially drew me to Holsteins was that I needed a place for dinner at the Cosmopolitan that was more budget friendly than China Poblano and Jaleo. When the bill arrived I'm not so sure we saved much, but at least our belly's were full. \n\nNo particular dish my group ordered stood out as amazing 'must try.' I had the Steakhouse burger. It was good but a little too greasy for my liking. My friend ordered the Urth Burger. I had a few bites and found it quite bland. I was also disappointed that my sweet potato fries were lukewarm. The item I was most impressed with we're the onion rings. The onion was cut thick and generously battered. \n\nLogistically, I liked that they took my cell phone number and called me when our table was ready, so my group was able to have a drink in the Chandelier bar while we waited. Overall not a bad choice for dinner but also nothing to brag about."

S'We went at lunch time and they brought a small basket of dry, cold, tasteless popcorm to the table... one bite and we left the rest.\n\nNext we shared lobster roll sliders - the hot dog buns were toasted, but left to cool and became dry - the lobster salad was finely chopped... I suspect claw meat... flavorless - I\'ve had better lobster salad at a supermarket deli counter.\n\nFinally the $17.50 burger (plus a $2 upcharge for onion rings.  The onions rings were described by our waiter as "lightly battered and lightly fried"... they were heavily breaded and overcooked.  The toppings on the burger were tasty, but the Kobe burger was smallish, dry and overcooked... Kobe should have a decent amount of fat due to marbling, but this one did not.\n\nBottom line - overpriced ($48 plus tip for the roll, burger and one glass of house wine) run-of-the-mill food and, although the service was good, we will not be back, nor will we recommend.'

The chicken and waffles was soooo bad, and the burger.... Let's not even go there.... So bad\n\nSo I stupidly decided to give it another try, I ordered the gold standard, i ordered it medium, and it showed up 2 minutes after i had ordered it.... Meaning that it had been precooked... Who knows how long that burger had been sitting because they were not busy enough to keep precooked burgers, and they don't even grind their own meat!!! Yeah I couldn't finish it, and I can say I'm never going back, nor would I recommend this place to anyone."

The Sakeoke (karaoke in the back bar) needs some help. The song list is short, the DJ is a little clueless, and the signage for the nightly event is sorely lacking. Don't worry if the front staff seems a bit pretentious; they are. But the back room staff and managers are great. The food is pricey when you don't realize that you ordered your 5th drink after your third song. You'll find it easy to make new friends at the karaoke. Have fun."

S"My cousin and I decided to try out this restaurant during our Memorial weekend trip in Vegas. I was extremely excited to try this place because of all of the positive reviews/rants I've heard. I am always looking to try new Sushi places and I must admit that I am quite the Sushi expert!\n\nThe first thing I must say is that this place is pricey! For $85 I only able to order:\n\n- 2 glasses of Cabernet Sauvignons\n- 2 Miso Soups ($6.00 each and only had 1 Tofu in each bowl of soup)\n- Rainbow Dragon Roll\n- 2 Avocado Salmon Rolls\n- 1 Piece of Salmon Sashimi (embedded in an unknown vegetable)\n- 3 Hand Rolls\n\nMay I remind you that all of this was shared between two people. The portion size was fairly small. However,the freshness and the quality of the fish was amazing. That is probably the only thing positive about this restaurant. Oh yes, can't forget the fancy lighting and ambiance.\n\nI was not impressed by the originality of the menu nor the taste of the food. I have tasted better sushi rolls for more than half the price of a Sushi Samba roll. I would have rather spent $85 at my local sushi restaurants in San Jose. At least there will be many tofu pieces in my miso soup not only 1. =P\n\n-"

We preferred this as the music inside the restaurant was at night club volume. Our order included Jumbo Shrimp Seviche (amazing), the El Topo roll (it's so unique they trademarked it), the Shrimp Tempura roll, and Shisito peppers. With our food and five drinks later (2 mojitos and 3 caipirinhas), our bill was $65. If you're staying at the Palazzo or anywhere in Vegas for that matter, it's definitely worth a visit."

S"It was a good experience to try something new in sushi, but there was nothing that really stood out in taste that would make me return. We took a lot of the server's recommendations for popular items like the specialty dishes sea bass with Peruvian corn and Yellowtail Taquitos served like tapas, which were both good. The Peruvian corn was ok, but didn't seem to have a complimenting taste with the sea bass. We let the server know and he brought out some Purple Potato Mash just to try something different and it was better than the corn. \n\nThe service was great. Our server was very knowledgeable about the food, how it was prepared and the types of sake that was offered. We enjoyed 4 different sakes, which was more enjoyable than the sushi. \n\nIf you want to feel like you ate a lot, stick with mostly rolls... the rice will help fill you up.\n\nTypical price for food in LV... $$$... although I didn't think we ordered that much and the cost was just short of the 200 mark for two.\n\nGood Brazilian/Peruvian fusion... but if I had a choice between this and traditional sushi... obviously traditional."

S"I wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but I'll round down. Came here with my sister for a convention in Vegas, we walked around the Venetian and Pallazzo for a while until we finally decided on SushiSamba.  First of all, the restaurant is beautiful. I really love the wall painings, interior design, and the bathroom design was really cool as well. Service here was excellent, my water was always full, when I got up to use the restroom I placed my napkin on the table, when I came back it was neatly folded back for me. \n\nWe decided to get two appetizers. First the Rock Shrimp Tempura... Really no point in ordering this. Tempura taste the same everywhere, nothing special about theirs. We also tried the taquitos as suggested by the waitress. These were really just mini taco's. Main Lobster and Yellowtail. Both were nice and chilled taco's. Good sauce on the side. Not sure if I'd order them again, but they were decent.\n\nFor dinner my sister ordered their Miso Marinated Chilean Sea Bass. This was absolutely excellent. The fish was cooked perfectly, it was so soft and delicious. It's served with vegetables and those were pretty good too. Possibly the post Chilean Sea Bass I've ever had. \n\nFor my dinner I decided to order two rolls, the Neo Tokyo and the BoBo Brazil. The Neo Tokyo, which is bigeye tuna and tempura flake was delicious. The little sauce on top was a nice spicy sauce. This roll was very delicious. As for the BoBo Brazil.... Quite gross, too much avocado, wayyy too much in fact, in overpowered the entire roll. Both regular avocado and some mushy avocado. In addition the red onion also gave it some very odd taste. This was one of the worst sushi rolls I have ever eaten.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the Samba split for two. It was really good, and a decent sized portion. Everything on the plate complemented each other and the banana brulee was fantastic."

S'I had a quick dinner with some work colleagues at Sushi Samba the night we arrived at the hotel. The wait on a Sunday night was about 45 minutes ... so we asked if we could sit/eat at the bar. They said it was fine and were promptly seated.\n\nWe ordered 3 sushi rolls and 1 entree along with a couple of beers and one cocktail. For three people our bill was well over $100 and we didn\'t really have that much to eat. The service at the bar was friendly, but unattentive ... they seemed more interested in talking with each other than the customers that night. It was good, but I can\'t see paying $14+ for "specialty" rolls and $8-9 for a standard spicy tuna roll that you can get at a very good sushi restaurant for $5-6 anywhere other than on the strip in Vegas. I know ... it\'s Vegas, everything is expensive ... but $100 for a few rolls and an entree is a bit excessive.'

I can hang with the foodies, understand the lingo and know mostly what they talk about, but I just like to eat. I like to enjoy my food in the more primal sense - eat it, love it, and try to eat more of it.\n\nSo it was here that my lovely and I came to have our first meal of our trip in Vegas. I like Peruvian and Brazilian, she likes Fish and Asian, so hey... bada bing.\n\nWe did a sort of taster/small plates menu, from some sushi, a lambchop which I will call THE WORLDS BEST. Peruvian maize which were the size of freaking lima beans, but oh so good, and... well.. truth be told I can\'t remember all what else. There was some sort of ceviche deal, but after a few DonQ Mojitos, and a lot of drinking that night, I can barely recall all that was had.\n\nBut from what I do remember, it was really really good. Sure, it\'s a fusion restaurant and they either go really really great or you leave less than impressed, but this place really left a good impression on me. The service was wonderful, the exotic drinks weren\'t too sickly in my opinion, and the decor, ambiance, service, and wait were rather agreeable (especially after having driven for 5 hours that day)\n\nPrices weren\'t shockingly "brb, need to hit the craps table for a few rolls" high either.\n\nReally good if you\'re looking for some sort of Asian/South American style cuisine.'

Everyone was stuffed after the fourth dish, but good food kept coming. I am totally hooked on the black truffle aioli that comes with the green bean tempura. The calamari is interesting but good!

I wanted to take a moment to clarify my review lest the masses get the wrong impression given the critical aspects of my opinions.\n\nFirst and foremost, the quality of ingredients, the preparation and the service of the staff was impeccable. I'd like to repeat once more that the staff was excellent -- quick, anticipatory, professional and went out of their way to make our experience welcome and enjoyable.\n\nThey have an amazing list of sake and wine; one I'd like to investigate and sample from more deeply. And the bartender(s) know how to mix drinks -- great tasting, proper ratios and not too strong or weak, just great flavor.\n\nThat the sushi/sashimi was not to my preference should not be misunderstood as not enjoyable to others. The restaurant was still trying to seat a long waiting list well beyond generally accepted dinner hours (perhaps the late night supper club after seeing one of the many shows in Vegas?). The success of SushiSamba is obvious given the strong following and customer base. And I'd like to try their Brazilian offerings. But my preferences for sushi/sashimi, no matter the quality of ingredients, lie with a different style of preparation."

S'Best dinner experience during a recent week in Vegas - equal credits due to food, company, service and the ambiance.\nI loved my lemon samurai - light enough so I could have a perfectly lucid conversation and remember all of it, yet not trivial enough to pass off as a mocktail! The vegetarian roll doesn\'t merit too much reflection, but the plaintains and coconut rice lent a nice Latin infusion to the otherwise bland menu.\nThe ambiance is mighty chic without being uber pretentious like some of the other Palazzo restaraunts. Which means the crowd is about as "normal" as you could get in Vegas! Not abnormal is the pricetag - expensive certainly, but heck, I\'d rather savor a memorable dinner than watch my money vanish on a table on the casino floor!\nOverall, great place to linger, lounge and see and be seen.'

S"What can I saw but wow!  I was recently in Miami Southbeach and visited SushiSamba. Well my friend knew many of the bartenders from being a regular patron. So we definitely got good service! \nWell visiting Las Vegas 3 weeks later I decided to look for a local SushiSamba. Using yelp I found there to be a SushiSamba in Venetian on the strip. I checked their website to verify they were open and found out they had a reverse (late) happy hour starting at 11pm till close.\nSo my friend and I took a cab from Hardrock hotel (probably last time there, thats a whole different story) to Venetian hotel. On arrival I saw the bar was placed in front where there were a few seats available. So we sat down towards the end of the bar and asked if we could eat dinner at the bar. The bartender Mari (Maria)  gave us some menus and we asked for the happyhour menu which had just started. I asked about some of the items on the menu and she was very friendly and informational. My friend was actually not feeling good and she gave him some tonic water and small amount of bitters to help ease his stomach. (which actually helped later on)\nShe ended up getting real busy at the bar but no matter how busy she got she always made sure we got what we needed in a timely manner. She balanced about 10-15 bar patrons orders drink and food wise along with still making drinking for all the waiters ordering drinks for their patrons. I felt she was really efficient and still friendly in demeanor always smiling! I find good freindly custommer service is hard to come by now a days. Kristina the floor manager checked in with us and made sure we were doing ok and that all our needs were meet. Another great show of good customer service. When the managers come up and check in with their patrons I feel they are actually taking interest and want to make sure all your needs are being meet!\nWe had a really good night there so much we decided to go back the following night to see if we could have another good successful night again. Well our expectations were exceeded again. Mari was working again and thanked us for returning and even went out her way to have us try a few things on the menu we didn't even order to ask our opinion. She even made drinks to our specific needs (my friend didn't want that much sugar in his drink) She made it to meet his needs and turned out to still be a decent drink. Mari's good customer service was the best during my stay in Vegas and I was there july 4-9. She far exceeded my expectations and went above and beyond! The floor manager Kristina also sat down with us to talk about customer service and again making sure everything meet our expectations.  I have to recommend SushiSamba, the bartender Mari (Maria) and the floor manager Kristina. 5 stars and i would tell anyone heading to visit to make it a stop for sushi or tapas."

S'I came for a bachelorette party last week on Friday night around 11pm. My review is probably (ok definitely) biased because I was in such a bad mood at having to wait until 11pm to eat dinner. However, as you might imagine, 5 girls using one bathroom getting ready to go out in Vegas is a production equal to Cirque de Solei that takes upward of 3 hours. But whatever we finally made it after a 15 minute, mile long cab ride down the strip from the Cosmo to the Palazzo hotel.  The restaurant was super dark (why don\'t they turn some lights on?) with huge TVs which were super loud. Per the usual at many "sceney" type restaurants you could barely here the people across the table from you. \n\nWe got seated no problem as the restaurant was dead except for two or three big groups getting wasted in booths and a few lonely looking stragglers at the bar. Our server was friendly but seemed to constantly be in a rush, although to go where I do not know. There seemed to be a ton of bus boys but very few wait staff. He could probably sense our frustration so he promptly brought out a wrought iron tree full of pink drinks. Whether or not they had liquor was the only question (Answer: not enough.) So we got a range of drinks, the best of which was a cucumber lime martini with vodka. After the night\'s beginning, I opted with straight vodka and diet coke.\n\nFor food we got a lot. Some  memorable dishes were the Neo Tokyo roll with tuna which was solid, heirloom tomato salad with sweet cilantro dressing, rock shrimp tempura, mushroom tobanyaki, and sweet coconut rice side. My fave dish of all was the heirloom tomato salad which was pricey but enough to share between 3 people. The rock shrimp was good but cliched, same as you would get anywhere else. The mushroom tobanyaki was interesting but not to my taste.  Sadly we did not get dessert. \nIn conclusion, I can definitely say i hope I will never be back with another bachelorette party, although I would not mind returning otherwise.'

Anticuchos, Pisco Sours, Ceviches, tiraditos, rocoto.. I was so excited to incorporate my undying love for sushi along with staples from my country. \n\nI kept mum about being Peruvian but after ordering a Pisco sour and a cusquena for my colleague, the waiter quickly caught on. We did something unusual, and we let the waiter decide our feast for the evening.. and boy was it a feast fit for this pricness right here. \n\nI can't tell you how many rounds of food came.. but they were ALL heavenly. From the ceviches to the makis to the dumplings to the sashimi to the moon and back. It was absolutely wonderful. \n\nWe have several Sushi Samba where I live in Miami.. but it's never the same eating there as it is in the Venetian in Las Vegas.. but then again, nothing is quite like Vegas."

S'Long overdue review.\n\nI really was disappointed because my Mom\'s side of the family are Asian immigrants to Brazil who had lived in South America for decades. I really thought this was going to be Brazilian style Sushi, but it wasn\'t. A lot of people don\'t know this, but Brazil has the 3rd largest population of Asians outside of Asia.  1st being the USA, 2nd being Canada, and 3rd being Brazil.  Did you also know that Brazil has more Japanese residents than the United States? So, I was very excited that a place like this opened up. \n\nI am a big fan of "fusion sushi".  I love new and creative twists on the oldschool style maki, but Sushisamba just doesn\'t do it as well as other sushi restaurants. Sushi is really really popular in Brazil.  And unlike Americans, the Brazilian sushi houses tend to be very traditional. That means that they don\'t really like California rolls or other types of fusion sushi that is popular in America.  But, the menu here is more similar to Ichiro Mashita\'s American style sushi. \n\nSushisamba prides themselves on having "fresh fish", that is of higher quality than smaller sushi restaurants and that is their justification for charging higher prices. But, even places like Sushi Bomb(North West), Sushi on Rainbow(Koreatown), Sushi Twister(Boulder Highway) and even the overrated Goyemon(Southwest) have fresh fish flown in everyday, and some of these places even keep the fish alive in tanks until the day of serving. And they only charge a fraction of what this place does. You know, even the Edomaezushi style Kabuto restaurant\'s prices are lower than this place.  \n\nI guess I\'m just really upset over the fact that they hyped this place up as a Brazilian-Japanese style restaurant and it wasn\'t any of that. It wasn\'t Brazilian cuisine and it really wasn\'t authentic Japanese cuisine. And, I just recently found out that the owner of this place is a guy named Matthew Johnson. That doesn\'t sound Brazilian or Japanese to me. \n\nYou know how a lot of full-blooded Japanese yelpers always complain about how they hate Sushi bars that are owned and operated by non-Japanese Asians and have Latino cooks? Yet, this place is owned by a White man from New York City and we don\'t find those same Japanese Yelpers complaining? Why is that? Someone explain that to me? Where is Alex S and Hootie B??'

S'This place is just off the charts. We mainly ate ceviche and sashimi, they came with such great creative sauces. Service was outstanding and restaurant manager stopped by couple times to make sure we\'re doing fine. While I wasn\'t impressed with tuna (a bit of tuna snob here) I can\'t take any stars from this review. 5/5\n\nBtw, drinks are great too. "Nashi" was such a perfectly balanced one.'

S"One of my favorite sushi experiences everrrr.  I've been here three times on three different Vegas visits and it's always delicious.\n\nOn the last visit, we opted for a tasting menu for a party of 7.  The waiter was selling it pretty hard and we finally gave in.  Pretty glad we did too.  We asked for a lower end menu costing $50-55/head and the kitchen did a superb job.  We were able to taste way more than we would have ever imagined if we were to order a la carte.\n\nEdamame\nRock Shrimp Tempura - (MUST GET)\nYellowtail Seviche Taquitos - (YUM!)\nYellowtail w/ jalapeno and lemongrass taradito (this is the best one)\nKanpachi w/ yuzu sea salt and black truffle oil taradito \nTuna w/ granny smith serrano and lime taradito\nSalmon w/ orange and miso taradito\nFilet Mignon Robato w/ 4 kinds of sauteed mushrooms (YUUUM)\nChilean Sea Bass w/ Miso Sauce anticucho w/ Peruvian Corn (GIANT CORN-delicious fish)\nNeo Tokyo roll\nGreen Envy roll\nEl Topo roll\nPacific roll\nRainbow Dragon roll\n\nDrinks  - overall they have pretty good drinks, and if you are clever enough to score some 2 for 1 coupons, it's worth it!  I like the Samba Juice and the Lemon Samurai. :)"

S'I have been here probably at least 4x over the past year. I have never had a bad experience yet.  Last night my Aunt was in town visiting.  She was staying on the strip at Treasure Island so we decided to grab some sushi at the Palazzo. \n\nThe Otsunami appetizer of edamame, crispy green beans and green peppers is really good! It was the first time I had sea bass skewers based on other yelp reviews and they did not disappoint! For sushi we had Bobo Brazil roll with is kobe beef, the sushi samba roll with the lobster claw and the Lima roll with Spicy King Crab mix. Also if you want a good cocktail the Samba juice is really good!\n\nThey have a busy bar area to have some drinks, a nice sushi bar and a very lively atmosphere inside the restaurant. \n\nThe only downside if i had to give one is the rolls are relatively small for the price. However the quality is high! I would recommend checking it out if you are in the area.'

S'There are plenty of sushi restaurants to choose from in Las Vegas, but if you\'re in the mood for something unique and different, try Sushi Samba.  It looks like a funky nightclub at first glance, but venture inside and you\'ll find a lively restaurant with an eclectic atmosphere and friendly service.  If you\'re looking for a quiet, romantic dinner, this probably isn\'t your place.\n\nStart out with a drink.  The sake list is long and distinguished, sure to satisfy even the most discerning sake drinker.  And if sake is not your thing, they have great signature drinks. Try the Yemenja (vodka, ginger liqueur, lemongrass and mint).\n\nTime to eat!  You\'ll discover the menu is just as eclectic as the ambience, fusing Japanese, Brazilian and Peruvian cuisine.  If you want sushi, they have sushi.  Or if you prefer Brazilian BBQ, they have Churrasco.  But it\'s the smaller more distinct plates that make this place great.   The miso-glazed seabass skewers are a MUST, served with large kernel Peruvian corn, they\'re "melt in your mouth" good.  Also, the Samba Strip roll (lobster, mango, peanut curry) will knock your socks off.  One could return to this spot several times and still not try everything on the menu. In fact, I recommend bringing a large group of friends so that you can sample more of the many delights Sushi Samba has to offer.'

S"Sushi is good.  But our server also had a party of 10 he was waiting on, and he and all his bussers were so occupied with them our party of 3 was ignored.  We asked him for a sake menu when we ordered our food.  No one came close enough to our table for us to flag them down and ask again, until the busser came with our food.  Then we got the menu.  But when the couple at the table next to us had water accidently splashed on them, they made a fuss over them, going out of their way to get the woman's scowl off her face.  Sushi was good, but the price tag was not worth the horrible service."

We ordered a bunch of dishes tapas style - Seabass with peruvian corn, Quinotto, Chicken Anticuchos, Yellowtail ceviche and El topo roll.  Food was pretty flavorful and creative,  being a true fan of peruvian cuisine it was a little off especially the ceviche but seabass with peruvian corn was the favorite all around.  Mixed drinks were great especially the Pisco sours and Caiprinhas.  Overall great place for tapas, most portions are small.'

S"The Sushi Samba in Miami is much better than the LV location all because of the quality of the fish.\n\nSushi Samba Las Vegas had the WORST fish for their taradito. We had the combination platter and the fish was FISHY and TOUGH. We also paid $12 a piece for their Toro (fatty tuna) and it was so tough we needed a knife to cut it. The strings of fat in the tuna were like steak gristle - gross! Our Kampachi was also extremely tough. When we asked our waiter about it, he said it was supposed to be like that? NO WAY!\n\nTheir miso sea bass was really really good but after eating tough fishy fish, my appetite was gone.\n\nI know Vegas is far from the ocean, but come on!!! Don't charge $12 a piece for Toro and then insist that you aren't supposed to be able to cut it with a butter knife.\n\nWill stick to the Miami location! Much more lively, bright and yummy."

We pretty much ordered everything, the spicy rock shrip appetizer was tasty and the beef tartar was good too.  Sushi rolls were so/so, nothing special for the price tag. The best part of the meal was cooking or Wagu/Kobi beef on a heated rock. That meat melted in your mouth.\n\nOverall it was nice to try once, but I dont think I'll ever be back, Sushi Roku in Caesars and Okada in Wynn are by far much better dining locales."

S"I'm visiting Vegas for a week and my cousin took me to Sushi Samba for some good food and conversation.\n\nI feel like I should preface my review by saying that I'm from Hawaii and seeing Larger than Life Vegas decor is rare to see back home. This is not to say there aren't trendy, cool looking restaurants, it's just to say they aren't found on every block in Hawaii.\n\nFirst of all, I dug the atmosphere. Really mellow, a restaurant that looks part modern art gallery, part restaurant, and part trendy graffiti hangout. \n\nThe food was really delicious and I wish I could remember the names of everything I ate. I'm not a big fish person, but I had this miso sea bass and it was sooo good. Just the right amount of flavoring and no fishy taste (which I don't like when eating fish). I also had a butter garlic scallop that just melted in my mouth. \n\nThe service was superb, the manager introduced himself and made sure we had a great time, and the food was delicious.\n\nWe definitely need something like this back in Hawaii. Would definitely go back again."

S'Sorry, SushiSamba, but what happens in Vegas, certainly does not stay in Vegas.\n\nI was recently on a business trip to the Sin City and ate at SushiSamba three separate occasions. The first two were great experiences, but sadly third time wasn\'t a charm. It completely ruined my entire experience.\n\nWhile the sushi was good (certainly not the best I\'ve ever had) I was appalled when my co-worker found a hair in his roll during my third meal there. As soon as he did, we notified our waitress and her reply was "can I get you another roll?" so he ordered a new one. Then she asks, "is it blonde? Because if it is, it may have been mine but don\'t worry I showered this morning."\n\nYelpers, I kid you not.\n\nOH GEE THANKS! Now I can rest assured knowing your dead skin cells that are possibly floating around my stomach were at least CLEAN.\n\nI about died - but instead stuck to eating coconut rice (I didn\'t dare touch a roll). A few minutes later..... another hair.\n\nThis time I stormed up and demanded the manager who questioned us the entire time and seemed entirely unconvinced that there was any hair in either of the rolls. I am sorry, but when a customer is SHOWING YOU a hair in their food, you should probably not question it. She then says, "I just have to check because sometimes it isn\'t hair. Sometimes it is just small shards of chopsticks that look like blonde hair."\n\nAre you kidding me? So now, I should be happy with the fact that it might not be the waitress\' CLEAN blonde hair, but instead a shard of chopstick that could pierce my esophagus?\n\nI have never experienced a more ridiculous restaurant situation in my life. Needless to say I left with the worst impression of the entire restaurant, which is a pity considering the first two occasions went well. Good luck to whoever dines at this place - but don\'t worry, at least the hair in your sushi roll is probably clean.'

S"We came to Sushisamba for my birthday dinner a few days ago and I was blown away by the food! It definitely exceeded expectations.\n\nThe menu was so overwhelming we didn't know where to even begin and while our waiter didn't really help us narrow things down, he did make some good suggestions and helped us pace out the meal so we can order as we go. He came with the manager, who was very nice and gave us birthday shots, and also asked that we let him know if he could do anything. \n\nHere's what we started with: shishito peppers combo (grilled shishito peppers, tempura string beans with a truffle aioli, and edamame), rock shrimp tempura in a spicy mayo sauce, beef gyoza, and crispy scallop lettuce wraps. The peppers were a good surprise of the night because I didn't expect it to come with the string beans and edamame, but I definitely appreciated the greens in Vegas! The rock shrimp tempura was really tasty, but I wish it was a little crunchier when it came out. They tasted a bit soggy as if they were sitting in sauce for too long, but no complaints because the flavor was still there. The beef gyoza was good, but nothing really mind-blowing in my opinion. The crispy scallop lettuce wrap was phenomenal. Our waiter said it was a new item on the menu and suggested we try it and it really blew us all out of the water. \n\nWe followed up the first round with the robata - we got the pork belly, rib eye, sea bass, and duck. All of them were so good, so make sure you pay a visit to the robata section when you visit! The duck and the rib eye to me stood out more than the others - they were cooked very well and had a good mix of unique flavors.\n\nWe finished off dessert with their 4th of July special (red velvet cheesecake, frozen blueberries, and white chocolate ice cream) and sadly we were underwhelmed with what came out. I think we were so blown away by the entire meal, we felt like dessert was going to continue the streak, but were left wanting a bit more. Either way, we were so stuffed it didn't matter and the dessert didn't take away from how much we liked the meal itself.\n\nWhat really set this over the edge is that the chef came out to shake our hands and chat with us really quickly, which I really appreciated! The service was great, the recommendations were on par, and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this spot for a special occasion - go ahead and gorge!!"

S"I've been to other SS's before and this one is no different. Quality eats, quality drinks, and a high price tag (although considering Strip prices, it was semi-affordable). Sat at the bar and picked up 5 rolls and an order of grilled asparagus. All the rolls (tuna, yellowtail, salmon) were fresh and I give them extra love for serving spicy tuna that wasn't ground up tuna bits mushed together with spicy mayo, but actually a tuna roll with spicy mayo on top. Love that. The servers were on top of everything and were on point with the cocktails. \n\nSpeaking of, we sipped on a Chu-Cumber (shochu, Hendricks Gin, elderflower liqueur, freshly muddled cucumber) and although called a 'wuss' by my lady friend for ordering it, it happened to be a well made cocktail. Her Samba Juice (Cruzan raspberry and Watermelon Rums, a\xc3\xa7ai, passion fruit, cr\xc3\xa8me de banana, guava) was good as well. Both run $12. If you're 'stuck' in the Palazzo, def try and hit up the HH specials which look like a fun time!\n\nI'll be back asap for more of the menu and to bump this baby up a star."

S'Sushi Samba has been a hit or miss with yelpers, and here\'s my chance to check them out!  Featuring a special "Election Day Menu" with specialty cocktails and cheap appetizers, it was a perfect opportunity!\n\nDrinks on the menu:\n* Obamarama (blue) for $11 "Svedka Citron, blue curacao apple liqueur, guava, blueberry" - Really good the first time around. Pleasant to look at and just tasty-good.  The guys and gals enjoyed this drink.  The second time I ordered it, there was way too much alcohol though, and not in a good way.  A good cocktail should be enjoyable to drink; I passed the second one off.\n\n* Maverick (red) for $11 "Pearl Vodka, freshly muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, lime, guava" - Served in a martini glass, so a bit more delicate to drink.  Pretty tasty as well. I enjoyed it.\n\nBites to eat:\n* Shishito Peppers ($2) "grilled spicy peppers, sea salt and lemon" - They give you a bunch of these peppers on a plate, and it was okay for me.  I tried one and found that to be good enough.  Didn\'t really care for more.\n\n* Organic Chicken Aji Amarillo Anticucho ($2) - I found the chicken to be okay, but really enjoyed the Peruvian corn that came with the dish.  That was the best part of it.  Our order had one skewer of chicken, but the party next to us had two? Hmm... \n\n* Spicy Crunchy Tuna Roll ($3) - Really good roll!  I liked this a lot and ordered myself another.  I like how they do their spicy sauce here; it\'s more mayonnaise-based.  And the slight crunch is nice too.\n\n* Salmon Avocado Roll ($3) - Pretty simple roll with just salmon and avocado.  But it was fresh fish and good.  I\'m sad I didn\'t order more.\n\n* Mini Chicharron de Calamar ($3) "cornmeal crusted calamari with tamarind sauce, tomato salsa & plantain" - Our friend\'s order came out soggy, so they thought it was gross.  Ours had a better crunch on it, so it tasted better.  It wasn\'t particularly exceptional, it was okay.  I don\'t remember any plantain in my dish though.  \n\n* Japanese Chicken Wings ($4) "teriyaki and sesame" - It\'s hard to go wrong with teriyaki chicken wings, right?  Good, but messy.\n\n* Chilled Oyster Sampler ($4) "ponzu jelly & tobiko with three oysters" - Really fresh oysters with an interesting ponzu jelly.  We were supposed to get another order before we left, so I missed out on more!  Next time!\n\n* Mini Yellowtail Seviche ($4) "ginger garlic and soy" - Reminded me of Hawaiian poke with the dressing.  It was good with the red onions mixed in there, more poke-like than ceviche-like though.\n\n* Crispy Yellowtail Taquitos ($4) "shiso, avocado, roasted corn miso and spicy aji panca sauce" \xc3\xa2" Two different sauces to put over the taquitos, and it was good.  Very messy though as it broke apart after the first bite and was dripping all over my hands.  Our order came with two taquitos, but when our friend ordered it, he only got one!\n\n* Rosca ($9) "homemade doughnuts with hazelnut chocolate dipping sauce" \xc3\xa2" Recommended by our bartender/waitress as her favorite dessert.  Four doughnut holes arrived and they were just okay.  Disappointing for us, and we wished we had chosen another dessert instead.\n\nWe spent the whole time at the bar because there was standing room only at this event.  So, the girl making our drinks also served us.  She was busy but tried her best to make our drinks were full and our orders were in.  (Our drinks were good for the most part except for that second Obamarama we ordered.  But hey, some people like more alcohol in their cocktails!)  I had a bigger problem with the kitchen output and their consistency.  With certain orders coming out, sometimes you got two of something and other times you got one.  Our friend mentioned that we got more sushi in our order than when he ordered it.  (Makes you wonder what happened to the other pieces.)\n\nOverall, we had a decent experience at Sushi Samba.  You definitely can\'t beat the price and the atmosphere is casual, which is nice alternative at a strip hotel.\n\n3.5 stars.\n\nThey also offer a happy hour (Sunday through Thursday from 4 to 7 pm, and then a reverse happy hour from 10 pm to close), available in the bar area only.\n\n(Pics posted, of course!)'

S"Sushisamba would be very good if there weren't so many other better options for sushi on the Strip.\n\nMy wife and I dined at Sushisamba before catching Rock of Ages.  The ambiance is fun but a little busy.  It can be difficult to hold a conversation.\n\nI started out with the red miso soup with mushrooms.  It was way to salty even for miso.  I ordered some sashimi and a sushi roll with foie gras.  It was good but not great.  My wife ordered a bunch of sides (she's pregnant and was craving rice, beans, and plantains all at the same time!).  She complained that the food was a bit too spicy.\n\nWe ordered mochi for dessert.  They were pretty good but standard without anything standing out.\n\nOverall, there are better options for sushi.  The Latin infusion was kind of gimmicky and did not always pair well with the Japanese dishes."

If being surrounded by a room full of beautiful women is not appealing to you, then by all means you should bypass Sushi Samba.  I think I had flashes of falling in love a half dozen times.  \n\nOn to the food... I started out with the robata grill yellowtail.  It was not what I had expected.  Basically I got a charred piece of fish that I had to pick through the bones of, which isn't easy to do with chopsticks.  I wouldn't say the robata grill was a disaster, but I wouldn't order it again.  To the rescue came a plate of the tuna takati.  This was an exceptionally flavorful small plate, and I do mean small.  I think it was 5 small slices of tuna.  A couple of more slices of tuna would have been nice, but the flavor was exceptional.  The topper to the meal was the BoBo Brazil roll.  This roll is something you'd want to photograph before you eat.  The flavor was very good.  I liked the kobe beef on the outside of the roll both for the flavor and the appearance.  Really a very good roll."

S'Pain in the Tanis!  We ate here a few nights ago and absolutely hated it, mostly thanks to our terrible server, Tanis.  She refused to bring us any menus and assured us she would customize a meal for us that we would love... I left hungry.  There were 6 of us total, 2 of us don\'t eat any fish.  We told her that in the beginning when she was refusing to bring out menus.  For our second course, she brought out raw fish for the fish eaters and cooked fish for the non fish eaters... wtf?  I waited around 15 minutes for her to come by again so I could get something different to eat.  When I was finally able to flag her down, I asked if the two non fish eaters could get something non fish, to which she replied, "I brought out two extra fish dishes for everyone else.  There\'s nothing you can eat for this round."  That\'s obviously terrible customer service.  She could\'ve brought us out another two mediocre kobe mini tacos like she brought for us the first round, but she obviously doesn\'t care about her customers experience in her restaurant.  I had also ordered a drink from her which I suspect she intentionally forgot since she knew I was upset with her, it was her way of getting back at me.  When I complained about it to my friend she conveniently was able to hear me that time and asked, "Was there something about another drink?"  I told her I didn\'t want anymore drinks from her because I was not going to play her little immature, power games.  So instead I left the restaurant and walked to a nearby bar, came back to the restaurant and finished my drink there so that she wouldn\'t get anymore of my money.  Tanis is the worst waitress I have every come across in my entire life, and that\'s just after a trip to London, the city of zero customer service.  If Tanis doesn\'t like serving people, maybe she should look for a new job?  Thanks for the memories Tanis, I can\'t wait for you to see this!  :)'

Everything was fresh as well, which left us commenting on how they get such fresh sushi in the desert (I suppose anything can be frozen and transported across half the world these days).  \n\nMy dates cocktail was pretty impressive as well, the cocktail glass lined in sugar.\n\nI'm pretty partial to Asian Fusion, in general, and with the addition of the Brazilian flair, this place is one of the rare few that get my five stars.\n\nIn Vegas style, a pretty swank interior with hanging sculptures, a viewing window of one table, into the mens bathroom, and open and expansive seating area in the back, all come together nicely for a great meal out.\n\nThey're open late night (2AM on weekends) - so a bonus if you're strolling out of Tao a bit early."

S"Interesting mix of cuisine (Japanese, Peruvian, and Brazilian). Sounds like a potentialy disgusting combo, but it actually works very well. Try their signature sushi rolls. They're extremely good. They also have more Sake than Japan it seems. About a 6 page menu to select from. They also have amazing muddled fruit cocktails. \n\nNow, the negatives. As sushi goes, and tapas for that matter, it's slightly pricey. I know it's Vegas, but some things such as sushi just can't go higher than a certain price. The second thing is the fact they have an amazing modern space, but then have a giant screen tv playing football. Why dumb down a hip place. Oh well."

S"Wish I could give this place a 5 because the food is delicious, but unfortunately because of the lousy service I have to give it 3 stars. Went to this restaurant with a few girlfriends on a trip to Vegas. SUPER Excited to enjoy a great sushi meal with people that LOVE sushi. Instead we were greeted by a server, name to be disclosed, who was degrading, rude, and treated us like cheap girls. \n\nOne of our friends requested for a carafe of hot sake and this server immediately said that this restaurant was too high class to have any sort of hot sake. Who was this guy? How does he not know that we're just girls who enjoy drinking hot sake from time to time-this server needs to learn some MAJOR restaurant etiquette! As the night progressed, the service did not get any better. I've been to MANY wonderful restaurants in Vegas where the food was great and the service EVEN better and this restaurant definitely put the standard of Vegas restaurants in the low range. Fortunately the manager hooked my friends and i with some shots that were delicious - one of them included cucumber and was fresh and cool to the taste. \n\nOn the positive note, the food was ridiculously delicious (hoping there wasn't any extra protein hidden in it). The Sashimi dishes with granny apple sauce and another with some sort of lemon grass sauce was soo good! The Chilean Sea Bass was delectable and probably the best dish on the menu. \n\nI always believe that Las Vegas has the best places to eat, this restaurant may be one of them, but I will never go there again unless i confirm that this server is not serving my table. And if anyone from this restaurant is reading this...never underestimate your customers!"

S"In las Vegas as well as other big restaurant/entertainment towns, good food is expected but in Las Vegas it sometimes does not fully compare to Chicago and NY.\n\nHowever, the one place I finally went to was Sushi Samba and what a great surprise.  I tend to avoid sushi in several places when traveling unless in Hawaii and some parts of CA and Japan.  Sushi Samba had some of the best dishes I have had and the quality was great.  They have a variety of menu items with small plates and full entrees.  They do some traditional sushi but mostly more interesting variations as well as the S American dishes.  Some of the items were:\nRock fish\nWagyu Gyoza\nRock shrimp tempura\nGreen bean tempura\nPork belly\nMoqueca Mista. Seafood coconut milk and rice with green onion\nYamato sushi roll(maguro, Fois gras, Osetra caviar)\nUni shushi outstanding \nGreat sake list\n\nAll the fish and shellfish were fresh and well prepared.\n\nIt gets busy so we ate at the bar and the service was excellent there.  Luna and Maria can help with picking some great dishes at the bar.\n\nIt is on the higher price side but worth it compared to a lot of other places where the food doesn't always live up to the expectations in Vegas.  Looking forward to next trip back there."

S'I went here last night (4th of July Weekend) for dinner with my man and 4 friends of ours...AMAZING! Our waitress Tanice was absolutely wonderful and she put together a 10 course meal for my table based on our preferances. Every single thing she brought out was pure delight in your mouth...the scallops with pesto sauce were excellent, these small tuna "tacos" were amazing, and the chilean sea bass skewers were the best fish I have ever had, hands down. All entrees were served family style and the brazilian/sushi flare to the food was exciting for my taste buds. We got a shot tower (12 shots) for our table and the cucumber martini and sangria shots that came on it were super delicious. The manager Liza came over, pleasantly introduced herself, and checked our table frequently to make sure our meal was perfect. This place is a must for some fun, fine dining in Las Vegas. The ambience is dark, red and trendy in a classy way. It also was kinda cool to see Shawn Marion sitting at the table next to us. Come eat here and ask for Tanice and Liza: you won\'t be disappointed.'

I recommend at least $50 but to you your own. They will bring out as much or as quality as you spend. They will ask you your allergies, likes and dislikes and the chefs will create a course for you. Make sure to always get the sea bass skewers. The sushi rolls are just OK but everything else on the menu is way above average. If I can't make up my mind in Vegas to eat, I end up here."

S"Date/Time:  Monday - 10pm\nOccasion:  Vegasaversary dinner after Phantom \nParty of:  Two\nLocation:  Amongst the shoppes in Palazzo.  Interesting decor.  Dark ambiance.\nOrdered:  Roasted Shishito Peppers, Hamachi Tiradito, Miso-glazed Seabass Skewers, Spicy Tuna Roll, Moqueca Mista, and Trio of Sorbet/Ice Cream (green tea, lychee, and vanilla)\nTotal incl gratuity: ~$110\n\nI am so stunned that Sushi Samba (SS) has an overall rating of 3.5!  It definitely deserved a 5 in my book.  Was pretty blown away by all of their food.  I'm not usually that impressed with Asian fusion but they deserve two thumbs up.  We arrived at 10pm and I was expecting it to be rather dead but it was still busy and happening.  All tables occupied, loud music bumping, and servers running around.\n\nThe BF and I decided on a few dishes to share.  Everything on the menu ranged between $10 - $30.  Granted we ordered a number of different items - for variety and sufficiency - we figured our dinner bill would be a little pricey.  Seeing shisito peppers on the menu, I had to go for it.  I don't know what it is about these little things but I love them.  SS serves them grilled with a splash of lemon and seasalt.  A very good and light starter.  It actually went really well with the lemongrass sauce that was served with the hamachi tiradito.  Don't even get me started on that lemongrass sauce. O.M.Gee. I'm pretty sure there was a hint of crack in that thing because I was drinking that stuff.  It was so incredibly delicious.  When the waitress tried to take my plate away, she noticed how much I was savoring each drip of it so she brought me out a ramekin of it.  Naturally I was dipping everything in that sauce.\n\nThe seabass skewers were just as delectable - melted in my mouth with the perfect flavor of miso.  Highly recommend!  We noticed our neighbor ordered the moqueca mista. It looked delicious and we opted for it as well.  It was the perfect entree.  I couldn't have been more pleased.  The seafood was fresh and generous in portion.  The coconut lime flavor was delicious.\n\nSeriously, SS is fantastic  I can't emphasize it enough.  Since I've been back home, I've been telling everyone about this place. No joke!  One can only hope that they'll open one in SF.  I'm headed back to Vegas in a week - making my way back there for SURE!"

S'Sushi was very good along with all of the appetizers. With that being said, I went with a group of about 10 girls and it took 20 minutes after being seated for them to recognize that we were there, and that was after we asked a server walking by. They definitely made up for it with free drinks and appetizers but it was disappointing and it should have never started out like that. From then on the service was pretty good but they ended up forgetting to bring a few dishes out, and somebody found hair in their food. Overall the food was great and they apologized and made up for the wasted time but the experience could have been better.'

S'It is very unfortunate that the Sushi Samba in Las Vegas is the closest spot to the Los Angeles area! Located on the second floor of the Palazzo Hotel, this place takes sushi to a whole new level. It was my last day in Vegas and decided to try it out with some company for lunch. The atmosphere was quite enjoyable! Loved the ambiance. The only bad thing I would have to mention is the lack of service, though it could have been due to the World Cup Finals contributing to the poor service. Nevertheless, this place has DELICIOUS sushi.\n\nCombined total including tip: $100 (4 people)\nOriginality & Taste: 5/5\nService: 2/5\nPrice: $$\n\nSuggested Samba Rolls:\n- El Topo ($14): My favorite. Absolutely delicious! Never had anything like it. Fresh salmon, rectangular-shaped sushi (as opposed to your typical round-cuts), melted Mozzarella cheese & crispy onions toppers\n- Rainbow Dragon Roll ($15): Freshwater eel, mango, red bell pepper, avocado. Need I say more?\n- Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($6): Fresh yellowtail topped with just the right amount of spicy sauce'

Had a couple of rolls which were tasty.  We also tried the Robata grilled caribbean lobster which was also nice.  Had a couple of nice sakes here.  Lots to choose from on the sake menu.\n\nWe dined on a Tuesday afternoon for a late lunch and a late Wednesday for dinner so the place was never very crowded.

S"IT WOULD'VE BEEN 5 STARS BUT THE WAITRESS WAS BITCHY AT FIRST!\n\nBeing a HUGE Sex and The City fan, I had to go to this place.  The decor is captivating and the lighting is perfect.  Red is the dominant hue of the restaurant and it is so pretty.   The location in Ceasars is kind of hidden so we stumbled upon it.  We went at the perfect time, right around 3 or 4 and it was not busy.  However, the place got PACKED!  THEY DECIDED TO PUT A ROW OF 6 OR 7 TABLES EXTREMELY CLOSE TOGETHER SO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE HAVING DINNER WITH COMPLETE STRANGERS ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU.  YOU CAN HEAR THEIR ENTIRE CONVERSATION, BY THE WAY.  Just entirely too intimate for me.  \n\nOur visit started out kinda rocky.  Our waitress lacked time management skills and/or waited on the other tables hand and foot because she thought they would give them a bigger tip, maybe? Dont know!  All I do know is that we sat there for 25 minutes with nothing more than a hello.  So after compaining to another waitress she finally came around.  While we were ordering, our server was more than eager to answer all of my hyper active, anxious and indecisive friend.  \n\nThe menu is a combination of Pervian, Brazillian and Asian fusion.  OOOOOH SO DIVINE!  IT WAS SO HARD TO DECIDE ON WHAT TO CHOOSE.  We finally decided on Sushi and Seabass, miso soup and seaweed salad.  The miso is delicious but I've had better.  My friend ordered the Red Wild mushroom and truffle Miso.  IT WAS SOOOOO DELICIOUS!  But, THE SEAWEED SALAD IS A MUST HAVE TO VEGGIE LOVERS.  Seaweed has a distinct taste of it's own but it is sooo friggin good!  I was so pleasantly surprised.  When to food arrived, I was like a kid in a candy store.  I CANNOT REMEMBER WHAT SUSHI I ORDERED BUT ONE OF THEM THE BEST EVER!  As expected, the food is expensive.   Between the 2 of us, it was well over $100. So don't go here if you are trying to save money.  If you do just order the tapas on the left side of the menu.  But, you will still be hungry.\n\nI loved this place.

S"I absolutely loved eating here. The atmosphere is great, cool decoration. The service was fantastic and our server was very friendly. I would list off everything we ordered, but there were five of us and I couldn't remember the names of half the things we ordered, let alone all the desserts (we ordered 3 sampler platters for dessert, so I'll just stick to a few. My father ordered one of the duck dishes, I don't remember which one since I didn't place the order, but it was fantastic. The duck was perfectly cooked and the sauce was a perfect complement to the natural flavors of the duck. The two rolls we ordered were the Samba Strip and the Bobo Brazil. The Bobo brazil was absolutely phenomenal. The seared kobe inside was of great quality and worked very well with all of the other ingredients. The Samba Strip was very different for me, as I had never had a roll with Lobster and was a little unsure, but I'm glad we went with it! I loved the way the peanut curry worked with the mango and the texture of the lobster. The most memorable part of the night, by far, was ordering the dessert. My girlfriend is from Brazil and one of her absolute favorite things is Brigadeiro. She was ecstatic to see it on the dessert menu in one of the dishes, because it is difficult to find a place that makes Brigadeiro (good or not aside, there just aren't many places that have it), especially where we live (AZ). She asked our server if she could just get a small plate of Brigadeiro by itself for dessert, and the server he would have to check with the chef. Here, though, they went a little above and beyond for me. Despite the Brigadeiro being listed only as an ingredient in a dish, the chef said that they would make a plate by itself, just for us. However, the chef wanted to inform us that it was not traditional brigadeiro, and even prepared a small sample for us to try before ordering a plate so that we wouldn't be disappointed if we were hoping for the traditional stuff. I can't find fault with service like that.\n\nOn a side-note, they have a dish that is cooked on a hot stone and comes out sizzling on that hot stone. I have no idea what it was called, but it was ordered repeatedly by other tables and smelled absolutely phenomenal. I would go back just to sit at the bar and be able to smell that dish being brought out to other tables."

Here is what i ordered:\n\nMiso Encrusted Sea-bass robata; Duck robata; Hamachi jalapeno and lemon grass; Tuna Tataki; Hamachi ceviche\n\n     Of Everything, the Sea-bass was THE BEST- Hands down. Probably the best I've ever had.  The waiter happened to recommend the sea-bass over the scallops for taste & portion size. Good call on his part, showing me that the staff is educated and willing to make suggestions.  The Hamachi and lemon grass was great.  Tuna Tataki- was OK, not great, not bad, The Hamachi Ceviche was tasty as well. \n     Friends suggested the Peruvian Plate- enough for two, but i was too interested in the menu selection to choose otherwise. He DID goto SushiSamba a bit after me, and ordered it again, so it must be worthwhile.\n     Overall it was a GREAT dining experience. I will DEFINITELY be back for more.

S"So we were headed to Bouchon, but they closed at 1 for lunch/breakfast. To be honest, we didnt really expect to be on time anyway. It is Vegas after all: people dont necessarily keep regular hours, our circadian rhythms were thrown off to say the least. Anyway, the place was really cool, i loved the ambiance, the art on the walls and the designs. The place was a bit dim, but I wouldn't classify it as romantic or dark. There were families, younger(us) and and middle aged people so its not a party place where you would do saki bombs(there are enough of those in Las Vegas), nor do you have to wear a suit & tie to come in. \nThe appetizers were delicious! the side sauces accompanying them were equally great. Each roll comes with 6 pieces, which was perfectly sized, the one roll that stuck with me was El topo, that one was really tasty. Friends of mine tried the wild mushroom soup--they were really happy with their choice. The price was very reasonable too. I'd definitely give this place a try if you are in the mood for some Sushi."

S"Favorite new place on the strip in Vegas! We first got there and was placed at possibly the worst table in the place- right near the bar and 5 inches from the next couple. However, it was New Year's weekend and everyone was desperate to even get in, so we got over this minor negative in a hurry. Our server, Justin, more than made up for the bad seating. He was knowledgable and gave great suggestions as to what to try. We diced on letting the chef bring us a sampling of his creations. Boy, what a gift!"

That was the most delicious thing I had ever had!\n\nMostly, my beef with this place is the location, in a mall, and the ambience of the place.  The ironic part is that when you are dining at the Chicago or Miami locations, it feels like you are in Vegas: swanky, cool, fun.  But dining in the Vegas one feels like you are at a Legal Seafoods in suburbia.\n\nJust misses something.  If you're in Vegas, go someplace else."

S'You want to be hypercritical of the place, given the scathing remarks Colicchio throws at the Top Chef contestants.  But then you realize he\'s the head judge for a reason.  Craftsteak was a precision performance, reminiscent of the Blue Angels, executed expertly from beginning to end.\n\nThe hostess was able to accommodate our last second switch from party of two to party of four.  No problem.  No delay.  It was as if they were expecting it.  The table had already been set for four.\n\nOur waiter and his assistant (Eric and Franciscio--how often do you remember the names?) were top notch, ensuring us a well timed courses.  Our water glasses never approached empty.  Details.\n\nOur group decided on the special prix-fixe/tasting menu they happened to be offering.  For $75 per person ($105 with three wine pairings), we were treated to family style service of a variety of fantastic dishes.\n\nThe starter was a lobster bisque, which was superb.  I\'m not exactly sure what the seasoning was, but it might have been saffron, and just enough of a hint at that.  There were just enough pieces of lobster so that it was not too heavy as a starter.  Delicious.\n\nThe next course included Caesar salad, roasted peppers, and prosciutto.  Yum, yum, and yum.  We knew by then that we were in for something special.\n\nMain dishes:  Sliced Kobe sirloins, a marinated skirt steak, seared scallops, with sides of sweet potato puree, fried artichokes, and creamed spinach.  This is where we turned into savages, ate with our hands, and communicated in snorts and groans.  Everything was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly, portioned perfectly.\n\nI cannot tell you what the four dessert samplings were.  I remember them being brought to the table.  I remember they looked nice.  I remember spoons.  Chocolates, creams, fruits.  It\'s all a dream to me now.  Colicchio mentioned the importance of a good dessert on last night\'s episode (restaurant wars) and I now know that he is a man of his word.\n\nYou might balk at spending $210 for two people for a "tasting" menu, but you definitely get your money\'s worth with this menu.  There was more than enough food to go around.\n\nThis will go down as one of the great dining experiences of my life.  As I lay in bed later that night, the best kind of indigestion interrupting my sleep, I thought about how difficult it must be to achieve this level of perfection.  And I thought, you poor, poor Top Chef contestants--good luck to you!'

S"This review pertains to the Restaurant Week Prix Fixe for $50.10.\n\nThe Skinny: solid steak house, good sides, pretty good desserts - however issues with serving sizes (4), service: great, warm and friendly (4), value: the prix fixe menus are the thing to get here... a la carte is very pricey and I wouldn't recommend it (3).\n\nWe used to hit Craftsteak when it was still just Craftsteak. The prix fixe menu was around $50-60 per person and pre-Top Chef fame. The reason why we loved it was the quality, the variety and the reasonable cost. Since then, they've steadily raised the prices to around $80/person which is way overpriced (plus they changed the beef to black angus... it used to be kobe.)\n\nSo we returned for Restaurant Week for it's more reasonable price point at $50.10/person. We had 5 people at our table and we were quite pleased by the spread.\n\nService was quite prompt, warm and efficient. Our server was pleased that we had come in for the Restaurant week event and was eager to help us use our vouchers for free drinks. The manager did stop by to greet us and ensure we were having a good time.\n\nWe were served the grilled quail, shaved fennel salad, persian cucumber/watercress salad, mozzarella salad for appetizers. This was followed by prime flat iron steak, grilled angus skirtsteak, sweet corn, yukon potatoes, scallops with the lemon vinaigrette and a dish of baby shitake mushrooms. (for more details, please see the above pics).\n\nThe grilled quail was tender, perfectly seasoned and absolutely delicious. As were all three of the starter salads. We actually received two dishes of the mozzarella salad although we would have preferred more of the fennel salad. Along with the piping hot butter pan rolls, all the flavours of the food worked together beautifully.\n\nThe two beef dishes were well-executed and I loved the springs of fresh thyme. The scallops had a wonderful caramelization on both sides.The corn was fabulous as always and we were given two dishes of this. \n\nAlthough I really like the flavours of their Yukon Gold potatoe puree, I do like my potatoes to be a little less soft (albeit it's a puree... right? but still a little texture would be better). The shitake mushrooms were a very small serving size considering that this dish was to be shared amongst 5 of us. Same goes for the potato puree.\n\nWe had two rather large servings of skirtsteak and flat iron prime with relatively smaller portions of sides. I think I would have like more sides rather than so much beef.\n\nDessert consisted of five separate dishes: a peach pavlova, a chocolate panna cotta, a molten chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream, monkey bread with banana ice cream and a traditional cheesecake.\n\nOf the 5 desserts, the monkey bread and the molten chocolate cake were my favourite. The warm monkey bread had a rich cinnamon, nut topping and was perfectly paired with banana gelato. The molten chocolate cake was moist on the outside, runny on the inside - just the way it's supposed to be.\n\nThe chocolate panna cotta was a little too firm texturally. While I did like the peach sorbet on top of the pavlova, the pavlova itself was a little too thick and thus felt very hard overall. The cheesecake was good but nothing special.\n\nIn essence, this is simple food is done right. The only problems were the proportions of the side dishes and some issues with the desserts. This results in a 4 star review.\n\nI have to say, for $50, it's a good deal but certainly not $80ish as it normally is. Because we did the Wet Republic event, we got 30.10/person voucher plus a coupon for a free drink each. So overall, we paid $30ish per person (including tax and tip). It was great seeing our bill at the end."

S"Overall, an okay experience. I was really torn trying to decide which of the many steakhouses in Las Vegas to visit. I think on my next trip though, I probably will not make a stop at Craftsteak. The food is definitely good, but not quite on par with other steakhouses in the area. When we first arrived, we had a reservation, and it wasn't particularly packed, but they still asked us to wait. We waited in the bar for a while, but it got pretty warm, so we decided to step outside. When we stepped outside, the manager up front said good bye to us, and we had to tell him that we weren't leaving, and that we were waiting to be seated. He kind of looked surprised, and within a minute or so, asked us to follow him into the restaurant. Not a great start, but we didn't really mind - just a little strange. \n\nThe food was good, but again, nothing special. We both ordered the ribeye, and although they were in the pan, we found that the steaks got cold rather quickly. The sides that we ordered were also nothing out of the ordinary. I did however, enjoy my Caesar salad. I thought the presentation with whole leaves of lettuce unsliced and whole anchovies on top was kind of cool and tasty. And of course, the monkey bread was fantastic.\n\nBut once inside, the service was great, and the decor was nice. I found it to be more casual than other steakhouses, but it was a nice environment nonetheless. \n\nPersonally, I thought it paled a bit to our next stop at Delmonico...if you need a comparison."

S'Ambiance was stunning and romantic... we were celebrating being newlyweds... when we arrived we had a handwritten letter congratulating us from the staff. Service was divine. HOWEVER... we can\'t give 5 stars for our experience. We also have a feeling that Mr. Tom would not have been exactly pleased with the way some of our items came out.  The side of potato\'s weren\'t cooked enough. they were still hard in the center... the seasoning was delish... so we are sure that if fully cooked... they\'d be great.  Steak was fine... We liked our Ruth\'s Chris experience better. The "warmed plates" and skillets, were not very warm, and our steaks were quickly chilled. The sweet potato side was cinnamon-y goodness!! \nThe cocktails... Raspberry Martini and the Agave Martini were to DIE for... The Bartender\'s better work it!!!!!! We were surprised with a comp\'d dessert cause of our nuptials... and the Dessert Chef... WOOOOOHOO!!!! The vanilla bean cheesecake melted in our mouths... and it even said CONGRATS on the plate.\nSo... the ingredients to our main meal were great... we just don\'t think they were executed the best possible. Maybe the Chef that night?? Who knows...'

I compared it to the bone in rib eye and both had different flavors and texture.  The only bad part of the meal was ordering wine at this joint.

S"$20,000 for a bottle of wine. I didn't order it, but I wish I could. So I settled for the $11,000 bottle of wine. I'm probably kidding though.\n\nEverything about this restaurant was superb. I shared a 32 oz Porterhouse ($92) with 2 other people. We also got the Puree (mashed potatoes). This was more than enough for the 3 of us. We don't eat that much though, so don't think that with 32 oz will always feed 3 people. From these 2 items, the bill was $140 (after tip/tax). The steak was one of the best I've ever had. Its presentation was good and they even included the bone with the edible marrow inside it--legit.\n\nAnyway, be ready to spend money here. While the food/service is exceptional, so are the prices."

We also got seated in the bar area where they have a few tables with weird couch-type seating on one side. Anyway, it was Friday night and crowded but we had reservations after seeing Ka. Bread was good but not to die for like folks said. We ordered kobe skirt steak, angus filet, corn, potato puree, and mushrooms. Steaks good but not worth price they charge -- I get better beef a our local Beef Palace in Huntington Beach (look it up for best steak in OC). Corn and puree pretty tasty but the mushrooms tough, dry and rubbery..c'mon $15 bucks for that crap. BTW, we sat before the two parties on either side of us and they got served first. Wasn't too thrilled to have all the bar folks standing up behind me while I ate. \n\nGood gracious, I should've gone and tried Vic Anthony's.

S'Blog for full review of food - as this was a comped return visit I higlighted the service issues here.\n\nAs previously stated, after complaining to the GM (at that time a Mr. Jason Bartucci) with hopes that future visitors would not deal with such service we were provided a profound apology and an offer to refund the cost or to come back for a compensatory meal on the house - at the time I declined these options but on further review, a year after many fine dining experiences, I reconsidered.  In a city with so many great options I would not generally be the sort to \'forgive and forget,\' but returning with my two friends - both who love steak - and remembering how good the food was I made contact with the restaurant through the MGM website.  While Mr. Bartucci (and our server) had apparently since been dismissed from the restaurant, my e-mail was answered by the new General Manager, Sebastien Vallet, who invited the three of us back for the chef\'s tasting with wine pairings on the house. \n\nTaking our seats we were almost instantly met by Mr. Vallet, a gregarious and friendly man in a great looking grey suit (vastly differing from the black/white clad servers,) who promised us a fantastic meal and confirmed that I did not eat beef while my friends most certainly did.  \n\nWithin moments our waters were filled - bottled water without even requesting, and our server and his assistant came to our table to once again confirm likes, dislikes, and anything we may need.  In order to not belabor service issues too much I will note a couple of issues here that, despite their obviously being overly attentive to our table, were less than impressive.  First, while Sebastien stopped by multiple times, our server spent vastly more time at a table of well clad businessmen while the assistant served as our primary server throughout.  While not "unfriendly" our assistant\'s grasp of the English language was poor at best, wines were not described as presented, and this was officially the only restaurant on my trip to Vegas where I had to fill my own water.  Another service issue presented itself later, but otherwise I have to say the team clearly "went out of their way" to please us - yet despite that fact, the service at Mastro\'s, CUT, Carnevino, and myriad other fine dining establishments vastly outpaced Craftsteak - their "average" being better than Craftsteak\'s "best."\n\nBrowsing around the restaurant I was amazed at how many hockey jerseys were present - clearly not the "business casual" Craftsteak desires.  Arriving from our assistant server without any description (approximately 1 minute later our main server showed up to tell us what the dishes were) our mains and sides were served with a red wine of which I\'m unfamiliar and neither myself nor JT enjoyed - Brad thought it was decent.  Featuring mains of a 16oz Ribeye, a 12oz Skirt, and Divers Scallops with Fennel and sides of Yukon Gold Potatoes, Sweet Corn, and Wood Roasted Asparagus this is where the other service issue came up.  As previously noted, I don\'t eat steak - that doesn\'t mean my buddies do not eat scallops.  Featuring only five scallops (we received three of the exact same dish as an appetizer last visit) and my friends each deserving to try at least one I explained to our server that this wasn\'t acceptable and, surprisingly, met some resistance - apparently my thin frame made him think I can\'t eat.  Asking if any other fishes were available I was told only tuna - again the same prep I\'d had last year (there was lobster, I saw it on another table, but clearly they weren\'t giving this away) and inquiring about birds or pork I was told only chicken (I know they had duck and pork loin, I saw the nightly menu) so I requested the chicken.  Consenting, begrudgingly, the server asked if we wanted anything else and I emphatically stated some mushrooms would be nice.  While it took about 15 minutes to prepare, the dishes were indeed brought by yet another server - someone who actually smiled (aside from Sebastien.)\n\nMyself - I was pleased with the food again, but still less than sold on the service given the fact that they were clearly "doing their best" and still seemed a little less than in-step with other restaurants of their caliber.  When it was all said and done Mr. Vallet stopped by to see how everything had been and I told him it was good - because it was.  It simply wasn\'t "great."  Leaving a nice tip for our service team (perhaps had they known we\'d be leaving a good tip the primary server would\'ve been more available) we made our way out of Craftsteak for the last time.  Impressed enough that I plan to check out Craft the next time I\'m in Los Angeles or NYC, Vegas has plenty of other options in the meats market and if I were attending repeats I\'d head to CUT or Carnevino first.'

S"I suppose that I have some explainin' to do, considering that my group of 3 friends and I dropped $500 on dinner here yet only gave it 3 stars. \n\nSo, let me start with the sides. We tried the Hen of the Woods mushrooms, gold yukon potato puree and asparagus. The hen of the woods mushrooms were quite good, but nothing I can't put together myself. They had no great sauce, no POW factor. The gold yukon potatoes were fine - nice potatoes that were boiled and pureed to baby-food texture. No special or unique flavors going on there. Finally, I'm convinced the asparagus was just microwaved in some water. Very poor effort there, guys. Considering each of these dishes was $15-$25, I'm very disappointed. \n\nNow, onto some better things. I had the lobster bisque which was very good. Nice and creamy with succulent chunks of lobster. The only complaint I have, if it even counts, is that they served me a ton. It was very rich and I didn't have a cup of bisque, it was a giant bowl. \n\nOn to the most important thing, which were the steaks. My friends ordered the 16oz Ribeye, 16oz New York Strip, 12oz Hanger and I had the grade 8 12oz wagyu beef skirt steak. They were all really, really good but I have mixed feelings here. Sure, they were cooked perfectly, but I can do that at home on my grill. No sauces here, nothing; just pure steak goodness. It was my first time ordering the wagyu beef, and it was good, but I actually preferred the Hanger of the four steaks we ordered. \n\nOverview: The service was impeccable. The wine list was extensive (however out of our price range, at $125 per person without drinks). Though the steaks and bisque were great, the sides were eerily reminiscent of my grandmothers (terrible) cooking. I think Craftsteak is a poor value for your buck, therefore I'll give it 3/5 - A-OK."

Their steaks are all pre-cut when they bring it out, it might be a personal preference but I like cutting it myself. \n\nWe weren't too impressed with any of the sides and for dessert you have to try the monkey bread. You'll never be able to get something like that anywhere else.\n\nAll in all it's a great place for a great meal."

S"My husband and I decided last minute to go to Vegas on leap day in 2008 to get married.  On the drive to Vegas I booked a room at the MGM.  We arrived at the hotel in the early afternoon and then headed out to get a marriage license and get married.  When we returned to the hotel we were starving and not sure where to eat we decided on Craftsteak.  We put in a reservation and were reminded of a dress code for men.  It wasn't an issue because we were already dressed nicely, afterall we had just gotten married.  Anyway, we arrived on time and were quickly seated.  To our surprise, however, there was a man in the booth next to ours wearing shorts and a football jersey!  I think someone forgot to remind him of the dresscode.  The place was very dim, almost to the point where you couldn't see what was in front of you.  But we were in a great mood and didn't really think much about it until much later (months later in fact).  We ordered the 32oz porterhouse for 2, fingerling potatoes, bernaise sauce, and the warm frisee salad, which I don't think is on their menu anymore.  We also got a few drinks.  The porterhouse was brought to us already sliced into bite size cubes and then pieced back together again, which was nice.  It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The potatoes were delicous as well as the bernaise, which by the way I have yet to find a bernaise sauce that tasted as good at theirs.  Also very good was the warm frisee salad which had some thick pieces of bacon in there.  I checked out their current menu and unfortunately I don't see it there so that sucks.  My husband and I have been to a number of other steakhouses hoping to find a place that tops this but have yet to find one.  The food here was very good, but the price was up there.  It was about $250 for the 2 of us!  I can't recall if that included the tip or not, but I have a feeling it didn't because we both had a couple drinks each.  We'll definitely be coming back here again.  In the meantime we'll continue to look for a steakhouse in L.A. that compares."

S'I ate here the evening of Friday, January 27th and enjoyed the best meal I have ever had in my life, so far.  The service was awesome and the food was even better.  \n\nWe started with two each of the Daily Oysters.  My husband had the 14 oz. Domestic Wagyu Ribeye and I dined on the Black Sea Bass with Black Trumpets (amazing).  We shared the Hen of the Woods Mushrooms and Heirloom Cauliflower with Garlic Confit.  For dessert another visit to my favorite of the Daily Oysters, the Fanny Bay.  I would have changed NOTHING about this meal.  It was perfection!\n\nThank you Craftsteak for a wonderful evening......'

S"I'm drooling on my keyboard as I remember the wagyu skirt I had this weekend...by far, the best piece of steak ever, and I've had a lot of steak! I actually ordered the rib-eye, which was delicious, but my husband, at our server's suggestion, ordered the skirt. I wasn't too sure about skirt steak at such a fine steakhouse, and was shocked to learn how good it can be. We were actually blessing the cow. I ended up leaving (sadly) more than 14 oz's of my 16 oz rib-eye behind cause I couldn't get enough of the moist, flavorful, amazing, melt-in-your-mouth tender wagyu skirt steak. Yummmo!!!! The mashed potato puree and roasted corn, also amazing. We've eaten here several times, and have always been impressed. The service is impeccable, the ambiance is relaxed and cool, the blue-cheese olive martinis are to-die-for, the dinner rolls are sooo yummy...I could go on... After one bite, I was no longer disappointed that we couldn't get reservations at Prime...which is also great, but not any greater than Craft, unless of course you want a more stuffy-elegant experience."

Also had the whipped potatoes and the assorted mushrooms. Outstanding wait staff. They made sure the food was perfect. They also sent over a little happy birthday message on our dessert for my husband. Best steak and lobster I have ever had!"

S'Craftsteak is the absolute best way to start off a weekend in Vegas. High class all the way, I have never felt more under-dressed but the staff was so cool Victor, Edgar, and Oscar were on point.\n\nWe started off with a round of drinks, I figured sense we are in Vegas I should have a Nevada brew. The Tenaya Creek IPA was excellent along with the grilled calamari. My lady got the surf and turf while I got the dry aged T-Bone for our entree. Everything was cooked to perfection, that T-Bone steak with the filet and the skirt steak melts. baby spinach and roasted asparagus to compliment all that beautiful red meat.\n\nTheir beer and wine selection was fantastic, I believe they have over a 1000 different bottles to choice from. I also enjoyed the Dogfish 60Minute IPA on tap. To top off the night the table shared their infamous Cinnamon monkey bread and the strawberry shortcake. The atmosphere is wonderful, one of the best meals of my life.'

S'We went to craft steak mainly because I had Ka tickets and wanted to eat some place close. Craftsteak fit the bill. Plus it came highly recommended from a few co-workers so we decided to try it. We had 6 pm reservations. When we checked in, we were immediately seated. The ambiance was elegant and quiet, perfect for a fancy dinner. We decided we weren\'t going to stuff our faces too much so we skipped the appetizers. I ordered the surf & turf with scallops and an 8 oz filet mignon. The steak was perfectly cooked and so tender but still retains its "beefiness." The scallops were exceptional. Not over cooked and served with a lemon butter sauce. My friend and I split a side of risotto. I still dream of that risotto. Very rich and heavy with peas and prosciutto. Part of me wanted to stop eating my streak and just eat the risotto. \n\nService here was excellent as you would expect from Mr. Colicchio. And the other thing worth raving about is the bread! Salty, sweet, bread. This restaurant far exceeded my expectations.'

S"Absolutely first rate service at this place.  Ribeye was solid, though not one that I am going to talk about for the next six months, and the sides were very good.  The malbec didn't go with the meal as well as I had hoped it would, but I forgot how hard that can be to pair with food.  I didn't realize the sides would be as salty as they were.  That meal needed something like a pinot noir.   My wife had the sea scallops and she absolutely loved them.  The staff recommended the monkey bread for dessert, and they sure were right on that one.  I paired it with a glass of madeira, and that was a homerun.  I got that one right, anyway.\n\nI would give this place 4 1/2 stars if it let me.  I can't give it five, though.  It is a great dining experience.  Next time, I am going to splurge on that Kobe skirt steak."

S"I had such high hopes for this place, and it was NOT worth the money.\n\nWe were there for a business dinner and we were a little embarrased we took our clients there.  \n\nFirst of all the warm frisee salad I got was heavy, heavy on the blue cheese.  I love blue cheese but it was a little too much even for me and boring.  The other people's salads looked like just a lot of quantity and not a lot of quality.  Pretty boring.  \n\nI ordered the filet mignon and it was DRY.  The sauce on it was a little strange too with a star anise type flavor to it.  Another person ordered the T-bone, same thing.  Very dry.  We were so looking for a tasty juicy steak.  \n\nLastly the service was meh.  There seemed to be a slight attitude and I didn't feel very welcome.  \n\nOverall, among all the steak houses I've been to, this place was a huge disappointment.  I would not go back there for the steak.  With all the competition in Vegas, this place was all hype and no quality."

S'Meh. Overpriced, nothing special.\n\nMy husband and I ate here on our anniversay. We ordered the wagyu ribeye, t-bone, scalloped potatoes, asparagus and risotto. We did not receive the wagyu, but a standard ribeye.\n\nThe ribeye was nothing special. It was good, but hard to justify the price. \nMy husband\'s t-bone wasn\'t any better than the $9.99 special you can get from numerous casinos around town. The asparagus and potatoes were okay, but again, nothing special and overpriced. The risotto was a mistake! Not only was it covered in mushrooms (not in the description), it didn\'t "spread" on the plate...Instead, it was gummy.  I\'ve watched Top Chef numerous times and Tom Colicchio ALWAYS complains about risotto that doesn\'t spread! Though he did not cook it for us, his name is attached to this restaurant.\n\nOveral, the food was okay, but the price was too high. If you want better steak, head to Vic & Anthony\'s in the Golden Nugget. The steaks are similar in price, but MUCH better and the sides are more reasonably priced...and tastier.'

S'I brought my parents here while they were in town, and just like all the other times, it was perfect!\n\nWe ordered the Wagyu tasting menu, and enjoyed every bite, as always.\n\nWhat further solidifies Craftsteak as a 5 star steakhouse for me is what happened during our experience.\n\nMarvin, our waiter and the wine steward was fantastic.  He helped us pick out some very nice cabernet Sauvignon.  When we told him we weren\'t sure what we wanted, he brought a few bottles and poured us "healthy" tastings.  He was knowledgable and friendly, and found us a perfect pairing.\n\nWe had asked that some of our unfinished delicious be wrapped as they cleared our plates.  At the end of our meal, another server came to our table and told us the following:  "There was  a mixup and your to-go food was thrown out, so the chef prepared everything you had fresh."  We were given brand new food neatly prepared and packaged, they handled the situation perfectly.\n\nCraftSteak continues to be one of the best restaurants in town.'

S'Im a fan of Tom and suggested this place to our group of 6 but what a disappointment. The restaurant was uncomfortably cold. My beet salad had too many, esthetically pleasing, flavorless beets. My steak was not hot and my girlfriends was overcooked. (rare came out medium..) All the meat felt like it had been waiting too long to be served and the sides were also limp and only average. The service was slow and didnt have the professional touch I enjoy at other steakhouses. Maybe because we were seated at ten pm but its Vegas and at $125 per person for a table of 6 they could have treated us better! When the tip is included why does the service always suck?? We all agreed the food court would have made more sense..'

S'Came back for another tasty Craftsteak meal. The food was good but the service was atrocious. We were seated and told our server that we had a show to get to in 2 1/2 hours. We were assured this would not be an issue. We immediately ordered (since we knew precisely what we wanted) and thought this would be a quick in/out since it was not particularly busy. Long story short.....we arrived at our show late. The drink refills came slow, food came out slow, and we waited for our ticket for what seemed like an eternity. I am only knocking off one star because the food was still tasty (but not as tasty as I had remembered it being). \n\nWe will give it another try the next time we are in town but perhaps we will do it after a show!'

S"I loved it here! \n\nHere's what I would suggest though --- MGM Grand has this great VIP program called Prima. If you're willing and able to, you pre-pay $500 when you check in, and you can use that $500 towards food, drinks, etc., and you get pretty great discounts like 2 for 1 entrees, 2 for 1 drinks, etc.\n\nSo...what my boyfriend and I did was splurge on the $100 wagyu steak, but it was 2 for 1 =) They did kind of over-cook one of the steaks, so they gave us two, free desserts which was cool. All in all, our meal was supposed to cost over $300, but we spent about $180-ish for two Wagyu steaks, 2 sides, and 2 glasses of wine."

S"There were both high and low points to this meal.  I think my husband and I have decided Tom may have to pack his knives and go.  The food was good, but when you consider the price for the food you're getting it definitely wasn't worth it.  And considering the dent in our wallet, we both felt it was definitely lacking.  We both did the dinner menu based around the type of meat you choose.  We had the kobe, which may have been better if we weren't so incredibly stuffed from the appetizers.  Highlights were the kobe beef tartare, the frisee salad and the cucumber salad.  Don't bother with the prawns, they weren't very tasty.  The kobe was good, but once again I don't think we cared much considering how full we were.  The sides with the meat were meh - pomme puree (crappy next to Joel Robouchon), wild mushrooms and grilled brussel sprouts.  Honestly, i can't even recall what we ate for dessert so it couldn't have been that spectacular.  Do yourself a favor, save your money and eat elsewhere."

S'pretentious, is how I felt they seemed.  I asked about the salt on the bread rolls(which were great), and it was a salt I liked, I asked to have some for my steak, the waiter told me the reason there was no salt or pepper on the table is the food is already seasoned to perfection.  PLEASE, your taste and my taste are not the same.  I asked about sauce and got the same answer,  I ordered souffle for dessert and it was very dry and the waiter, didnt ask me if I wanted him to pour my sauce on it.  The ice cream that can with it, was awful.  I wont be back.'

S'Now I\'m just showing off. \n\nAlmost every fine-dining restaurant I passed in Vegas featured a "summer" (read: recession) special, usually in the form of a fixed price menu. Craftsteak\'s did not disappoint. $60 per person (pre-tax/wine) gets you not one selection from every course but a family-style meal where every single item on the special menu is served during each course. \n\nHere were the standouts: \n\nCourse 0: Um...the bread is glazed with butter and covered in sea salt. Even my annoyingly health-conscious dining companion who doesn\'t eat butter or carbs ate butter and carbs. \n\nCourse 1: I rarely exclaim aloud at good food anymore, but the quail got an "oh wow" from this relatively jaded foodie. This was the best course in my opinion- the cucumber salad and the fennel salad were both excellent and my friend puts his vote in for the fresh mozzarella. \n\nCourse 2: Oh diver scallops, I\'d eat you for the rest of my life if I could. No, really. The two other dishes, both steak, were solid if unremarkable. Cooked to my instruction on the rare side, which I appreciated. \n\nCourse 2b: Um, there were sides? The corn salad was good, but I could not fathom eating any more at this point. My friend gladly ate all the mushrooms, so I infer his recommendation. \n\nCourse 3: Sigh, is anything more disappointing than digging into what you think is a blueberry crisp only to find that it is rhubarb? I\'m not a fan of rhubarb solo (look, it\'s like putting celery with sugar into a pie!), but the crisp itself was nice and topped with a wonderful homemade vanilla. The other dessert was a chocolate cake and a chocolate mousse covered in solid. dark chocolate. \n\nA wonderful glass of malbec ($13) helped the meal (and bill) go down nicely. \n\nWonderful service, wonderful food, wonderful deal. If you\'re in Vegas soon, check to see if that restaurant you\'ve been eying has become slightly more affordable.'

S"Well, like others have said, this was a VERY disappointing experience.  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!\n\nI love Tom and have been wanting to come here since I heard he had a restaurant in Vegas.  However, service was awful.  Others have said this as well.  My waiter took forever to come over and take my drink order, and forever to come back to take my food order, and i had to practically flag him down throughout the meal whenever i need anything like, i don't know, a pesky refill.  Pissed me off really, because, as usual, I was dining alone, and i felt like I was being ignored somewhat for this reason.  What, you don't think you'll get as big of a tip?  Because I noticed he was really friendly with some of his more populated tables.  Plus, I had a relatively early dinner reservation, and there was no reason for him to take a hundred years to return to check on me, since the restaurant was not full when I was there.\n\nAnyway, in addition to the service, i was highly disappointed in the food overall.  I ordered the Wagyu filet - I think.  It might have been the Kobe filet mignon.  See, that's evidence right there how terrible it was because I LOVE cow and I can't even remember what I ate here.  All I know is it was a filet since that's all i order and it was ~$125 for 10 ounces or so, a la carte.  Now, I ordered it well done, and that may have been part of the problem, because other posts have mentioned getting the steak at medium or medium rare doneness.  I understand that you preserve the taste of the meat this way, especially with really expensive cuts, but I personally prefer not to hear Moo's or have my dinner walking off my plate, so I'm sticking to fully cooked.  To me, the mark of a great steakhouse is whether they can properly cook a steak well done and leave it juicy, and in the case of filet mignon, i feel like butterflying it is cheating.  But i digress.  I ordered the damn steak well done and it sucked bigtime.  I kept wanting to ask for A1 steak sauce all night, but I fought the urge since it seemed inappropriate to slather such a nice piece of meat in sauce.  (However, when I got to my room later and saw the 6 ounces of steak leftovers I had remaining, I silently kicked myself for not grabbing some A1 from the cafe downstairs in the hotel).  \n\nIn addition to the dreadful steak, I had what was possibly the worst accompanying side dish EVER.  I am speaking of the Tuscan Kale - capitalized because of its notoriety.  Ordinarily, I love kale, and I especially love bacon.  I mean, what could go wrong here?  EVERYTHING!  The dish was WAY too salty (I don't care if it over-reduced in the pot or the bacon makes it saltier - shouldn't you know that before you serve it!?!?  Taste, taste, taste your food, chefs) and it was WAY too much.  I mean, I had enough kale leftovers to satisfy my vegetable requirement for a week.  It was a nightmare I tell you, and since I didn't finish it that night and had no fridge, it made for yummy, i mean yucky, smelling leftovers the next morning when i woke up from an alcohol-induced coma.  So wrong in so many ways.\n\nAfter these mishaps it was all i could do to get out of this place, no dessert needed.  I don't care what you other yelpers say, this place will never ever see me again.  Period.  I had a much better steak at Brand in Monte Carlo or even at the Outback in front of Casino Royale.  Seriously.\n\nI too, feel like an idiot for being excited to eat here.  I figured the way Tom is always harping on other chefs about taste, his shit would be on point, excuse my language.  I guess the portions are large and you will definitely have leftovers - likely because it was too nasty to finish the first time - but I would save your money.  If you happen to be in MGM I'd go for L'Atelier definitely over Craftsteak.  Next time I go there, I will be walking past this joint, with not a second glance, and heading straight to SeaBlue or Shibuya."

S"Good, but not great...\n\nSloppiness in the kitchen prevented this from being a better review than it is, but if the kitchen can make mistakes like these, I have serious questions about how good they are.\n\nWe all had salads for our first course:\n - The Caesar was enough for two, but the dressing was boring to say the least.  No brightness of any sort.\n - The baby beets were good, though again the dressing was much understated - that is to say, mostly olive oil.\n - The arugula was fine, but again nothing special.\n - The roasted red peppers were fine, though oily.\n\nAs for mains:\n - The New York strip was cooked perfectly, but was served a little above room temperature.  I would have sent it back, but figured that if I did so, I'd be getting my steak while everyone else was having dessert.\n - The filet we had at the table was excellent.  However, the portion was huge.\n - The flat iron steak was a bit small and not cooked medium well as requested, but the taste was excellent.\n - The grilled salmon was cooked properly and was deemed to be wonderful.\n\nSides:\n - Asparagus - grilled to death and greasy  - uck!\n - Brussels Sprouts - what can you say about food cooked with bacon - yummy - if not a bit greasy.  (We ate all of them.)\n - Potatoes - we ordered Fingerlings but got whipped Yukon Gold.  (We didn't request a change since it was not worth worrying about.)  The whipped potatoes had enough butter and cream in them to clog the arteries of the people at the table next to ours.  Consistency was a bit too much like baby food for us, but they were very good.\n\nDesserts:\n - Ice cream - not much to say about that\n - Monkey bread - very good, but very rich\n - Banana brioche bread pudding - okay - I'm still waiting for the taste of the banana.\n\nFor the price of the meal, the portions were very generous.  All of the sides were big enough for generous helpings for two or three people.  However, the fact that the kitchen sent out a cold steak and grossly overcooked asparagus gives me more than ample cause for concern.\n\nAll of the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.\n\nAll-in-all, a very good value for the money, but the kitchen needs to clean up their act.  I would give them a second chance, but having been to other steak houses in Vegas, it would be a hard sell, since we know of better choices with more professional kitchens and exceptional service."

My wife and I both had the domestic wagyu hanger steak. Cooked medium rare. The service was great and they did not constantly bother you but they also did not ignore you. Besides the Steak the corn side was the standout.

S"I'd like to preface this with the fact that I think Vegas Restaurant Week is great, we get to experience all these awesome restaurants without breaking our bank (as much).\n\nThat said, we went to Craftsteak during restaurant week. When we told them we were there for Restaurant Week (a group of 8) tried to give our order the waiter told us there was no need.  Apparently at Craftsteak, Restaurant Week meals are served family-style, so that everyone can try every dish.  For $50 a person, the dishes were as follows:\n\nFirst Course\n\nAppetizers\n\nShaved Fennel, Lemon, Olive Oil\nVermont Farm Quail, Quince Saba\nItalian Buffalo Mozzarella, Hazelnuts\nPersian Cucumber, Watercress, Ginger\n\n\nSecond Course\n\nEntrees\n\nGrilled Angus Skirt Steak\nPrime Beef Flat Iron\nDiver Sea Scallops, Lemon Vinaigrette\n\nSide Dishes\n\nBrentwood Sweet Corn, Green Onions\nOrganic Baby Shiitake Mushrooms\nYukon Gold Potato Puree, Chives\n\n\nThird Course\n\nDessert\nPastry Chef's Selection of Confections, Ice Cream and Sorbet\n\n\nOne of stars for the night was definitely the quail, which was succulent and sweet and came with some delicious almost candied grapes... I heard the scallops were the most awesome of the three entrees (unfortunately I didn't have any).   \n\nNumber one for me, though were all of the side dishes.  The potato puree, the corn and the mushrooms were all amazing.  Those were finished off even before th entrees were.  \n\nAs far as the desserts go, they were surprisingly good. (I'm generally disappointed with fixe-prixe desserts).  We had a butterscotch cinnamon roll type pastry, 4 flavors of ice cream/sorbet, creme brulee and a molten chocolate cake.  The chocolate cake was on the dry side, but all of the other desserts were delicious.  \n\nAll-in-all I give this restaurant 4 stars, not because it wasn't super awesome, but I feel that if I had the choice there are a few restaurants I would probably choose to go to over craftsteak for the price point."

It had flavor but came out cold as well. Diver scallops, taste good, also cold. Best part of the way over priced dinner was the oysters which are pretty hard to screw up. Service was Ok.

We've hit a them all on the strip, but this is the first time I've been truly disappointed. They were out of a few of the items on the drink menu. The steaks were mediocre at best. In particular the prime NY strop was extremely bad. No flavor at all and there was so much fat and connected tissue that I couldn't even eat 3/4 of it. Upon telling the staff, they were in different. No apology or effort to make it right.  I've had better steaks and service at your middle of the road steak chain on the side of the highway. I would not return and would recommend going elsewhere. On top of everything else they have a photographer walking thru taking pictures of you like you are at an amusement park...quite tacky!  Go"

This past trip, Craftsteak was one that I had been wanting to try for awhile now. \n\nI went here with a party of 5 and we all decided to do the chef's tasting. We ended up doing the wagyu tasting, which I believe was $140 per person. Just FYI, if one person wants to do the tasting, then everyone has to do the tasting, they won't just do it for a few people in your party. It's just because of the way they serve it, family style. But i think the tasting menu is the way to go because you get to try so many things!\n\nFirst off, the service was absolutely amazing. We had two waitresses, but then other waiters/waitresses would come by to check on us as well. Everyone was great and very friendly which is a huge plus for me.\n\nWe decided to go for the wine pairing because it was easier then trying to find some decent bottles of wine that everyone could agree on. It came with three wines, a chardonnay I think from nickel nickel, a cab from Jordan winery, and then some kind of dessert wine. I'm not usually a fan of white wine, but it did pair well with the first course. \n\nFirst course was all appetizers. I honestly can't remember everything they brought out but there were 5 or 6 appetizers in total that came out and they were all delicious. \n\nSecond course was the meat and sides. I know one of the sides was mashed potatoes, the other one was carrots, we had peas with hot sauce, and asparagus. I didn't try the peas because hot sauce of peas just didn't sound appealing to me, but according to the other people in the party, it was good. I always make the mistake of filing up on mashed potatoes because that is my favorite side of all time, and this time was no exception. \n\nThey literally give you 5 or 6 cuts of meat! It is heaven. Here is the mistake we made and you should definitely try to avoid this if you like your meat medium rare/rare: since the meat comes in cask iron skillets, take out all of the pieces of meat and put them on your regular plates. What happened was that we left the steak in the skillets (rookie mistake, I know) and by the time we got to the last few cuts, it was well done. So the first few cuts we had were absolutely amazing, however, as we got to the better cuts (we saved best for last) they were overcooked :( All in all, still a very good meal. \n\nJust when you think you're going to explode, dessert comes out. You seriously want to save room because it is quite the spread. Any dessert you're craving, they will have it. I seriously think they brought out 8 desserts for the 5 of us. They were all spectacular. \n\nThis place is definitely worth the money but just know that it is not going to be a cheap meal, so save your pennies or walk away from that blackjack table while you're ahead!"

S'Like probably everyone else on here, I am a big fan of Top Chef and Tom Colicchio. When deciding on restaurants to eat at in Vegas, Craftsteak was a given. Located in the restaurant corner of the MGM Grand (it was a little hard to find so allot some time to find it when you get there), Craftsteak at first looks like a quaint little coffee shop next to some bigger gaudier dining facilities. Don\'t be fooled though! Once you walk past the bar, it opens up into a fine dining area that you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nI had read some of the reviews here and searched for menus online to figure out what I was prepared to eat (and pay for!). There are 2 things you can do with the menu. You can either order the individual dishes that you want (mostly for those who have been there before and know what they want) or you can go with the chef\'s menu. \n\nUnderstand that when you come here, you are prepared to eat meat. If you\'re vegetarian, you\'ll find dishes, but you won\'t get quite the experience that your fellow carnivores will get. Given that this was my first time here, I went with the Chef\'s menu which is for parties of 2 or more. On the Chef\'s menu, there are several choices and the increasing prices correlates with the grade of beef and whether you want lobster with that. I went with the domestic wagyu surf and turf which I think was $155 per person with a minimum of 2 people.\n\nDon\'t worry if you don\'t like or can\'t eat certain types of foods when ordering the chef\'s menu. Tell the waiter! The chef\'s menu is anything but set and changes with the people who order and the waiter who serves you! My fiance doesn\'t like mushrooms so that was scratched off the menu and replaced by spinach and some potatoes that were mashed to the point that they were just golden liquid yellow goodness.\n\nWe started off with 4 appetizer dishes which included the following: prosciutto with a pear chutney , seared shrimp cocktail, fresh mozzarella, and a fresh caesar salad topped with fresh anchovies. I have to be honest, they were all very nicely prepared, very delicious, but if you\'re here to get "mind blowing" flavors and flavor combinations, this might disappoint you. However, I can\'t stress enough that they use the freshest of ingredients. I don\'t normally like anchovies, but these were delicious!\n\nI had ordered a lobster bisque to taste since so many people recommended it, but I think the waiter forgot about that. Luckily he did because I was about to explode afterwards. TOO MUCH FOOD! LOL\n\nThen we got served the main course: the skirt steak, riblet and lobster. I actually didn\'t think the lobster was all that stunning. It was good, but nothing special! The skirt steak and riblet, on the other hand, were simply delicious. They were so savory and literally melts in your mouth. The sauce is quite stunning and perfectly complements the expensive beef.\n\nBut wait! It\'s not over until after dessert! They gave us 4 desserts: spiced pineapple (eh), 2 types of sorbets (pleasant), chocolate lava cake (mm) and monkey bread with banana ice cream. Now, for me, the most mind blowing dish of the night was the monkey bread! It\'s pretty much like a cinnamon roll but the caramelized sugar and perfect amount of flavoring makes it worth coming to Craftsteak to have this pastry. \n\nI forgot to mention earlier that their bread is fantastic, but don\'t fill up! I think we ate all 6 rolls and that doomed us for the rest of the dinner. \n\nService here is great. They are not only attentive (and not annoyingly so), but they are pleasant to speak to and very polite. However, I did feel that we lost some of that attentiveness towards the end of the night. If it were at some other restaurant, I wouldn\'t be bothered, but since we\'re tipping these people $80-$100 for the food, you would expect better.\n\nDress code is business casual (button up shirts, no jeans, no ties, no jackets). If you\'re here on the weekend, I recommend getting a reservation. If you\'re in a hurry to go to a show, then maybe the Chef\'s menu is not for you. If you order dishes individually, just let the waiter know that you have a show. They will get you out in time!'

S"Best service in Vegas!  This review is LONG overdue.  My husband and I made a trip to LV in October of 2012 and we made advance reservations at several restaurants we wanted to try.  One of these was Crafsteak.  We made the reservation on Open Table, and noted in the comments that my husband has a food allergy.  \n\nWe arrived about 10 minutes early and we were seated immediately by a very warm hostess.  The place has a surprisingly laid back ambiance and the booths are HUGE and very comfortable.  When our waitress came to the table she immediately indicated that she was aware someone at the table had a food allergy and that she would gladly accommodate and make sure the kitchen was aware as well.  I wish I had written this review sooner so that maybe I could remember her name, but she was an excellent waitress.  Extremely attentive and knowledgeable, and incredibly kind.\n\nWe decided to have the Domestic Wagyu Surf & Turf 3-course menu, along with the wine pairings.  With this menu you have no idea what you will get for each course, it is the chef's selection.  The food was AMAZING!  We got the wagyu tartare and a tomato salad for the appetizer course.  The tartare was perfectly salty and delicious! For the main course we got several cuts of steak, a lobster tail, and a variety of side dishes, including the mushroom assortment and french fries.  The lobster was tender and sweet, cooked to perfection.  The steaks melted in your mouth, were super flavorful, and were cooked exactly medium-rare, as we ordered them.  For dessert we got an assortment of house-made sorbets, as well as the cinnamon monkey bread.  The monkey bread was meant only for me as my husband could not eat it, so the sorbets were meant for him (but of course I tried the sorbets as well).  The sorbets were perfectly tart and refreshing.  The monkey bread was very tasty, just a little too sweet for my liking.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so sadly I could only take a couple of bites, but if sweets are your thing, give it a shot.\n\nI cannot rave enough about the quality of the food and the service at Crafsteak!  My husband still dreams about that lobster tail, and he tells anyone on their way to LV that they have to eat there.  \n\nMy only complaint (if I must write one), is that the amount of food that comes with the 3-course menu is just too much for 2 people.  It's impossible to finish it all, and some of the items just wouldn't be good reheated.  We made sure to finish our favorites and had them pack up the items we could reheat, but still left a good amount of food on the table, which felt wasteful.  Keep in mind they are bringing out full portions of every item, including multiple steaks and sides.  I suppose that makes it worth the money, but if it were more like a tasting menu (smaller portions) it would be perfect.\n\nLast comment (I promise!)... save your pennies because it's definitely on the pricey side, but you are absolutely getting what you pay for.  It's worth every cent!"

S"This place is definitely worth the money and the experience.  My boyfriend and I are very picky eaters, and this is my first rating EVER with 5 stars! Beautiful place, fantastic service, definitely hats off to the chef. My boyfriend bought tickets for KA right in MGM near Craftsteak, and they asked us if we'd like to throw in a 3 course meal at Craftsteak for $50/person, which was supposed to be $100/person, damn was it worth it.  The place doesn't even need to use butter or tons of oil for every dish to make it extremely good, like many other places. I mean, who can't cook well if they're throwing a stick of butter in everything? They didn't even need too much sauce or anything, they had the distinct flavors cooked into each and every bite. The chef's got skill- believe me! When we went, we expected to be given just 3 different dishes per person, which we choose out of a few choices for each course. Instead, they just gave us the whole chef's taster! And it wasn't like every dish was the size of my palm like most expensive places - some were small, but some were large, and we had plenty to take home. It was definitely enough to feed 4. \nThese were the dishes we got:\n\nAppetizer:\n\nbread - they make it themselves, and they give you 2 kinds! yummm\nSalad - this was just plain salad with watered down dressing :p the only dish which wasn't superb. But as if you were gonna come here just for salad!\nQuail - soooo delicious. Tasted like really good steak, yet it was quail!\nRoasted Red peppers - Considering it was just red pepper slices, it \nwas surprisingly good.\n\nMain Course:\n\nDiver Scallops - so buttery and fresh you'd never guess you were in a desert.\nFree range Chicken -  Kind of bland. Okay fine the other dish that wasn't superb.\nHangar Steak - thin, salty, peppery crust on the outside, cooked medium rare on the inside. The BEST dish, alongside the quail\n\nSide dishes:\n\nYukon Puree - THE most buttery mashed potatoes you'll ever find! \nThere was actually melted butter floating on top of the whole dish. It was so pureed it was like a heavy cream.\n\nBraised Asparagus - I've never tasted asparagus that I couldn't stop  \neating. It was almost melt-in-my mouth good - cooked for the perfect amount of time, it was neither soggy or hard.\n\nBaby shiitake mushrooms - These were SO delicious. They didn't have that aftertaste shiitake mushrooms have, nor that chewy texture.  I could literally eat a huge platter full of just these lil mushrooms. \n\nDessert:\n\nOMG they gave us 4 ice cream scoops, each a different flavor: \nButter Pecan, Chocolate, Strawberry Sorbet, Kiwi Sorbet. All made from scratch.\n\nFrench Vanilla Cheesecake: THE BEST CHEESECAKE EVER!!!! You HAVE to order this. It was straight melt-in-your-mouth, SO-damn -creamy, SO rich you'd think you wouldn't be able to swallow it, vanilla bean-y and yet, not so sweet like cheap bakeries make it that it hurts your throat. If you don't order this, you're missing out. My mouth's DROOLING from thinking about it! Seriously.\n\nFingerling Donut: rich, buttery, flaky pastry that has its own dipping sauce, which is incredibly tasty. It tasted like a donut, but denser, richer, and more buttery.\n\nFresh Fruit: sliced strawberries and pineapples. Even their fruit was the perfect amount of ripeness and sweetness!\n \nYou've got to eat here. I'm one picky, hard to please lil bitch..and if I thought it was scrumptious, then believe me. It must be MORE than scrumptious."

S'After spending a long weekend working, my co worker and I, who were both staying at the MGM Grand, decided to stay in house for dinner, and try out Craft Steak. \n\nEverything from the ambiance, to the wait staff, to the amazing food was perfect from the moment we walked in. \n\nThe Pork Belly Slaw was a amazing twist for a stater salad. That followed by the perfect medium rare cooked bone in ribeye was a perfect combination, along with the Risotto. The Mushroom & Pancetta Risotto has to be the best tasting side dish I have had in Las Vegas, and I have eaten an numerous places there. \n\nAll in all, I cannot say anything bad about my experience. I would definitely recommend dinning here.'

S"This is one of the best steak restaurants I have ever been to. Everything about this place was superb. The only thing better than eating steak at this restaurant would be to have sex afterwards... that's the perfect evening. \n\nThis place exudes romance, and I'm not talking about the cheesy Vegas style, I'm talking the real thing. The waitstaff was one of the best I've seen in years. You have a team of people waiting on you. We had team 4. The leader of team 4 was Kevin and he was excellent... courteous, funny, helpful, prompt, etc. Olga was the main woman getting our things and she did a very good job. There was only one mistake the whole meal and that was refilling a drink. She brought my friends drink instead of mine, but then Kevin came over and said don't worry about it, keep it, and here's your drink. Mistake corrected. \n\nWe decided to get the Three Course Domestic Wagyu Beef Meal for $130 a person. They were participating in the Three Squared meal event for $50 a person, but we opted to go for the gusto and get a better meal (and deal, at least in this place). They seem to be a big martini place. I'm not really a martini type of person, but, I thought when in Rome... So, I got the Expresso Martini. Sounds unique enough and I needed some caffeine to balance out my continual alcohol intake. Without a doubt, it was one of the best drinks I've had... and then had again. My friend had the Key Lime Martini... and it was excellent as well. \n\nNow the food. The homemade starter rolls were good. They had that little touch by having some sea salt on them. But, don't do more than one. Despite our alcohol blood level, we knew to wait for the meal. We were then presented with our appetizer which consisted of Caesar Salad with Anchovies, Fresh Buffalo Mozzarella, Heirloom Tomatoes, and Shrimp Cocktail. The shrimp were the size of my hand and very good for being so large. The mozzarella was in a 25 year old port sauce... yumm. \n\nThen, came the beef. We requested the ribeye and the filet. I guess I should back up a bit. The Domestic Wagyu Beef Meal is what the chef decides to throw together, but you can make suggestions, and we did... at least for the steaks. The steaks were exquisite. They were perfectly cooked, tender beyond belief, and the flavor... amazing. This course also came with Roasted White Corn... incredible, asparagus... good (for me, the one thing that approached average), and the Yukon Gold Pur\xc3\xa9e Potatoes... worth every bite. \n\nSince the devouring was done, the next course came, dessert. It consisted of: Cinnamon Monkey Bread, Pecan Toffee & Banana Brown Sugar Ice Cream... wow, Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, Blueberries & Lemon Poppy Seed Tuile... it was seductively smooth, and a fresh fruit concoction with a Watermelon and a Rasberry Sorbet to end it all. \n\nThis is definitely a stop to make when in Vegas and in the MGM Grand."

S'We were in Las Vegas for mine and my best friends 21st birthdays with our moms. We knew we wanted to go out for one very nice dinner while we were in Vegas. So I did some research and then decided on Craftsteak based on many reviews I had read. Our group of four decided to do the Chefs Seasonal Tasting Menu.\n\nFirst Course:\nDiver Sea Scallops with Shaved Fennel (5 stars)\nRoasted Heirloom Beet Salad and  Pickled Egg (4 stars)\nItalian Buffalo Mozzarella (4.5/5 stars)\nMain Course:\nRoasted Prime Filet Mignon (4.5/5 stars)\nGrilled Prime Angus Flat Iron (5 stars)\nSides:\nBraised Brussels Sprouts with Smoked Bacon (3.5/4 stars)\nMushroom Assortment (5 stars)\nRicotta Ravioli (5 stars)\nDesserts:\nVanilla Bean Cheesecake (4.5 stars)\nChocolate Souffle (5 stars)\nWarm Apple Fritters (5 stars)\nCinnamon Monkey Bread (4.5/5 stars)\nChocolate Ganache Cake (5 stars)\n\nI could not have asked for a better meal, it was absolutely divine. There was very minimal talking during the meal, you could have heard a pin drop on our table. We were all floored with the flavor of every element of our meal. \n\nThe wait staff was extremely kind and helpful whenever we had questions. They never rushed our meal along in between courses but had perfect timing and never had us waiting for the next course. \n\nCraftsteak is pricey but please believe it is totally worth it!'

S"Not your average steakhouse - if ur a fan of Waygu beef - definitely come here.  Good overall. Went for a group business dinner - restaurant is gorgeous!  Beet salad was tasty - tried the braised short ribs and skirt steak both fabulous.  Mushroom medly and jerusalem artichoke sides were my faves -  Ate at Craft Dallas earlier this month and thought their sides were better - nothing with Truffles on this menu which was a mini dissapoint...  The bread pudding and chocolate lava cake is worth the visit alone.  Service was top notch.  would definitely come back the next time i'm in Vegas...."

S"so went here for a friends wedding dinner. Wow. It was a beautiful place, great service...I hate to say it, but the food was almost anticlimatic. We were served the flat-iron steak, the rib-eye steak, and the skirt steak, and unlike our friend Black Angus, it was cooked medium, and you could taste the different flavors. Yum. The sides were pretty good, although I guess after hearing so much about this place (didn't know it was the Top Chef guy's restaurant), I don't know what I expected, except I expected more? The spinach was good, the shitake mushrooms...those were good...the potatoes were fine. It was all fine, but like I said, maybe somewhat anticlimatic."

S"I came to this thinking its just another fancy steak restaurant....(yes very expensive) but man I put this place hands down the best steak restaurant I been too. I travel a lot and every where I go always end up eating at least 1 steak restaurant. I order a Kobe wagyu (note to everyone) Kobe steak does exist but it comes from certain type or cows. It was $270 and that's someones week paycheck but it was worth it (order medium or medium rare). I would describe it as eat foie gras of steak... very rich flavored. I also had a piece of the local filet and when you do order this have them slice it for you. I have eaten here 3-4 times and I will always come back when I crave steak. Getting it comped is a plus for me."

S"This is your typical steak house, plus some. The atmosphere was cool, with subdued lighting and leather seating. The tables are large, almost too large, but allowed for plenty of room when the food started coming out! They have a classic cocktail menu, and don't skimp on the alcohol. I had a Moscow mule to start, and my husband had a smokey martini, with scotch and vodka. \n\nI started with the lobster bisque. It was amazing! There was so much lobster meat in that soup and it was so rich, a great way to start the meal. My husband started with the seasonal oysters. Can't go wrong with oysters! For entrees I had the dry aged strip steak and my husband had the bison steak. The steaks were cooked perfectly. We also had the roasted heirloom cauliflower and farro for side dishes. We really did not need 2 side dishes. There was so much food! Not only was the food great, but the portion sizes were much larger than either of us expected. We did leave room for dessert, and split a couple of scoops of ice cream. \n\nOverall this was a great meal, but a definite splurge. We each had a cocktail, and 1 glass of wine each and our total bill was around $240, including tip."

S'There\'s not much I can say about Craftsteak that hasn\'t already been said.  It is BY FAR the best restaurant I\'ve eaten at.  \n\nI do have recommendations though.  I did some pretty deep research on the perfect steakhouse before we left for Vegas.  I ended on Craftsteak, and after all the rave reviews, I wanted to do the American Wagyu tasting menu.  My husband was not too thrilled about some of the selections we were going to get, and we almost ordered off the menu ourselves.  But at the last minute, I said NO, we have to do it.  So we got the tasting menu.  \n\nFirst, I would have needed a cow\'s four stomachs to eat all the food they brought us. I ate some stuff I normally would not eat. And I\'m so glad I did! I\'ll go through the highlights (and what I\'ll order next time so I don\'t waste all the beautiful delicious food I can\'t eat)\n\nKobe steak tartare - I have never eaten raw beef before. I never wanted to eat raw beef. It tastes so good cooked, why eat it raw?  Well I stand corrected. Maybe the best weird thing I\'ve ever had. I ate over half the plate of meat.  I felt my inner tigress coming out and I apologized to my husband in advance in case I bit him later. \n\nMushroom Sampler - Eat all the "Hen of the Woods" (maitake) variety.  Normally I cannot stand mushrooms, but the waiter said they were good so I figured hey, I just ate raw beef, what\'s a little fungus?  The mushroom tasted like rich beef and red wine. Very complex, smokey flavor.  I will seek them out around here, because they were SO good.\n\nAmerican Wagyu skirt steak - skip the more expensive rib eye.  Go for the skirt. It was so good we barely touched the rib eye.  Literally melted in your mouth. Worth the $130 a pop alone.\n\nThey also brought us four deserts, but just looking at them I felt my stomach perforating and spilling into my body cavity.  Gross visual, but that\'s how full I was.\n\nOn a side note, we both noticed the food gave us MAD GAS!  Not that I cared, but jusy FYI... I guess raw meat has its drawbacks.'

S"So being a fan of Top Chef this place needed to be visited. It is owned by Tom Coliccio the head judge for Top Chef. So let's say high expectations were already in place. The first thing that came out were the dinner rolls, they were small but topped with some butter and freshly grind-ed sea slat. It was agreed that if this was any indication of how the rest of meal would be then it was the best choice. \nI ordered some oysters, now being from East Coast I am picky and they were OK. A little on the small side but flavorful and good quality shell fish. Then my T-Bone came out. It was cut away from the bone to ensure the proper way I wanted cooked, medium of course. Then the fillet side was so tender I could have cut with a butter knife. The sides we ordered were the carrots and roasted potatoes. The waiter recommended that we split a side and they were large enough to accommodate us. \nAll and all one of the best steaks I have enjoyed thus far. Cooked perfectly, great service, not too obnoxious and good atmosphere."

They didn't skimp on the wine either, 3 full glasses.  thogh...I think I would have preferred just buying a single bottle that I liked.  The wines were OK.  Would have given this place 5 stars easily, however we had reservations at 9... didn't get seated till 9:45.  The hostess said that if we had drinks at the bar, they would be on the house.

S'Most unpleasant dinner I\'ve ever had! Before ordering I told my waiter that I am allergic to nuts and fruits. He assured me that he had it written down and he will notify ALL chefs! With that in mind my boyfriend and I ordered the Domestic Wagyu chef\'s selection. Comes as a 3 course meal. The first two courses were not too bad, everything went downhill when dessert hit the table. EVERY SINGLE DESSERT HAD NUTS AND FRUITS! seriously?! I told my waiter that I am HIGHLY allergic. They apologized and told me they will make me something else. 45 MINUTES LATER they come back saying i\'m sorry our chef\'s cannot accommodate you! Seriously? it takes 45 minutes? Not only that, he comes back and tells me he will give me a lousy scoop of ice cream instead. He said "You Paid for it" might as well eat something. Unacceptable, my dinner was $400! If I would have known I wouldn\'t have chosen the stupid Chef\'s Selection! Not only that they did not have the courtesy to have the Manager come out to tell me anything they can do to help me.

S"Craftsteak, though still good, is not the same restaurant that got me to write a 5-star review in June.\n\nMy main gripe is that for the same price, you are now getting much less food. I was there this past weekend and again a group of eight of us had the Wagyu tasting menu. Gone is the Kobe tartare, replaced with a salad of just lettuce. Gone also is at least 2 cuts of steak while the remaining cuts seem smaller than before. The shitake mushrooms were very dry this time. Our table was also not covered with endless deserts like last time. Rest assured that you will not go hungry but it's no longer the extravagance it once was. And for the same ~$200 per person bill, you definitely have better choices now.\n\nIf I go back, if, I would opt for something a la carte next time."

S"We went to Craftsteak for my birthday, and it did not disappoint. As many yelpers note, the rolls are buttery and hot.  They are serious, try not to fill up on them, but I think you will.  It's okay, happens to the best of us.  They are big league carbs.\n\nMy wife ordered the heirloom tomatoes appetizer, and we had an unfortunate incident.  The server spilled them down my wife's back, and she was wearing a white shirt, so it was beyond noticeable.  But, the manager couldn't have been more friendly about it.  She quickly offered to pay for the dry cleaning and of course replaced the dish, gratis.  So, although that was annoying, accidents happen and they handled it excellently.\n\nThe prosciutto appetizer was a table favorite, as were the shrimp.  My steak was fantastic, a big fat ribeye (if you read any of my other reviews, you will notice a pattern in my choice of steak).  Textbook medium rare  The wine list is very solid, but it's expensive.  But, if you are eating at Craftsteak, you probably weren't looking for value menu pricing.\n\nDefinitely good for a special occasion."

Portions were served family style and a lot of it, veg was awesome and who knew so many types of beets existed.\n\nMeat was well prepared and they signature spare rib was fall apart wonderful.

S'Escorted by a beautiful hostess to my seat in a decidedly "steakhouse" atmosphere. Nothing too striking or amazing about the decor. \n\nStarted with bread served in a cast iron skillet. Very good bread resembling a Hawaiian roll. \n\nI was hoping for a chef\'s selection or menu but they only have that for two or more (curses to traveling alone).\n\nMy waiter recommended the scallops for an appetizer. For my first bite I experienced amazingly buttery scallops with a seasoned buttery flavor. However, when I finished my first scallop (of three) I found myself shifting from amazement to indifference to slight disapproval of the (basil?) herb and lemon undertone. The more I ate the more flavors I c\n\nTo me, I felt that the scallops on their own were so amazing, a simple butter sauce would be perfect with a tiny squeeze of lemon. But that\'s just me...\n\nI ordered the domestic Wagyu ribeye. It was a pretty bad steak. I read all the reviews of how amazing this place was so I came ready for a delicious experience and was quite disappointed. Uninspired was the word that came to mind. \n\nThe beef had a dual personality. One side was rough and chewy. Chewy. It was a perfectly cooked medium but one side had a somewhat decent texture but the other end was downright ... Chewy. I didn\'t even finish my steak it was that bad. And this wasn\'t bad "for Wagyu". It was bad for steak. I\'ve had way better steaks at Outback for fractions of the $105 price tag. \n\nFor sides, I ordered spinach but was brought half corn and half spinach. Thanks GOODNESS for the corn!! The spinach was plain and boring. But once I had a bite of corn it almost made up for everything else. It was unbelievable!!!!! It reminded me of a gourmet BBQ. An assortment of flavors that WOWed me. \n\nI spoke up and the manager brought me a domestic Wagyu filet mignon. I\'m writing to here so I haven\'t gotten it yet. \n\nThe manager said he understood my taste on the steak is mine and valid. I appreciate how he tactfully said "these are amazingly expensive steaks so I don\'t know WTF your taste buds are telling you". Kudos to the politically savvy manager. \n\nI can only really compare my experience to mine at Sage a few months ago. It was a completely different experience from start to finish. I felt like I was in a luxury restaurant. I think 50 people came by my table every 45 seconds. Here, I felt almost like I was on an island. \n\nI guess I feel the same way about the MGM Grand Hotel that I do about craftsteak. It is nice but there are better, fancier, deliciouser places costing less. \n\nI\'m still waiting for my replacement steak. I really would rather just pay the full check, leave, and chalk it up to a bad experience I probably wouldn\'t repeat (even if this was an off night and I got that one bad steak). \n\nAs I sit here thinking, I think back to discussions I\'ve had about what differentiates a professional from an amateur (other than money). A professional is consistent. Sure, amateurs may make a great play, take an amazing photo, or cook a great meal but it takes a professional to do it to a level of quality day in and day out. A bad day for a professional is still usually better than most amateurs. So even if this steak was an anomaly, a place of this caliber should not have too many nights that are this bad. \n\nWith all that said and done, I will give this place a 3 instead of a 2 because I\'m hoping they are usually much better and one poor review shouldn\'t dissuade anyone from trying them out. Now, if they have a bad experience then they can rate them a 2...\n\n\nOK I just finished my replacement filet. A finish able steak. Still don\'t feel it was worth the money but at least this was a good steak.\n\nWhen I got the bill, I was disappointed that the manager did not discount anything. Not that I expected it, but traditionally management would comp an appetizer or offer free dessert or something.'

S"This was an amazing meal.\n\nI had a reservation for 9:30PM and waited at the bar until my table was ready, that took about 10 minutes.  The bar was really busy, martinis left and right.  I started with a Sapphire and Tonic, probably my most favorite drink.  It was mixed well and they actually had plump limes as the lime juice really brings all the flavors together into one cohesive taste for your palate.\n\nDuring dinner I had a classic gin martini, Tanqueray No. 10 was used.  The Tanqueray No. 10 has a more full rolling flavor rather than the regular Tanqueray that, I feel hits with a hard sharp punch.  The martini was mixed well.  The girlfriend had their apple martini, it was also mixed well, tasted like candy, couldn't even tell there was rum in it.\n\nFood, me and my lady got the american wagyu tasting menu and had the server surprise us for the menu.  She did an awesome job.\n\nThis tasting menu comes with two appetizers per person, one steak per person, two sides per person, and two desserts per person.\n\nAppetizers:  \nArugula salad with sliced radishes with a thai lime vinaigrette.  Peppery with the mild earthiness of the radish and wrapping it together with the sourness from the lime in the vinaigrette.\n\nSpinach salad with sliced red onions, sliced cucumbers, with a bleu cheese vinaigrette.\n\nBuffalo mozzarella drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, topped with diced tomatoes, roasted macadamia nuts and garnished with some toasted fennel.\n\nGrilled Hawaiian prawns.  This was really good, lemon and cocktail sauce on the side.  Don't forget to suck those heads.\n\nMains:\nDomestic wagyu 10oz filet mignon and domestic wagyu 12oz skirt steak.  Cooked slightly under medium-rare.  Both cuts had very good marbling, flavored perfectly and cooked how I like it.  Very very tasty!\n\nSides:\nYukon gold puree, mushroom assortmet (four types), sauteed baby broccoli.  All were really good.  The potato puree would be the highlight for the sides as they were rich and creamy and a nice surprising twist to the normal mashed potatoes.  \n\nDesserts:\nRoasted pineapple\nIt was good, but didn't really do anything for me\n\nSorbets, Orange basil, the orange and basil really mixed well, unfortunately being so full, the basil was a little more pungent than I would have liked.  Second sorbet, Cabernet Concord grape, this was great the grape flavor was not too tangy and mixed well with the Cabernet.\n\nChocolate ganash cake with sweet cream.  I really liked this, dark chocolate, not too sweet, the addition of the sweet cream on the side made it perfect.  Nice warm oozing chocolate center mixed with cake and topped with sweet cream.\n\nPear cranberry crumble topped with a scoop of ginger iced cream.  Good texture in the crumble and flavor mixed with the sweetness of the pear followed by a very slight tang from the cranberry.  The ginger iced cream hits you with a medium sharp ginger flavor then mellows out as it melds with the flavor of the pear.  Works great.\n\nThis was a very tasty meal.  There was enough food to feed another person.  They even packed it up for us to go.  Not only did they pack up the food, they gave us another glass to take or unfinished martinis.\n\nGreat service, great food."

S'WHO: Me and my boyfriend\nWHY: Our 4th year anniversary\n\nThis visit makes it our 3rd visit at Craftsteak and all I can say is I\'ve been consistently pleased with the food items I\'ve ordered and the service I\'ve had. \n\nMe and the bf were seated in a comfy booth, which I requested when I previously made our reservation online on MGM\'s website.  Our server introduced himself and also wished us a happy anniversary.  **On a sidenote, I mentioned this detail in my online reservation and so I\'m pretty sure he was aware of that detail since we didn\'t specifically tell him of our occasion.**  We placed our drink orders: my bf ordered a Martini and I ordered a Champagne Martini.  A lady carrying a large professional camera then came up to us and asked if we wanted our picture taken.  We said sure and for the next minute or so, I felt like we were at a photo studio with the poses she suggested we do and the bright flash going off every other second.  She told us she\'d bring the photos back later for us to look at and with that she left.  Our drinks came out along with the cute mini bread loaf and butter. By this time we already knew what to order: \n\n-No appetizer since 2 side dishes and our entrees would be more than enough for the both of us\n-2 Side Dishes: the Roasted Garlic and Leek Gratin & the Roasted Corn \n-Entrees: the 8oz Wagyu Beef (medium) for me & the 10oz Wagyu Beef (medium well) for the bf\n\nBy the time our order was brought out, we had also ordered a 2nd round of drinks.  The past 2 times we\'ve eaten here, we\'ve always ordered the Leek Gratin because of its creamy garlicky deliciousness.  We had never eaten leeks until Craftsteak, but the boatload of butter, cream and roasted garlic added to the dish and you might not realize you are eating leeks cuz its that damn good.   The past 2 times we\'ve been to Craftsteak we\'ve ordered the spinach which is good, but not great and so we settled on the Roasted Corn...it easily became our 2nd side dish for future visits. Our steaks were cooked to perfection, tasted lovely, as usual, and easily devoured. I was also completely surprised at how my champagne martini paired well with my meal.  The champagne\'s bubbliness cut through the heaviness of the rich gratin and meaty steak. At the end of our dinner, our server asked if we wanted any dessert.  When we said no, he kept jokingly asking us if we were really sure.  We told him we were happily stuffed and couldn\'t fit anything else in our bellies.  He left and a few minutes later he presented us with a small plate of bite-sized sweets and the words "Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate on the plate.  OMG, super cute and super sweet!\n\nNo sooner had he left, when the lady who took our photos presented us with different photos and an option to purchase a (cheesy) pleather album containing our choice of any 2 photos.  Since the photos did come out cute, I picked the 2 photos while the bf handled the cost.  The grand total for this pleather album with 2 photos?????  $85. Yes, $85 for 2 pictures in a cheesy black pleather album.  However, given that we were in Vegas, on our anniversary, and presented with great looking photos of the both of us together we couldn\'t say no.  As a \'freebie\' the lady threw in 2 wallet sized pictures also in a cheesy pleather wallet carrier.  \n\nLong review short: I love the service. I love the drinks. I love the food.\nAnd apparently...I love their $85 photos!'

S"Thanks for this restaurant, Tom Colicchio.\nI went with a large group of friends. There were 8 of us total. We made a reservation days in advance with no issues.\nAfter looking over the menu, everyone decided on getting the chef's beef selection of grade 7 wagyu beef. Seeing how it is the chef's selection, we had no idea what we were getting besides all the cuts of wagyu steak they had available. First came the rolls and butter. These rolls were already delicious. We all devoured them pretty fast and asked for more. \n\nAppetizers\nPersian Cucumber, watercress and ginger salad - nice and refreshing\nWhole grilled shrimp\nProsciutto with plum relish\nWagyu Beef Tartare with crostini - amazing. I've had it at a few other places, but this was way better than others I've tasted.\n\nMain courses with side dishes\nAll cuts of grade 7 wagyu. Everything was so delicious. I would say the best steaks I've ever had so far. Steak temperatures on point. Perfectly medium rare. Seasonings just right. Dip the steak back into the skillets and get even bolder flavors. Take it up another notch, grab the dinner rolls and sop up the meat juices too! Forget bread and butter. Bread and meat sauce is better.\nSide dishes included, asparagus, mushrooms, and yukon gold puree. Sides complemented perfectly and enhanced the experience with the different textures and flavors.\n\nDesserts were last\nCinnamon Monkey Bread, assortment of sorbets/ice cream, dark chocolate tarts, bread pudding, and fresh fruit ended the meal very nicely. My favorite dessert being the monkey bread.\n\nService was great. Waitress was very friendly and gracious. She even joked with us that she might even see us at the clubs afterwards.\nEveryone left very satisfied."

S'I\'m not even sure what I can say about Craftsteak that hasn\'t been said. This place has AWESOME food. It\'s totally worth every penny, like everyone says. My husband and I had the fall/winter tasting menu ($70/pp) which you have to now ask for (it was that popular that they don\'t talk about it on their menus anymore, so be sure and ask!) and you literally get to try everything they mention on the menu. I\'ve never been anywhere that did that before, usually you have to choose your "app, entree & dessert" out of a few choices. It was great to be able to try it all! The wait service was one of the best I\'ve had at any restaurant in my life. They kept bringing out more and more food, I couldn\'t believe it! Definitely a place where you get the most bang for your buck. We had 4 salads (a fennel salad, mozzarella salad, quail and cranberry salad, and a cucumber salad), 3 entrees (two kinds of steak, both cooked perfectly, and giant scallops, also cooked perfectly), 3 sides (the great potato puree everyone talks about, some awesome braised brussel sprouts, and braised mushroom medley), and two desserts (lava cake and monkey bread). I\'ve never eaten so much in my life, but it was so worth it. Also, the hostess heard me mention (totally off-hand, she asked why we were in Vegas) that it was our anniversary, and they gave us the lava cake as an extra dessert for our anniversary (complete with "happy anniversary" piped on the plate in chocolate, yum!) What awesome service! I highly recommend Craftsteak for the service, the ambiance (nice low-lit booths, very romantic), and OF COURSE the food. Eat here if you can! :) Definitely in my top 5 best meals of all time.'

Here we got our pick of soup, salad, 3 appetizers and 3 courses.  Had an authentic caesar salad with anchovies which was really good.  For appetizers what stood out to me was the raw proscuitto and red peppers in olive oil.  So fresh, so flavorful, so satisfying, and not greasy.  We had two kinds of steak and scallops for the main course and also got 3 sides.  Overall a very satisfying meal and we had leftovers!'

S'"I was 32 when I started cooking; up until then, I just ate." - Julia Child\n\n"Great food is like great sex.  The more you have the more you want." - Gael Greene \n\nDo you remember the last moment in your life that brought you great joy? That awesome Christmas present? The raise at work? The new car?\n\nNow think about it, what was the last MEAL that brought you great joy?\n\nMine was Craftsteak.\n\nI had the pleasure of dining with three of my closest friends, whom I introduced the thought of Craftsteak to. I had only heard and read about their signature plate, the Japanese Grill Kobe Wagyu Skirt Steak. Today was the day I found out truly what was in store for me. \n\nAs we toured the menu, it was thought that we were going to order A\'la Carte. But in my mind I knew better than that and decided to simply ask, "What do you recommend we do?" They suggested that the four of us partake in the Grade 7 Surf and Turf. It was to be a feast that we would not regret. \n\nIt would take forever to describe each dish, but to have an idea of what to expect:\n\nFirst Course: Parker House Rolls with Flaked Sea Salt and salted butter; Persian Cucumber, Watercress, and Ginger salad; Heirloom Tomatoes with Olive Oil and Basil; Wagyu Beef Tartare with Crostini; Pacific Blue Prawns (a la plancha).\n\nFavorite Starter - Wagyu Beef Tartare. The wagyu beef tartare was phenomenal. The seasoning had the right amount of saltiness, and the beef\'s texture was not fatty or mushy, but soft and delicate. Paired with the crunchiness of the hot crostinis, I would go back just to order this alone. Truly fabulous.\n\nMain Course: "Black label" Grade 7 Wagyu Beef Filet Mignon, Ribeye, and Skirt Steak; Lobster in saffron butter, grilled asparagus with lemon and thyme, roasted fingerling potatoes with rosemary, assorted mushrooms (hen of the woods, organic baby shiitake, white shimeji, and golden chanterelle).\n\nFavorite Entree - Wagyu Skirt Steak. Perfectly cooked, well seasoned and it absolutely explodes flavor into your mouth. Was the ribeye good? Yes, and so was the filet. But those two steaks paled in comparison that the skirt offers. You are doing yourself a disservice if you come here and you don\'t eat this. \n\nFavorite side - Mushrooms - They complimented the steaks beautifully and the assortment was superb. They were not soggy or overcooked and were a perfect side to the steaks. I do hope on trying the Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes next time I am there.\n\nDessert: Sorbet sampler (concord grape, apple cider, melon, and asian pear); Cinnamon monkey bread with pecan toffee and cajeta ice cream; vanilla bean cheesecake with blueberry compote and semolina tuile; chocolate ganache cake with cocoa nib brittle and sweet cream; warm apple fritters with spiced sugar and apple cider caramel; fresh fruit platter (rocky sweet melon, brown turkey figs, and cho juro asian pears).\n\nFavorite Dessert - Monkey Bread - The monkey bread was not a dessert that exuded elegance or fine dining in the traditional term. But it was delicious and so comforting, especially after such a robust meal, that for me, it brought back those feelings you have as a kid. Flaky, sweet, with the right amount of cinnamon and sugar. The pecan toffee just knocked it out of the park. \n\nI could sit here all day and talk about how delicious the meal was. But it was more than that. Eating at Craftsteak was an absolute privilege and I am so happy that I had the opportunity to eat there, and I\'m very much looking forward to it again the next time I\'m in Las Vegas.\n\nTLDR: Wagyu Beef Tartare was exemplary. Wagyu Skirt Steak blew away the Ribeye and Filet Mignon. Monkey Bread is out of this world. Superb service. Simply put, the Grade 7 Wagyu Surf and Turf was worth every penny and you are doing yourself a disservice by not coming here. EAT THERE NOW.'

S'Who comes to CraftSteak and doesn\'t get the Wagyu tasting menu??\n\nIf you\'re going to splurge, this is the place to do it. I always go for the Surf & Turf Wagyu Tasting and I\'m never disappointed. Alright, I\'ll say that the Ceasar Salad isn\'t a highlight but again, you\'re going to a restaurant with the word \'Steak\' in the name so that definitely sets expectations.\n\nThe lobster is divine totally bathed in butter - I can feel myself getting fatter is write this... and I love it. The skirt is my favorite - so rich and buttery, it literally melts in your mouth. Everything is served family style so your best bet is to come with a group so you can sample everything. The sides are delish - mixed mushrooms, yukon gold puree, white corn - beateous. And to end everything, dessert ranges from assorted sorbets to mixed berry cobbler to my personal favorite... monkeybread!\n\nThe service is literally impeccable. They\'re kind, courteous and engaging not to mention they\'re at your table all the time to see if you need anything. This last time, I came for my anniversary and not only did the waiter comp us a bottle of Muscato but also ANOTHER dessert that had, "Happy Anniversary" with our names written in chocolate. He was also kind enough to make reservations at L\'atelier Joel Robuchon for us for the next night.\n\nWe dropped easily $400 for the 2 of us that night but if there were any restaurant worth doing it at, CraftSteak would be it (well, aside from French Laundry, of course :)'

S"HORRIBLE customer service. Scheduled an anniversary dinner here, and was flummoxed when I tried to let them know we'd be running a bit late (15 minutes), as it was an unusual rain storm that had snarled traffic. First, the woman who answered the phone couldn't seem to find the reservation. Second, the fifteen minute grace period was obviously not okay with her. I was told the only other available time was three hours later. When I told her that we could either be there, but fifteen minutes late, or not come at all, she opted to accept that we wouldn't be coming and spending money there. What??! I mean, not everyone can have TOP CHEF money, but still. Craftsteak is not in need of building a client base? Give me a break. Clearly, the customer service of Tom Colicchio's staff is non-existant. Instead, hubris and bitchiness prevail -- almost like TOP CHEF itself."

S'I was excited to try this place,  but unfortunately, it fell short for me. To start, the restaurant itself is nice, but unfortunately we were there on a Friday night and got seated in the back at a large round table that made me feel like I was at a conference room having an expensive meal.  The food was presented well, but was just ok. The cocktails were not great...lacked flavor (other than the taste of hard liquor) and looked boring.  The only positive at this place was the staff.'

S"Mind blown. Craftsteak is the Charlie Trotters of meat in my book.\n\nSix of us ate here our last night in Vegas as we wanted to have an awesome meal. It's definitely a guys kind of place, but still appealing to carnivorous females. We had one of the chef's tasting menus and tried some incredible things. From the array of salads, to the sides (best corn and mashed potatoes I've ever had), and the meat (incredible skirt steak) to the desserts and cappuccino, this meal was nothing short of a five star experience for me. Everything was timed well and cooked the way we asked The servers were also knowledgeable and helpful as was the sommelier.\n\nSo happy we went here and would definitely recommend to anyone going to Vegas,"

S"I'm not a big eater of steak, so when I eat steak, it better be good. Craftsteak had the holy trifecta of steakhouse goodness--a wide selection of choices w.r.t steak (i.e. every cut, size, and cooking style you could want), delicious sides, and a hearty wine list. As I ate my braised short ribs (cooked for many hours in a low simmer of fatty goodness), sipped my malbec, and partook of the fingerling potatoes / baby spinach / kale / chanterelle mushrooms in the center of our table, I found myself drifting into a blissful state. The decorations are reminiscent of Chicago steakhouses--heavy on the dark colors, leather materials, and ruddy wooden tables and chairs. I felt encased in a womb of beefy goodness. If you're ever on the Strip, I recommend coming here for a strip...steak."

Meal, service, and ambiance did not disappoint. Portions were more than adequate and everything cooked to perfection with attentive but not overbearing service. Just wish we'd had time to really take it all in...def recommend for a quiet, classy meal."

S"I'm a huge fan of Top Chef, so I was very excited to try head judge Tom Collichio's restaurant!  We were seated at a nice booth with a view of the restaurant.  Our server was very attentive and helpful in explaining the menu and offering suggestions.  \n\nWe started with the lobster bisque ($18) and the warm frisee salad ($16) with bacon and champagne vinaigrette.  The lobster bisque had large chunks of fresh lobster and had a nice creamy finish.  The best part of the frisee salad were the chunks of smoked bacon, but it was really heavy as the bacon was quite fatty and the vinaigrette very oily and collected at the bottom of the bowl.  \n\nWe ordered the 22 oz roasted T-bone steak ($56), 18 oz grilled angus bone-in ribeye and diver scallops ($39) for our entrees.  The scallops were quite tender and had a bit of crust on the top, but overall were a little undercooked.  The T-bone steak and ribeye were cooked perfectly, but lacked a bit in flavor and tenderness.  The sides were the best part of the actual entree experience.  We really enjoyed the mushroom medley, broccoli saut\xc3\xa9ed in olive oil and garlic, yukon gold potato puree and potatoes au gratin. \n\nThe cinnamon monkey bread with brown sugar sour cream ice cream ($15) was sweet, buttery and utterly delicious.  The vanilla bean cheesecake ($13) was just okay, nothing special.   \n\nOverall, if you are looking for a steakhouse restaurant, I would pick STK over Craftsteak.  The shrimp rice krispies bisque with tiger prawns at STK was superior in flavor and creaminess to the lobster bisque at Craftsteak.  The bone in filet mignon at STK was more tender and flavorful compared to the T-bone steak and bone in ribeye at Craftsteak.  Craftsteak has many higher end options for types of steak (Wagyu, Kobe, etc), but you pay the price for them.  Even though the music gets really loud at STK, I would rather eat there for the money than Craftsteak any day."

S"I hit this place back at the end of March and holy shmoly, were we spoiled!  I jokingly bitched to my cousin Andrew what a shortcoming of theirs that sometimes I had to exert myself by pouring my wine (The wait staff were persistently adding wine to our glasses and perhaps, two or three times (sigh), I had to do it myself.)  Not to mention that the wait staff would immediately fold up any napkins off-handedly left at the table when someone would go to the bathroom.  Of course, I jokingly complained to Andrew how they would only fold the napkins on the outside of our booth (where they could easily reach them) and not fold the napkins left on the inside our booth, where they couldn't see them.  ha ha, how fastidious I can be.  \n\nOh yeah, and the food was super-fabulous.  Our party of four got the tasting menu with the wine pairing.  We savored our food and wine so much that it became an epic, 3-hour affair.  Not once did the staff make any comments or innuendos that the table was needed for another party or that we should get going or anything like that.  Then they happily obliged and wrapped up our leftovers, so we could enjoy our great meal twice, later, as it happened, after a night of drinking."

S'I know, I know. I ate some cow, but I liked it. \nMy husband and I were in Vegas and my good friend was introducing us to her boyfriend for the first time. I was so exited and told her to choose a spot. Oh. My. Gosh. She chose quite well. So glad I packed my fancy clothes, ya know what I mean? Huh? Huh? Yeah. *Wink*\n\nAs a group of four, we split the Italian Buffalo Mozzarella, Baby Spinach, Brussels Sprouts and Maui Onions. I decided that if I was going to try Hand-Cut Wagyu Beef Tartare, it was going to be at Craftsteak. The table was silent and I felt like Alice drinking from the bottle. It was...different. Almost like, err, cold taut pasta. \n\nThe warm bread is worth it. Trust me. And now for the steak. I\'m not much of a meat eater, but once again, "When in Rome".... I went for the Prime Filet Mignon. I took a bite and closed my eyes.\n\nMy mini vision quest...\n\nMe (In my purple Bestey Johnson number, heels and all, floating in the sky): Why, hello, cow. You\'re in heaven, I see. \n\nCow (flying in the sky, complete with golden halo and wings): So (rubbing its hooves together): What do you think? Juicy enough. Not to gamey?\n\nMe: Oh, Cow. (Hugging cow). You were wonderful. Thank you for providing me with protein from your body and unwillingly sacrificing your life for this meal. Bless you.\n\nCow: (Blushing) Why, thank you!  See you in hell, traitor! (Drop kicks me back to Earth)\n\n***POOF!!!!!***\n\nWhoa. Yeah, it was guilty good. So good, my husband ate the leftovers before I got to them. Sigh. It was a fantastic meal. For the record, they do have vegetarian options, but the vegetarian tasting menu has a two person minimum. Pricey, but the memories are priceless.'

S'I was driving down Las Vegas Blvd and was thinking to myself "craftsteak or Outback, Craftsteak or Outback" and i couldnt decide, so i flipped a coin, heads for Craftsteak and tails for Outback. Landed on Heads!\n\nWasnt able to find menu prices on line, so here\'s the rundown. Steaks range from about 36 bucks (10 oz hanger) to 56 for a 10 oz filet mignon. You can also purchase steaks for hundreds of dollars that are imported from Japan (or something like that) but i stuck with the \'cheaper\' steak, which didnt let me down.\n\nThe Check for 2 people came to 168 (before tip)  and this included: 2 steaks, one cocktail, one diet coke, mashed potato side, frisee (?) salad and a side order of mushrooms (the most expensive one which was 24 bucks, it was a samping). There was no room for dessert at the end, certainly enough food.\n\nThey serve this INCREDIBLE bread before the meal, its so good you dont really even need butter.....so, if you order a bunch of food, beware that this very tempting bread is going to come out, you might want to keep this in mind before ordering a ton of food you might not be able to finish. If i had known this bread was coming out, i might have skipped either the mushrooms or the potatoes.\n\nThe service was pretty good and everyone was very friendly and a manager (i think) came by the table at the end and asked if we enjoyed our meal and he really thanked us for coming by and dining with them.\n\nLooking forward to going back!'

S"Just came from having dinner here, and I've got to say, for $110 meal that included only 1 beer and no dessert, I was not impressed.\n\nAfter reading some of the other reviews, I chose the surf and turf with scallops as the turf option.  IMHO, the scallops were overdone and rubbery.  The steak was a nice texture and done correctly, but didn't even have the fundamentals of seasoning even vaguely noticeable.  It was utterly tasteless.\n\nSo, my apologies to all of you that have had good experiences here....it just didn't live up to the reviews or my expectations."

S"Ok, so after loyally following Top Chef for years now, I have always been wanting to try out Craftsteak for some time.  And happy that I did. \n \nMy husband and I arrived to Vegas Saturday late afternoon and had not made any reservation.  We checked out MGM's restaurant row and stopped by to see if Craftsteak can accommodate us.  The greeter said we can get seated at the bar right away so we gladly accepted.  The restaurant is dark and was buzzing with happy eaters.\n\nNeither of us were that hungry, so we started out with frisee salad, shared 12 oz Wagyu skirt steak, sauteed spinach and french fries seasone with paprika.  \n\nBefore we were served our food, 6 fluffy,  just out of the oven bread rolls came out to us...and they were HEAVENLY!!!!  It may have been one of the best bread I had in restaurants.  \n\nI really liked frisee salad, compared to Comme Ca's because it had more dressing and less bacon to balance out the salad.  The Wagyu skirt steak came out already sliced and were DELICIOUS.  The only complaint I have is that they got cold fairly quickly.  Spinach was well seasoned and balanced our steak well, and fries, what can I say...were sooo tasty.  My husband usually needs cups of ketchup with his fries, but these fries were seasoned so well, he ate them just by itself!\n\nI will definitely come back here!  Go Tom Colicchio!!!"

S"Once again you did not disappoint CRAFTSTEAK. We were so excited to take our friends here but also concerned whether we had over-hyped our first experience here. \n\nWe did the 3 course wagyu tasting (grade 7 meats) for $140pp. However among us four, they allowed us to do 3 orders which was more than enough food. \n\nTo start off, they have these fresh mini sweet buns that are served fresh from the oven-melt in your mouth yummy.\n\nNext 4 appetizers were served: prawns, buffala mozzarella & hazelnut, frissee salad with blue cheese & bacon( delicious, one of our favorites), wagyu tar tare.\n\nNext came the wagyu filet mignon, rib-eye, and the New York strip. Of course, the best cut and most well prepared was the filet mignon, medium rare and melt in your mouth good. However, from our last trip, the skirt steak was our favorite and still is. It was prepared to perfection and it was infused with flavor in every bite despite its lower grade. Who would've thought. Our strip did come out overdone, but we sent it back and a medium rare piece came out quickly and perfectly.\n\nAs our sides, we got the mushroom assortment, Yukon gold mash, and the garlic spinach. The highlight was of course the Yukon gold mash potatoes- creamy, buttery goodness - which was raved by all other Yelpers. Among us four we couldn't finish our 3 cut of meats.\n\nLastly, we had 6 desserts that came out. It should've been 5 but our waiter forgot our request for monkey bread and brought out another dessert by mistake. Don't worry we don't mind the extras.;)\nWe tried a variety of sorbets, cheesecake, monkey bread, apple fritters, and their bread pudding. Surprisingly, the highlight for me was the cheesecake. It was extremely light, fluffy and creamy served with blood oranges. So yummy. My hubby liked the Apple fritters most this time compared to the monkey bread which was his favorite on the last visit.\n\nOverall, another pleasant and enjoyable dining experience with great company. This will probably continue to be our go-to restaurant for steak."

I plan my meal around a few things: Lobster bisque soup, potato puree, cinnamon monkey bread.

I got the chicken which is step 2 chicken and hard to attain at most restaurants. They bring you incredibly high quality ingredients and spices. You can taste the difference even in the fingerling potatoes. The chefs back there must really have it down everything was just awesome! It is pricey our meal for 4 people with 1 whiskey drink and 4 meals and 4 sides was 400$ +so make sure you look at the prices and don't be shocked by a big bill. This place is totally worth the splurge! Will be back 100 times every chance I get I will eat here!"

The potatoes were cooked fine but the sauce was thin and flavorless and the chard was nothing special. We were so disappointed we didn't even bother staying for dessert. The only saving grace was that I was footing the bill, which was good because I felt so bad for suggesting it. What a waste of money."

S"Amazing steak house. The American grade wagyu new york strip was quite possibly the most amazing steak I have ever had. Yes, it is expensive (over $100) but it was a very big cut of meat and why not go big in Vegas? \nDespite making reservations of 8:15, we didn't get seated until about 8:30 but it was a busy weekend with March Madness (Final Four) going on. \nWe unfortunately got seated next to some construction conventioneers who were pretty wasted. They were loud and very vulgar, the F-word was about every third word out of one guys mouth, and I think Marvin our server sympathized with us. He hooked us up with an appetizer and a dessert on the house! \nI saw some people complain about the wait for the food and honestly, without Marvin bringing us out the complementary appetizer it would of been a pretty substantial wait.... A wait well worth it!"

We ordered that Kobe aged crap they had and it was horrible AND it's not supposed to be! Also, the lobster I ordered was super rubbery and the lobster bisque was yuck.

They had a table openining and were quick to clear it and get us seated.\n\nWe had the Domestic Nagyu Chef's tasting.\n\nAppetizer:\n- Shrimp Cocktail. Shrimp prepared perfectly and a cocktail sauce with perfect amount of bite.\n\nThree small salads:\n - Arugala Salad I am not a fan of Arugala salad, but theirs was excellent.\n - Persian Cucumber and Watercress, was better than average.\n - Itallian Buffalo Mozzarella with Hazelnuts, added a little twist that was very nice\n\n \nSteaks:\nRibeye and Filet for the cuts of meat. Both cooked to perfection and as very delicious.\n\nSides:\n - Brissel Sprouts, in season so on everyones menu and they didn't dissapoint\n - Au Gratin Potatoes, found out that my mother was undercooking the potatoes for my entire life. Both happy and sad at the same time, because I always loved my moms Au Gratin. Even if she were alive, I would have never told her this.\n\nDeserts:\n - Cinnamon Monkey Bread w/Vanilla Bean Ice Cream - Awesome\n - Sorbets, Coconut Lime and Rasberry\n - Chocolate Indulgence - Close second\n - Farmers Market Fruit\n\n\nThe only let down to the entire meal was that they brought us four deserts when two would have sufficed... It is simply too much after that much provided in the prior courses.\n\nThe service was top nothc from start to finish. A must stop for anyone.

S"This was my first trip to Vegas since turning 21 so I wanted to go out to an amazing restaurant while I was there. I am a big top chef fan and wanted to try Tom Colicchio's restaurant knowing it would be awesome considering how high his standards are. \n\nI went in with high expectations to this dinner and let me just say that this restaurant surpassed my expectations. I can't say enough good things about my experience at Craftsteak. \n\nFirst, we had the chilled oysters. AMAZING. I wanted 100 more of them! If you're a seafood person like myself then starting off with these is an excellent choice. They are light and won't fill you up. \n\nI had read on Craftsteak's website that the lobster bisque was one of their signature items and now I know why. Wow. It was mouth watering. Hands down one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life and I've eaten some pretty amazing food. I was blown away. You can't come to this restaurant and not order this item. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the flat iron steak. It was cooked to perfection, no surprise there. I could have cut my steak with my fork; that's how tender it was. It was absolutely delicious. But what really blew me away was the risotto. I could eat that risotto every day for the rest of my life. They should put the risotto as one of their signature items if they haven't already. \n\nAside from the spectacular food, the service was IMPECCABLE. Our server was so kind, so efficient, and just wonderful. Not only was our server terrific, but the busser and the person who ran out the food to us were so polite and nice as well. I've never had such good service before. We got drinks at the bar before our dinner and the bartenders were awesome as well. \n\nAlso, the ambiance is lovely. I loved the interior. \n\nI wanted an amazing dinner in Vegas and that was what I got an then some. Tom Colicchio has high standards as a judge on top chef and those high standards show in his restaurant as well. This was the best dinner I've ever had in my life and I cannot wait to go back and eat here again. It was a very expensive dinner but it was completely worth every penny."

S"I am not a regular meat eater so when I detour I try to make it memorable. Taking a detour at Craftsteak certainly went well beyond that expectation. We went full out and did the Chef's Beef Selection and went for the Australian A5 Wagyu that was served family style. Yes, we had salad, sides, dessert, and even two selections of beef with the whole experience. What all of the details were, however, are all a blur. The main focus was the beef and I must say it was quite amazing.\n\nIt was cooked to perfection and the texture and taste were something I have never experienced before. The service was extremely friendly and attentive as well. Bottom line it certainly exceeded my expectations and I would definitely do it again though if I did I think I would try to change it up a bit -- maybe the surf and turf? Who knows, I just would not want to wreck any exaggerated memories that build up over time for the meal we had since it is going to be hard, very hard, to match the experience again."

S'--------------------------------------------------\nESSENTIAL TIPS & EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:\n--------------------------------------------------\n# Craftsteak is in MGM Grand. Follow the signs to Wet Republic and the floor will change from carpet to smooth concrete. It\'s on your right, next to Shibuya. \n\n# The "Hawaiian" bread they serve is whatever so don\'t eat too much of it.\n\n# They can do half portions of the salads and side dishes\n\n# I recommend the Wagyu Skirt Steak (14 oz). It\'s tasty and has a nice crust. Not too hungry? Split it with 2 ppl. It\'s pricey at $79, but it\'s Wagyu.\n\n# Average steak price is around $60. Cheaper & pricier options available.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nMY EXPERIENCE: \n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThe walk to Tom Colicchio\'s Craftsteak is the same walk you\'d take to get to Wet Republic, MGM Grand\'s dayclub. It was close to dinner time when I strolled to the restaurant and as I did, I went past the opposing traffic of Wet Republicans. It was a testament that the pool scene was coming to a close. For them, it was the opposing traffic of a man who lost $120 at the poker tables and ready to blow $140 more on fine dining. Of course, that wasn\'t obvious to them. I wasn\'t wearing a scarlet letter "L" for loser or anything. \n\n[THE ATMOSPHERE]\nAs a single diner, I just sat in the lounge area of Craftsteak, right by the bar. The area was fine. It overlooked the bar\'s illuminated collection of whiskeys, gins, vodkas, and other magical tonics. Craftsteak\'s ambience is familiar and comfortable -- it is clean, sleek, and modern. It\'s not pitch black like old school steakhouses or brightly lit. The soft yellow lighting, modern furniture, and calm noise level murmurs classy. Surprisingly, I was anti-classy, but felt comfortable in a t-shirt and shorts oddly enough.  The yelpers say "dressy", but I say being dressed in clothes is good enough for this occasion. I don\'t think they enforce a dress code, but if you have a date do wear a shirt and slacks. Look who I dined with in my plain clothes -- NOBODY. \n\n[THE FOOD]\nYou will be served "Hawaiian Bread" sprinkled with sea salt on the top, in a small Staub cast iron cakepan  It\'s nicely browned on the top. It looks appetizing, smells, appetizing, but why why is the taste underwhelming? The other Yelpers are right. It\'s too delicate in texture and taste for it to go with steak. I mean the taste is just flat and blander than actual Hawaiian bread. They need a heartier bread. \n\nI wanted to eat some vegetables instead of eating just steak. However, the side dishes and salads seemed like too much food and a waste of money. At $13-15 for a salad or side dish uhhh probably not.  But, the server allowed me to get half orders of the Persian Cucumber salad and the Snap Peas for my side dish. Now that\'s more reasonable!  Now, I can get some dose of fiber and vitamins for EDC Day 2 recovery. The Persian Cucumber salad had a nice clean taste, but it was on the plain side. I just tasted fresh leafy greens and light oil with a tiny bit of zest from the ginger. I wanted more OOMMPH from the salad.  If you want a simple salad, this is your dish. Avoid this one if you expect more from your leafy greens. \n\nMy medium-rare Wagyu Skirt Steak (14 oz.) was very tasty for a lack of a better word. It had a decent caramelized crust on both sides and the dish itself was surrounded by a small pool of sauce. I love when I bite into a steak that has a full crust over it -- you get that sweet taste of caramel, marbling fat, and protein in every bite...but my Skirt Steak only had a decent crust so I didn\'t feel all of the magic. But I will say that the skirt steak was still an excellent choice and highly recommended under the Yelp tips section. I have no idea what kind of reduction was in the steak\'s pan, but it paired very well with the meat. You couldn\'t really taste the sauce unless you dipped your fork in and only tasted that. \n\nMy belief on pairings (whether it\'s wine/meat, sake/fish, sauces/food) is if your taste buds can\'t really notice the contrast between the 2 flavors, it means they complement each other very well. In my example, the sauce and steak almost blend into each other unnoticed. Hence, a great pairing. The glass of Pinot Noir I got wasn\'t a perfect pairing with the steak, but it was easy to drink with its fruit and warm spice notes  -- c\'mon it\'s a Pinot. It can do no wrong. I got a serving of fruit out of it. Fruits, vegetables, carbs, and meat...the U.S. government should be proud of me for having a balanced, elitist meal. \n\nI skipped dessert because it was a no no on the U.S. Food Plate diagram. Just kidding. I was just too full. \n\n[THE SERVICE] \nThe server was polite and attentive. Everybody from the water guy to the steak delivery man checked up on you to see if you needed anything or if you were satisfied. I liked the service. I\'ll see how the service stacks up when I get an actual table with peeps'

S"I went here a few nights ago and there was 4 of us for dinner. We couldn't decide on what to order, since everything on the menu looked so good. After much back and forth, we finally decided to get the chef's selection domestic wagyu. For the Chef's selection, the nice thing about it is, you had to order a minimum of 2 orders, but you didn't have to order for one per person if that makes sense. We had 4 people and we did 3 orders of the domestic wagyu plus the lobster bisque. \n\nWe didn't know what we were going to get, so it was all a surprise. The plate of warm salted bread came out first and I thought that was okay, it was very soft, but it tasted a little dry. Next came out the lobster bisque, even though we just ordered one, our waiter brought out a small bowl for the other 3 to try as well, so I thought that was really nice of him. Next came our appetizers, we had a salad, heirloom tomatoes and there was one more dish, but I can't seem to remember what it was. After the appetizers came our steak, we got 3 different cuts, the filet mignon, the skirt steak and the rib eye with 3 sides, the potato puree, the brentwood corn (YUM!) and then assorted mushrooms. My favorite was by far the filet mignon, it was so tender, I could cut it with the back of my knife. The skirt steak had a great flavor to it and I think our ribeye may have been cooked medium well, vs the medium rare that we ordered. We didn't finish our steak between 4 people, we were pretty stuffed already and no one really knew if we were getting dessert. 5 minutes later we got 5 dessert dishes, boy were we in for something we couldn't finish. We got an assorted ice cream, mixed fruits, creme brulee, a chocolate cake and finally monkey bread. After this meal I think we all had food coma! \n\nI would definitely come back here! the food is so delicious and I think I would probably try a different chef's selection next time."

I wish I could have this meal over again! Very highly recommended. Pricey but worth the splurge for a special occasion.'

S"You don't get much better than Craftsteak.  Tucked in the back of MGM Grand, I feel like Craftsteak might be overlooked by a lot of people, even with Tom Colicchio's name plastered out front.  For everyone who has passed on Craftsteak, you missed out.  \n\nCraftsteak is simple, elegant, and executes everything perfectly.  There aren't a lot of frills, foams, or tacky decor - form follows function, and quality follows form.\n\nYou won't be overwhelmed by a large appetizer menu, which is perfectly fine with me - start with a seafood starter or a salad, I suggest the lobster bisque and the caesar, respectively, and you'll be happy.  The main focus are the steaks, which are fantastic - well portioned, perfectly cooked, and well presented.  If you have some extra money to blow, there are multiple steak menus available (Prime, Domestic Wagyu, and Australian Wagyu), along with a multiple person chef's selection beef menu that is meant for sharing and sampling.  The sides are fantastic as well, my favorites being the asparagus and the potato puree.  But, perhaps the best part of the meal...the bread.  I have never had bread simple melt in my mouth like the soft, warm pillows of heaven that are served in cast iron pans.  If I could eat their bread for every meal for the rest of my life, I would in a heartbeat, it's just that good.\n\nThe decor is modern, and the atmosphere is excellent - quiet and subdued, but still trendy and upscale.  The waitstaff is excellent, and each table is visited at least once by a sommelier.  \n\nAll things considered, Craftsteak is one of the best steakhouses in Vegas, and one of the best high-end restaurants in Vegas, period.  You will pay handsomely for your meal, but it is well worth the quality of the entire experience.  If you want a good hunk of beef, you will not be disappointed with Craftsteak, as it is consistently one of the best (and one of my favorite) restaurants on the strip."

S"My boyfriend and I made reservations to dine here because his friend highly recommended this steak house.  Our reservation was on December 27. 2011, at 6PM.  We arrived on time and was seated promptly. The decor was simple, yet elegant.  Think lots of dark wood and spacious seating arrangements.  \n\nOur waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and suggested we go with the chef's tasting menu.  For $120 per person, we were on our way to sample a trio of starters, a dual of angus steaks, a trio of side dishes, and FOUR different desserts!  The fourth dessert was added because I mentioned we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday (even though it was still days away, LOL).  \n\nFor starters, we were served the cocktail prawns, warm frisee salad, and the lobster bisque.  The prawns were perfect.  My favorite starter was the salad.  It was just absolutely delicious. \n\nFor sides to accompany our steaks, we were served the mashed potatoes, mushroom assortment, and risotto.  My favorite was the mushrooms.  Our angus steaks included one ribeye and one New York strip.  Both were prepared perfectly.\n\nAs you can imagine, when dessert time rolled around, we were already pretty stuffed.  $120 per person is on the expensive side, but the chef really gives you way more than enough food.  For dessert, we were served the cinnamon monkey bread, sorbet,  farmer's market fruit plate, and a flourless chocolate cake with ice cream.  The monkey bread was my favorite.  It tasted like a gourmet cinnamon roll.\n\nOverall, the service was superb and the food was good.  I wouldn't say it's the best steak I ever had, but as far as the tasting menu goes, it's the best value.  However, we ate only half of the food and couldn't take it back to the hotel because we were off to see Ka."

S"My husband and I went with another couple and everyone was happy...which never happens!  We ordered the family style or shared menu and it was excellent and filling for only $60 per person (not including tax, gratuity and drinks), $100 per person after all was said and done.  That included a choice of three appetizers, a few meal selections and sides, a beautiful dessert assortment and a glass of wine with each course.  OUTSTANDING!!!  You don't need to order for the total amount of people in your group either.  We ordered for 3 and got two additional sides.  I was leery going into it because it takes a lot to fill my husband, but this hit the spot!"

S"We came here for my 25th birthday dinner when the SBC was in Vegas and it had to be the highlight for me of the trip. \n\nPrior to arriving in Vegas I had made plans with Craftsteak to accomodate our large party. Because there were about 19 of us, we had to make sure that they could even accommodate us since it was a Sat night at prime dinner time and they did, all that was involved was a 6 page contract and a $500 deposit. Just dealing with that part was a pain, hence the -1 star but it is understandable. \n\nBut when we got there, after a little delay in getting us seated since the people who were sitting at one of the tables we were getting took forever to sign their check and get up, we were seated and the fun began. Shortly after sitting, the hostess apologized for the wait and gave everyone at the table a complimentary shot of a yummy Polish vodka, an awesome way to start the meal. \n\nThen all the delicious food started coming out. I had the wine pairing with my meal as well and all of it went perfectly!\n- First the bread was absolutely amazing. With some butter that just melted into the warm bread served in a skillet, I was in heaven from the start.\n- Appetizer Course: Shaved Fennel Salad, Shrimp (I believe this was in place of the quail), Buffalo Mozzarella with Red Pepper Caponata\nPersian Cucumber Salad (all delicious but of course me being the huge seafood lover I am, I adored the shrimp with the juicy shrimp head. Wine Pairing: A very clean and smooth riesling\n- Main Entree: Prime Beef Flat Iron, Angus Skirt Steak, Diver Sea Scallops- All steak was cooked perfectly, not too well done at all and the scallops were fresh, juicy and divine! Wine Pairing: A red, can't remember what at that point since I shared it with my bro \n- Sides: Yukon Gold Potato Pur\xc3\xa9e, Saut\xc3\xa9ed Sweet Corn, Roasted Shiitake Mushrooms- All were great. I loved how the potato puree just melted in my mouth and the sweet corn was amazing. \n- Dessert: Chef's Selection which included an apple crisp, 5 types of sorbet- strawberry and I can't remember the other 4 and other delicious desserts. Wine Pairing- A muscato (my favorite of the 3!)\n\n- My special birthday cake: Sent by Michelle A. cuz she couldn't make it with help by Po. An amazing chocolate cake with my fave, strawberries in the middle. Thank you so much you two, so delicious and reading the note made me feel so nice and loved, you guys rock!\n\nService was so on point the entire time. Our server Blue really was extremely accommodating and did everything to make sure we had a great time.  Thank you to Craftsteak for putting up with us, I know we were definitely on the louder side but we had a blast. \n\nThank you all for going and woot to a wonderful dinner at Craftsteak."

S"It pains me to write this, but Craftsteak was a letdown. Or, rather, the steak was a letdown, and, at that price, a letdown feels pretty devastating. \n\nEverything but the steak, though, was great. The decor was hip and elegant and comfortable. The service was impeccable.  The corn was the best we've ever had--it was an actual revelation. Ditto the fruit and monkeybread.\n\nBut you don't got to Craftsteak for corn or fruit or monkeybread. You go for steak, and our steaks (domestic Wagyu) were overcooked, and not particularly flavorful.  I've had better, several times, and for far less money. \n\nSo, if I had to do it again, here's what I would do differently:\n\nNo Wagyu.\n\nNo tasting menu. Two tasting menus for two people = an obscene amount of food. One appetizer or salad, one or two sides, and two entrees would be a much better proposition."

S'The food was amazing, though I\'ve never been so full in my life! We decided to splurge and ordered the three-course tasting menu featuring domestic wagyu beef. After asking us which appetizers and cuts we were particularly interested in, our waiter proceeded to bring us four full appetizers, two 10-12oz steaks, and three deserts. He remarked to us, "we don\'t like to do those down-sized tasting portions like french restaurants.". I\'ll say! Everything was delicious--probably the best steak house food we\'ve ever had, including not only the melt-in-your-mouth amazing filet mignon, but knock-your-socks-off sides of roasted corn, creamy mashed potatoes, and mixed mushrooms--and the service was impeccable, but on reflection I wish they\'d given us slightly less food and charged us slightly less money. When the food is that expensive (and yummy), you really want to eat it all, but no one should really eat that much in one meal, even if it\'s by Tom Colicchio.'

S'You know I really cant find any reason NOT to give this place a 5 star rating!  Good steak, good service, good sides (potatoes, salds etc...)\n\nWhen in Vegas you have a zillion choices for a good meal.  I go to Las Vegas about 10 times per year so have tried just about every restraunt in town and most outside of the strip as well.  This place should be one on your list for business dinner or just a fun night out.  \nNot so much for a romantic dinner though.'

S"I went here with my fiance, and let me tell you that being a foodie and fan of Top Chef, this place is definitely one to go to. \n\nThis was a truly amazing meal and for this to be my first YELP ever I hope I do you Yelpers justice and don't forget anything.\n\nWe had a reservation for 9:00PM and waited at the bar until our table was ready, they were very prompt at seating us and got us a booth, we sat down and the waiter service was excellent, they got us the menus, the wait staff were all very knowledgeable and actually helped us to make our decisions.  Our waiter, Francisco advised us on the everything and asked us what are some things that we liked.  We decided NOT to go with the Chefs Tasting Menu as we weren't that hungry, because the portions are HUGE, so here is the detail of what we did have...\n\nBread: \nThey brought out these little pillows of bread in its own little baking tray, these things are AWESOME, soft and pillowy (is that even a word)! They had great texture, a little crispy on the top, very light and airy, and perfectly buttered and then sprinkled with a little kosher salt.  Sweet and salty and buttery all in one, I think we had about two or three trays of this stuff.\n\nAppetizers:  \nLobster bisque - we shared this and they even asked us if we wanted it in to be served in separate bowls which we did, and even then I still feel that it was a good sized portion, the bisque was flavorful and rich and creamy and smooth, with good amounts of lobster pieces in each bowl, my only regret is that I wish we got our own, because neither one of us wanted to share!!!!\n\nMains: \nFor me, I got the 16oz bone in rib eye, cooked to a perfect medium rare.  \n\nFiance, got the Surf and Turf (Filet and  1/2 Lobster) also cooked to perfection.  \n\nSides: \nHen of the Woods Mushroom - This was by far the BEST mushrooms that I have ever had and I LOVE MUSHROOMS, at first sight they didn't look too appetizing as they really don't look like your traditional mushroom side dish, but they are truly awesome, the texture is amazing, they were crispy and soft and chewy and melt in you mouth all at the same time, man I want some of these things right NOW, and the flavor wow I'M speechless.\n\nYukon Gold Puree - much better than your standard fair mash potatoes, creamy and buttery.\n  \nDesserts:\nWe were WAY TOO FULL to have dessert, but from what we did see they looked amazing!\n\nAll in all this was one on the best dining experiences that I have ever had, and what's even better for me is that I have FINALLY turned my fianc\xc3\xa9 into a foodie (she never really understood why I would watch the Food Network and Top Chef all the time) and now she wants to try out everything while we are here in Vegas.  My next review will be Hubert Keller's Burger Bar, but that's another awesome meal and review.  \n\nOne last thing to mention as we were waiting for our check, at the table next to us sits down Pierre Gagnaire 3 star Michelin chef who just opened Twist restaurant at Mandarin Oriental in Las Vegas, the perfect ending to a perfect dining experience."
